"""Just disgusting""",1,2022-02-10,"Not Verified | Just disgusting. Flight canceled a month after payment. No reason, no compensation. I am now forced to look for how to get through other airlines, when there are no normal tickets. I will have to fly with an 8 hour layover at 5am!

"""ever fly Cyprus Airlines again""",1,2020-06-14,"Contrary to almost all airlines in this Covid-19 situation, who allow rebooking at no fee or a voucher, Cyprus Airways have decided they will give NO voucher or rebooking for next year. Hence you either fly - even if your family includes people at risk (my partner who was traveling with me - or you lose 80% of your (expensive) flight. We weren’t even asking for a reimbursement and we would have accepted to pay a change fee. But Spring/Summer 2021 timetables are not published and they don’t do vouchers (only airport taxes). Even if we lose our full ticket, we will never fly Cyprus Airlines again. All airlines are in difficult situations but it is in these moments that service and « fair rules » make all the difference in the world. Never again with them - even if I pay more or make a stopover. Shame on them.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Geneva to Larnaca,June 2020,,,,,1,,True,
"""satisfied with this airline""",7,2019-11-29,"Larnaca to Athens. A small airline yet efficient. In my case the plane was clean, seating was very comfortable, we had a great welcome from the attendants, though I cannot comment on inflight service since I had none. If you need something you have to pay for it. Flight was smooth, and arrived ahead of schedule with a captain that kept us posted on our flight. On the negative side, their in flight magazine in only English, and not in Greek as well. Probably only for English speaking passengers.

"""there was no one there""",1,2019-08-04,"Larnaca to Athens. I was about to board with a friend of mine in a flight scheduled at 10:40 local time. Due to the traffic we had approximately arrived at the airport at 10:05. We rushed into the check in stand but there was no one there, we were informed that the guy had just left so even if we had taken our tickets we wouldnt be able to board the flight since there was no one there to check our hand luggage. Customer service was not answering, we were panicked and when they finally decided to pick up the phone they informed us that we wont be able to board even if the boarding phase was not actually ongoing. Thus we lost our tickets, had to overpay a ticket for later that day and destroy our vacations for merely 5 mins, just because they wouldn't pick up the phone and rush to leave their posts.T",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Larnaca to Athens,August 2019,1,1,,1,1,,False,
"""Terrible customer service""",1,2019-06-21,Larnaca to Beirut. It’s worthless. Boarding pass says be to the airport 3 hours ahead but check in doesn’t even open 2 hours ahead. With these basic fare they make you check your carry on and thus you have to wait until check in opens. Terrible customer service.

"""cannot run a flight on schedule""",2,2019-06-04,"My flight from Larnaca to Athens was half an hour late. My return flight was scheduled for Sunday 2/6 flight CY 4311 Athens to Larnaca which is operated as I learned at the airport, by Blue air, leaving at 20.45 arriving at 22.30. No prior advice neither at airport and finally we left at 22.45 , that is with a delay of 1 hour and 25 minutes. Hence we arrived at destination at a very ridiculous time, that is at 00.10 hours. Delays can happen on all airlines but when such delays are a daily feature on this particular flight and Blue Air, then things start getting strange, in that on the flight tracker for this flight, in the last 30 days not once has this flight gone on schedule. Every day a delay of one to two hours! One whole month with not one single punctual flight, whether the aircraft is late to arrive from another flight is really not our concern and if they cannot run a flight on schedule then they are not serious.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to Larnaca,June 2019,3,3,,1,2,,False,

One would think like on-line check in is the business as usual for most companies on the planet and a must for all the airlines operating in EU. Until you fly Cyprus Airways. Despite the fact that already in August Cyprus announced that ""The online check-in service is available for all the flights departing from Larnaca, Tel Aviv and St. Petersburg. More destinations will be introduced in the coming months."", the reality is that on-line check in still not available. There are also no self-check in kiosks at the airport in Larnaca, the home base of Cyprus Airways. Rather than that, I was advised by Cyprus Airways staff to get to check in 2.5 hrs before the departure, i.e.in case of my flight at 4:30am!
