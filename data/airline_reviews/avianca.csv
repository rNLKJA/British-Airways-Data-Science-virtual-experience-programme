Luckily, I didn't 'need' to get a COVID test, but they did harass me and request tons of random personal information at their desk as well as ask me for multiple unnecessary affidavits (which I filled out this time, expecting a repeat of their antics) before reluctantly giving me a boarding pass.  In the terminal for our return flight, I tried to request assistance in unloading since our layover was very short, and the boarding assistant tried to CANCEL my flight, since i 'seemed worried about the layover'. Then she wouldn't hand my ticket back until I had re-proved I had my affidavits and COVID test etc. They also came around the terminal and checked a ton of people's bags due to limited cabin space (not completely unusual, but added to the stress especially given our layover).

To top everything off I compared how much my friend paid for his checked luggage at the counter that was 50lbs and told me $19.33 while I paid around $22 for a small 10kg bag.

But no, I have to pay almost $1,000 in fees and penalties to upgrade myself to first class just to be able to change my flight since you treat S and XS ticket holders like trash. Icing on the cake is that you can clearly see on Google flights that it would only cost $600 for a one-way ticket if I’d wait 2 days to fly out. Their website is not user friendly, the customer hotline was very unhelpful, and I was told the supervisor didn’t have time to talk to me or there wasn't one available. My experience was similar when talking to the customer service department at the Managua Airport in Nicaragua and that a manager was unavailable. I was obviously pretty stressed and as a non-native Spanish speaker it was difficult to try and explain my situation in Spanish, but even when a bilingual American tried to help me they still weren’t willing to budge. Lastly their staff seems to be completely incompetent telling me I need to pay them $1200, when I can clearly do it online and get a result of $962 (still ridiculous).

I used to enjoy flying Avianca compared to any American airline.  Sadly this airline started going downhill in 2019 when they announced they were bankrupt, the service started to get reduced but was still good compared to what they offer today. After covid, this airline has taken the low cost approach. What they pass as ""business"" class is a complete joke. The same food they give to economy is the same meal they give to business. They no longer give you alcohol at all, nothing during the boarding process either. No blankets, pillows or kit. All of that is gone. You have to ask the FAs for any other drink which is boxed juice or coffee, some cans of coca cola or small bottles of water. The Flight Attendants were still nice like they always have been but they are noticeably not as visible as they used to. Not once did they check up on me during the flight like the used to, the lead FA did not introduce themselves to us either. Before covid they would greet us by name and ask if we wanted anything to drink or anything else. It looks like they are getting rid of business class altogether soon so I guess they don't care about business class customers at this point. It looks like they returned all their newer planes and only kept the older TACA fleet probably since they have already been paid off at this point. The first leg of my trip was on a newer A319 from 2014. But I got stuck with the same old A320 on the rest of my legs and this plane was from 2004. On one of the flights, the FA made an announcement that due to covid they were not going to have any in flight service so no movie being played on the overhead screens on this older plane allegedly because of covid. Seems like Avianca is using covid as an easy scapegoat for reducing any type of service and reducing costs. At the end of the day, I'm not a fan of the low cost approach. They are providing low cost service and product yet the airfares are not low cost fares. I paid more for my flight now than I did precovid. If they're going to switch to low cost it should also reflect on the airfare cost as well not just in the product they are offering. I don't understand how this supposed low cost airline is still part of Star Alliance. I'm sure they're going to get kicked out once they get rid of business class altogether. This airline went from a Skytrax award winning airline to a disgrace in a span of 3 years. If you flew this airline precovid and haven't flown it since then, please prepare yourself since it is not the same airline. If you can, fly a different airline that does not charge you legacy airline prices for a low cost product.

"""I do NOT recommend""",2,2022-06-24,"London to Medellin via Bogota. It is sad to write this review since Avianca was my favorite airline, but many things have changed and not necessarily for the better. It should be noted that on the B787 aircraft, the seats in both, business and economy class are still very comfortable and on a par with other star alliance member airlines such as Singapore Airlines, Turkish, United, etc. The big difference is in the service and food on board. On this particular flight, the offer for business class was two kinds of pasta served on a plastic container, a sandwich for starters and an ice cream for dessert. When I asked the crew if there was any other option, with obvious embarrassment she told me that it was the only option since this was a temporary menu due to Covid. Curiously, other airlines have resumed and even improved their menu on board, which clearly indicates that this is just an excuse to cut costs. The airline has also introduced new fares (XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL) The only fare that still includes 2 pieces of baggage in business is XXL, which is the same as a full fare business. Back in 2019 you were able to check in 2 bags in both, business and economy (32kg each in business and 23kg in economy) Sadly now is all gone. Most tickets are Size S which means you still pay what you used to pay back in 2019 if not more, but if you want to check in even just one bag you are looking at least £100GBP. The frequent flyer program Life miles has also changed for the worst, Accrual was previously based on distance, now it is based of the price paid for the ticket, excluding any taxes. In this occasion I've earned a total of 920 miles for the LHR-BOG sector. If you consider that the fare often exceeds the £1300GBP for one way and that you need 11.500 to reach Silver, 80% of which must be flown with Avianca, it is almost impossible to achieve elite status and perhaps also the most difficult program to achieve status in any airline member of star alliance. The inflight entertainment has been reduced to just a few old movies, no music, no games. Apart from the 787 and a couple A330, all IFE screens are being gradually removed. The only saving grace is being the only airline to fly directly between the UK and Colombia, but apart from that there isn't much to look forward to. Sadly, I do NOT recommend Avianca, better service, baggage allowance, on board food, and reasonable prices to reach Colombia can be found by just having and extra stop in Madrid (Iberia, Air Europa), Frankfurt (Lufthansa), Paris (Air France), Amsterdam (KLM), and even in Istanbul with Turkish Airlines.",True,Boeing 787-8,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Medellin via Bogota,June 2022,4,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,1,False

First, my Avianca rep told me that I would need to pay an extra $150 in order to board my plane to leave Ecuador, a fee which my friends did not have to pay. After speaking with the manager, they dropped my cost to $80, which I paid so that way I could board my plane and not miss my flight. On top of that, I was told that my luggage could not be checked all the way to my final destination and instead I would have to grab my luggage, get a Covid test and then recheck my baggage at my next stop, something my friends also did not have to do. After completing everything I was told to do, I went to recheck my bag but was told I was too late and that baggage check had closed a couple minutes ago and there was nothing they could do to help me. I explained that I was following the orders from the previous Avianca rep, but they still would not assist me and my customer service rep was very rude.

I went to the airport and asked for help. The woman behind the counter left me standing. I am in the business class line and have business class tickets. She did not listen and she did not help me. I finally went to the gate and tried there, but the same woman moved there. She said at the counter that there were no other flights. At the gate she instead said that she cannot make changes from Santiago. All changes had to happen when I reached Bogota. Then in Bogota the agent said there is nothing he can do. I asked to even go to a different airport or whatever would work. I was in Bogota all day. I then asked for lounge access because the Internet wasn’t working. Instead he handed me a coupon for a Burger King hamburger meal and sent me on. I missed my holiday and family, and I had a horrible experience. I was exhausted and on the floor at the airport trying to charge my phone so I could contact my family. Even if I could not be helped, I could have been treated kindly. I was crying when I left the agent. I will advise others at work and home to avoid Avianca in the future based on how I was treated. The final straw is that I could not even file a complaint because their complaint system would never accept the complaint and kept cycling or advising that there were invalid characters. I tested sending only 1 character and it still would not submit so they are mechanically keeping people from providing negative feedback.",True,,Business,Business Class,Santiago to San Francisco via Bogota,July 2019,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,1,False
"""never fly with Avianca again""",1,2019-06-23,"Los Angeles to Bogota. The night before, I got an email requesting to check in with their “web check-in”, so I did. After the web check-in, Avianca sent an email with my boarding pass stating “If you only have carry-on luggage, please go directly to the boarding gate.” I only had carry on luggage, so I went directly to Terminal 3 as my boarding pass stated. After passing extensive security at Terminal 3, I looked for Avianca booths or staff but I couldn’t find any. After asking around, airport staff directed me on a shuttle bus to Terminal 2. Once I got to Terminal 2, airport staff redirected me to Terminal B. Once I got to Terminal B, airport staff said my boarding gate had not been assigned yet because it wasn’t on the monitor yet, but it would be departing from one of the gates in the same room we were in and my flight should be on one of the monitors in that section in a couple hours as it got closer to the departure time. I was in the departure area where I was told it would depart from 38 minutes before it was scheduled to depart and 51 minutes before it did depart but there weren’t any planes departing to BOG and my flight wasn’t anywhere on the monitor it was supposed to be. Airport staff didn’t see it on the monitor either. I went to two other airport staff and one of them looked up my flight with an app on his phone. Terminal 3 was listed as the departure gate so he told me I needed to go there. I took the shuttle bus back to Terminal 3, but there weren’t any Avianca booths or staff so I went over to an Alaska Airlines booth. The lady tried to help me but wasn’t able to see any Avianca departing gate info from her computer. She told me to go to the Avianca front desk outside of Terminal 3 security checkpoint. By the time I got to the Avianca front desk it was too late to get through security fast enough to make my flight. The Avianca supervisor told me there was a flight to BOG 26 hours later but that she couldn’t wave the rescheduling fee but that customer service may be able to. There shouldn’t have been a charge since I did everything I was instructed to do by Avianca, but she told me I should have checked in at the Avianca front desk before going through the security checkpoint at Terminal 3. I showed her my email from Avianca with my boarding pass instructing me to “go directly to the boarding gate” but she had no response. The supervisor then connected me to customer service to discuss possibly waiving the rescheduling fee. After talking with customer service and being on hold several times, totaling about 2 hours, they provided no alternative besides paying around $1,300 for the next day flight change. I decided not to pay an extra $1,300 to an airline for their mistakes and bought a $400 ticket back home to Seattle with a different airline. I Should have never been provided the web check-in option and told to bypass the Avianca front desk if Avianca provides no reliable way to find the correct departure gate. The flight AV89 should have been displayed on the monitors in Terminal B with all of the other flights. Avianca’s incompetence cost me about $1,600 total and tons of wasted time. I tried to resolve this through Avianca’s dispute resolution process, but they made me jump through endless hoops, accidentally closing my case many times.

"""attendants seemed friendly""",7,2019-03-04,"Lima to Cusco. I was happy to see that the tour agency that booked all my tickets booked me on Avianca, as they were a star alliance member. This meant I could use my Royal Orchid Plus Gold privileges. Our whole itinerary was from Buenos Aires all the way to New York City, making stops along the way. One thing that made me wonder straight from check in was the matter of people trying to cut queues by going to the Business class line. I went up showing my gold bag tag (I had lost my wallet hence my gold card) and the guy still asked for my name. This happened at two of the three airports I had to check in at. Star Alliance lounge in Buenos Aires is crowded not because of lack of capacity, but because too many priority pass users were getting in. When I went there they had stopped admitting priority pass but thankfully my star gold status was enough to admit me plus my mum. Due to the amount of people, I could not connect to the lounge wifi. That is quite a bummer for any lounge. Boarding was organised from A to F, with star gold getting group B. I actually liked this more than boarding with business class passengers as you can board in a more orderly fashion. I settled in seat 7K, but as two rows behind us were empty, i opted to sit by myself and give my mum an empty seat next to her for more comfort. The seat is similar to Thai airways in two aspects; it had massive legroom and a footrest. Something much appreciated on a long flight. After takeoff, service didn’t commence until halfway through the flight, and the flight attendants explained this was due to the turbulent weather while flying over the Andes. At least I ate in the lounge. A paper box served on a flimsy tray with a yoghurt, and inside the box was a potato cake which seemed to be too salty. Food on Avianca seemed to be of okay quality, not comparable to Thai airways or ANA, all of which are in the same alliance. The paper box makes the food look cheap but for environmental quality it seemed okay. We had to go to re check our bags in Lima for our flight to Cusco, and that flight was uneventful. For our flight from Cusco to New York via Bogotá, I asked for an upgrade at check in. This was met with a very quick yes. Unfortunately there was no lounge either in Lima or Cusco. Lima is a hub airport so why is there no lounge!? The boarding pass still showed I was in economy, but at the gate they said “you were already upgraded at checkin, here are your new seat numbers.” This was an older business class and I found that the seat was merely just wider and had better service. The food was still so-so but I finished as I was hungry. Apparently for our overnight in Bogotá, we found out our luggage didn’t make it to Bogotá, due to weight constraints. They arrived four hours later after being rerouted. Re-checking the bags in Bogotá, I was put first on the standby upgrade list. I wasn’t upgraded as all business class passengers checked in. The Avianca lounge left a lot to be desired. The Star Alliance Lounge finder with my filters put on indicated I could use the diamond lounge, but I was denied access and directed to the gold lounge. I was wondering why the New York flight is frequently delayed upwards of an hour, and I found out that they do strip searches at the gate. But this was to select passengers and they delay the entire flight. This was more or less the same story, and flight attendants seemed friendly.

However, several months after booking, the plane was changed to some airline company we've never heard of, and our seats were separated (we were able to change the seats to be together). Although we weren't familiar with the plane, we presumed that the Avianca would give us a plane that was comparable to the Dreamliner, especially with the length of the flight. However, once onboard it quickly became apparent, that our 10 hour flight was not going to be what we booked or expected. Toilets didn't flush. My legs were actually up against the seat in front of me, and when the seat was reclined I was actually pinned in, couldn't move, and therefore the seat couldn't go all the way back. My husband ended up moving to the row across from me, just so that I could stretchout. They ran out of food - no egg meals, no milk for the cereal. No air vents for either fresh air. It was so warm and stagnant you could hardly breath, and they claimed they couldn't lower the temp. This plane had to be the worst and most uncomfortable experience of my flying career and when we paid for the Dreamliner, we are extremely disappointed. What was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime started out a complete nightmare. We have been attempting to file this complaint, however, first they could not find our locator number, so we had to find our tickets. So now we have our tickets and they can't take a complaint in English. We were finally able to file the complaint, we were granted a $200 voucher, but as of today, we've yet to see or hear anything more from Avianca.

First of all we were greeted at the airport by some extremely friendly staff members; who personally guided us to the check in zone. After a short queue at the check in zone, I was guided to the exclusive dock inside the terminal where only Avianca flights operate. This made the terminal a lot less crowded than the other dock where Latam, VivaColombia, Wingo and all the other carriers operate. The boarding process was fast and efficient and the flight departed 10 minutes before schedule and the cabin crew members were extremely polite; to the point that upon boarding the airplane I was personally greeted with my name (“good morning and welcome aboard Mr Castro” said the flight attendant). The plane was very clean and although it was one of the old members of Avianca’s fleet (built in 2011), it was as comfortable as all the other members of Avianca's fleet. To my surprise despite the flight being around 50 minutes long it had generous legroom a (I was not on a bulkhead or Exit rows), a huge seat, a personal IFE on every seat and we were given fresh fruit and a croissant on this short early morning flight. The fact that we had an inflight meal on a 50 minute flight is amazing to me as all American carriers I flew (except Delta and JetBlue) don’t even give inflight free meals on international flights that are 3 hours long. Upon arrival at Cartagena everything was as efficient as at El Dorado. My bags were some of the last ones off the plane and it only took me 10 minutes from the moment I walked off the airplane to the moment I walked off the airport doors. Overall it was a fantastic experience, I can’t wait for my next leg of the trip (back to Bogota and then to London Heathrow) to come and if you are flying to Colombia or anywhere in South America it definitely is the airline that you have to fly.",True,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bogotá to Cartagena,March 2018,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",4,5,,,True

The flight itself was ok, no major things that made me love or hate the airline during the flight.

No luggage was lost or broken. On some flights we were changed to an earlier one because we arrived early at the airport. This would save our connecting flights in case of a delay. Long haul flights London to Bogota on a Boeing 787 with OK service/food. Legroom for a 1,93m/6ft4in like me is an issue so that's why I booked seat with extra legroom. What needs to be improved urgently is the customer service, over chat or phone. The agents have an issue with English and as a result it takes long to communicate. Furthermore seat booking MUST be made available online, not only over the phone.

(4-5x per year). We were traveling with our son, a minor, for this flight also. Our usual route of travel is from New York (JFK) to Santa Marta Colombia (SMR). With a stop in Bogota. Avianca used a third party company for our flight from NYC to Bogota and it was awful (“Wamos”, was the name of the partner airline). The airplane was very old, dirty, and no entertainment system. Also the flight attendant gave us a menu with 3 choices of food, when it was time to order our food, we were told the only choice was breakfast burritos. We were amoung the first people served. Having a menu was useless. The seats were not comfortable at all. We were not able to rest. Those combinations made for a very uncomfortable, long and boring flight. Coming back home was even worse. Again Avianca used the same company to bring us back. Needless to say, it was an old airplane, poor seats, no entertainment system, and low quality food once again. The food was worse this time. We could not eat it. So we traveled uncomfortable, bored, and hungry. I understand Avianca is having some issues with their pilots and are using different ways to transport their clients. There has to be a better solution. We the customer should not have to suffer thru low quality service for the same price. Avianca should respect their clients and partner with a better company to provide the same quality service. You should not charge for a premium service when you are not delivering (what we pay for) premium service. We traveled business class for a reason. We wanted to be comfortable and rested. We will state once again, we had a horrible experience! I will not recommend travel using Avianca until they fix the problems with their pilots.

"""a flight they cancelled on me""",1,2018-01-31,"New York to Cartagena. We booked two business class tickets for a direct fight to Cartagena that was supposed to land at noon, so we can make our boat connection to Rosario Islands. A week before our trip, we got a notice from Avianca that due to the strike, they had to reroute us through Medellin. The new flight with the layover would bring us to Cartagena at 4:30 PM which meant we would miss our boat connection. I went to the NYC office to cancel those flights and had to book a new flight with Jet Blue last minute. The agent who filled out all the cancellation forms told us it will take 6-8 weeks of the refund. At 6 weeks I called the headquarters to see what is the status of the refund. They told me to have patience and it will be more around 8 weeks. They also said they would escalate the case. At 8 weeks I called again and this time they said it will be more like 3 months to get the refund, but they reassured me they would escalate the case again. The following week I went back to the agent in NYC to see what she can do. She discovered that the claim was still pending and had been “Neglected” (her words). She told me it would serve me better to start a new claim to get new attention to the case, and she reassured me that this would not mean that I would lose my turn and have to wait another 3 months from then. At 2 months and 3 weeks I called the headquarters again, and with such chutzpah they told me my new claim was filed only a week ago and I need to wait for 90 days from the new claim to get my refund, which would mean basically 6 months from the date of the cancelled flight. As I really refused to take no for an answer, they put me through to the manager. She told me the reason the NYC agent issued me a new claim number was because there was a mistake in the way the original claim was filed and it had been rejected, not neglected. Meanwhile, nobody had bothered to call me when such rejection was done to tell me there was problem with the claim and see how we can fix it. She was also adamant that she cannot do anything else at this moment and that I will have to wait 90 more days from the filing of the new claim to see my refund. She again said she will escalate the matter, which by now we all know means nothing. She refused to give any assistance at all. Many phone calls to the headquarters and a few trips to the NYC local office, I’m still not even sure when or how I will ever get back the money from my two round trip business class seats on Avianca. They were happy to take thousands of dollars from me, changed our tickets on us without consulting us first, and now are creating all kinds of roadblocks and delay tactics in refunding the money. Even though they made a mistake in filing of the refund claim, they never bothered admitting to their mistake, nor are they taking any responsibility for a mistake that was done by their agent.

Both my wife and I were very excited to fly the Boeing 787 but Avianca is really falling behind on the business class category due to its below par service and inadequate boarding process that could be easily be corrected should they choose to do so.

Upon landing in Lima Airport, we needed to rush to catch our connecting flight to Santiago. As we were seated at at row number 1 (the very front row), we were expecting to be able to deplane as soon as the door opened. The reality was completely the other way around. The aircraft parked at the international gate section, so they decided not to open the front door (with aviobridge) but the the rear-end door instead. This was very ridiculous because we became the last pax to exit the aircraft and needed to wait so much unnecessary amount of time!

The people she and I spoke to were rude even when they knew her father had just died the day before. They said it was ""not their problem."" After a long and exhausting day of funeral arrangements, we were hung up on by the Avianca agent. We did not have the energy to call back that night since it was almost midnight. The next day my sister-in-law (her sister) called back to help. She was on the phone with Avianca for 2 plus hours. They again said not their problem. They didn't care that these two had just lost their father. Their callous attitude said it all. Finally we got somewhere after 2 hours and were told to send the death certificate. We sent the death certificate and got the flight changed, or so we thought. We got notice from Avianca that a death certificate wasn't enough since he died on a Wednesday and she wanted to fly back the following Wednesday.  Now Avianca wants the notice from the funeral home for what day the funeral was and a notice for when he was going to be cremated.  Finally after days of fighting with Avianca and endless painful paperwork sent, she was able to change her ticket. Of course she had to pay over $100. Not only did she have to pay that fee, her original flight was out of Cali, but she had to travel to Bogotá. Avianca refused to change her flight city, so after the most exhausting week of her life she now has to fly from Bogotá to Cali back to Bogotá to El Salvado to finally make it back to the US. Avianca refused to let her just go Bogotá to El Salvador. Why would they? They have proven how awful they truly are.  We will never use them again. You ca not treat people like this.

Similar to my previous experiences with Avianca, these were all excellent flights with a decent level of service. Avianca now use the Boeing 787 on the London-Bogota route, which is probably my favourite plane to fly long haul (not that the previous A330 was bad). The tinted windows, higher pressurisation, gentle lighting and more spacious cabin of the 787s make a big difference when you are on a 10+ hour flight. Avianca cabin crew were more friendly on this occasion than previously, and the IFE offering on the Boeing 787 was also very good. Only complaint about the long-haul legs is the food: on the way out the offerings weren't too bad, but the BOG-LHR return flight featured some of the worst airline food I've had in recent years. Domestic flights were very pleasant and all ran on time. Medellin airport is unfortunately quite far out of the city, but check-in was a breeze and the trip to Cartagena takes less than an hour. Decent inflight service, with free drinks, for such a short flight. Baggage reclaim in Cartagena was rapid. On my return flight from Santa Marta to Bogota (connecting to LHR), I arrived very early at Santa Marta airport (3 hours before my flight). The friendly check-in agent offered me a seat on an earlier flight to Bogota which saved me 2 hours of sitting in Santa Marta airport, where there is absolutely nothing to do. This also saved me having to worry about rushing a connection between terminals in Bogota, and gave me plenty of time to charge my electronics and find food at BOG before my international flight.

"""these people are idiots""",1,2016-11-27,"✅ Verified Review |  The return leg of this round trip (San Jose to Chicago) was to occur Saturday, November 26 at 5:40am. We arrived at San Jose at 3:40am. A representative of Avianca stopped us as we approached the check-in windows and informed us our flight was cancelled. She would not let us approach the ticket windows, saying no one there could help us reschedule. Instead she said we must call the customer service number. After a long time on hold I reached someone at this number who informed me that no one could help us reschedule until 5:30am when the office opened. I returned to the agent with this information but she refused to let us get help from a ticket agent. We returned to our hotel room and call the number at 5:29am. We were on hold for 45 minutes. When someone answered we were told that the customer center could not help us reschedule our flight, we must do this at the airport; the airport we had been turned away from at 4am. We returned to the airport and waited in a long line where only one agent working. We were then told that we could be on the flight on Tuesday morning - 3 days later. The airline refused to take any responsibility for our accommodations and would not find us passage on another airline because, according to them, the cancellation was weather related. I live in Costa Rica and this flight was for my daughter’s return to Chicago. We had “weathered” the non-hurricane in San Isidro de General and had driven from there to SJO on Friday under sunny skies. It was sunny skies in San Jose Friday when we arrived and clear skies Saturday morning when we went to the airport. On Saturday morning when our flight was cancelled other Avianca flights were traveling from SJO to San Salvador airport. In other words there was absolutely no weather issue in Costa Rica or San Salvador or in between. It was the smirks on the agent's faces when they told us there was nothing they would do to help us that was especially galling. The idiotic run around from the airport to the phone center to the airport wasted the time when we could used to make alternate arrangements. While we waited to learn what Avianca was going to do for us alternate ticket prices skyrocketed.

Seats were fine and flight attendants went our of their way to tell passengers if there were empty rows of 3 seats which was true on 2 flights.

When it came to a transfer and time, an attendant personally took my 4 items and stored them in the crew locker so I could get them quickly. I pressed the call buttons a total of three times and waited a total of one minute each time. The attendants on the El Salvador to New York run were quite busy assisting passengers to fill out immigration cards, etc. The seats were fine on the A330 but lacking support on the A320. There was seatback entertainment on all but the smaller jets. If you can take a rather exhausting 3 flight trip from Buenos Aires to New York, then Avianca is fine. I think the experience is rather first class in terms of service and personal care. The only complaint was that the captain announced almost nothing except to fasten seat belts when over turbulence, which was minor.

Avianca customer review,10,2015-03-04,Recently flew from San Francisco to El Salvador - then on to Panama and back to San Francisco. Was a bit concerned because some of the reviews were a bit iffy. However cant' say enough about this airline. Beats many of the US based airlines we fly regularly.

FA's attentive fair choice of food and beverages. SAP-RTB and RTB-SAL serviced by new ATR72's which are very quite and comfortable in comparison to the ancient ATR42's that used to service these routes.

Avianca customer review,5,2015-02-24,Flights AV121 from LHR-BOG and AV120 from BOG-LHR. We booked these overnight flights to make the most of our limited time in Colombia. However our outbound flight was delayed due to a technical fault and we were kept waiting at the gate until about 11.30pm when they finally decided that we wouldn't be leaving that night. The arrangements weren't very well communicated and we ended up standing outside the airport in the freezing cold waiting for buses to take us to the provided overnight hotel. We were also unable to retrieve our hold luggage (perhaps because the airport had mostly shut down by then) so had to manage with just what we had in our carry on luggage. We were initially told that the flight would leave at 12pm the next day but eventually it left at about 5pm - a delay of almost 19 hours. We were put on a replacement plane which was very new and reasonably comfortable (although our pre-booked seats were not honoured so we ended up on the back row of the cabin near the toilets). The main meal was pretty tasty actually and the cabin crew were reasonable polite. However once the meal service was over there was no sign of any cabin crew until breakfast the next day. On long haul flights with other airlines the cabin crew come through every so often with glasses of water or fruit juice to help keep hydrated so it was disappointing not to have that simple touch on this flight. The breakfast did include cereal with yoghurt though which I did like! Our return flight left on time thankfully and was back on the usual Star Alliance branded plane which didn't feel quite as new and shiny as the one we'd flown out on. Shortly after takeoff we entered some turbulence which lasted about 30 minutes - it would have been nice if the pilot had communicated this with us before take off like other airlines often do. There was in fact very little communication from the pilot (in Spanish or English). The inflight entertainment was reasonable but with only a limited selection of films. We landed back at LHR about an hour early but then had to wait because there was a technical problem getting our bags off the plane. All in all I was hopeful that this overnight service would be a useful way to get to Colombia but next time I think we'll fly indirect on a different airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,3,,,False
Avianca customer review,9,2015-02-18,Used Avianca for two trips (and a total of 6 flights) last month: Washington DC - San Salvador - Guatemala City (return) and Guatemala City - Flores return. Every flight left on time and arrived early. Food was served in economy class even on the internal flight that last 45 minutes and it was quite decent. Planes were brand new. Great inflight entertainment for economy class. The cabin crews were all very friendly and charming. Used the business lounges (with my Miles and More gold card) and they were fine.

Avianca customer review,5,2015-02-18,LHR-BOG-UIO in business class. I decided to fly with Avianca because of the price for the business class. I know their reputation so I didn't set my expectation too high. The flight overall was ok. There was a mechanical problem just minutes after the plane took off from LHR. The plane had to go back to check the landing gear. The plane looked tired and they didn't manage to clean up the cabin properly. The business class seat is really poor compared to the other airlines but I could still get good sleep. The FA were definitely not up to the international standard. The meal and IFE were poor overall with limited options. Would I recommend this airline? Probably not but if you can get good price and set your expectation low enough they are probably not a bad option.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,,False

Avianca customer review,3,2015-02-11,Today I flew with my two small kids from New York to Lima with a stopover in Bogota. Due to weather in the U.S. the flight was delayed but got in early enough for us to catch our connecting flight. But Avianca decided to use our delay as an excuse to already give our seats to other passengers as the flights was oversold. We were told that we had seats on the next flights 3 hours later but that was a lie. When boarding started I was waiting to handed my boarding passes but instead I was told that this flight was also full and I should wait for the next flight or could take a flight the next day. The staff were not only rude but did not seem to care much about the fact that I had 2 very small children with me. We afterwards found out from other passengers that this seemed to be a very common practice at Avianca. It seems their business strategy is clearly not based on customer service but rather on short term profit maximization.

Flight AV 9754 BOG-CTG was initially delayed 30 minutes but after boarding we had to wait another 2 hours before take off. It so happens that there was no purser! That only transpired later though as passengers were not informed at all of what was going on. Total contempt for passengers. Avianca does not have enough crew back up according to locals.

Avianca customer review,1,2014-12-19,Will never fly again. Flight delayed 2 hours from Flores - no explanation.

Avianca customer review,,2014-12-19,I will never fly Avianca to Central America again! I was flying with my one year old daughter from JFK to Guatemala and had a stop with a layover of 4 hours. As soon as I got off the plane I had to wait for them to give me my stroller for about 20 minutes. When I finally got my stroller the flight attendant informed me my flight was delayed by 3 more hours (bringing the total layover time to 7 hours! with a baby and with absolutely no explanation or reason for the delay). Once the time came for preparing to board there was not one employee from Avianca at the gate. No one to ask for info no one to ask what was going on. The time came for when we were actually supposed to be taking off and still no one and still no explanation as to why. Eventually an hour later we boarded. On the way back home I got to the check in and had to wait until the counter staff showed up 2 hours before the flight (again no explanation or apology). When I got to my stop in El Salvador they almost lost my stroller because they thought it was supposed to stay in El Salvador even though it clearly said on the tag to give it to me there and that I had to go to Newark. At El Salvador Avianca airport it was extremely chaotic (also no scanners for carry on so I almost lost my flight because it took so long with each person).,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,3,,,False

Avianca customer review,5,2014-12-01,"I use AV quite a lot for both International flights within Latin America as well as domestic flights. This comment refers to my last flight from Bogota to Barranquilla in Business Class. AV now uses El Dorado Terminal for many domestic flights (for the routes with highest traffic) which is convenient especially if you have to connect to international flights. The lounge has also improved but it is mostly very crowded. Long queues at the entrance. Outbound A318 inbound A320. Business Class seats spacious very nice compared to the European ""middle seat free"" concept. AVOD available also on domestic flights (even so in Y). These are the positive aspects. Now to the negative points: As mentioned before Lounge in BOG is always crowded lounge in BAY even worse in the evening it makes no sense to enter you don't find any space. F&B offering ok but always picked within 2 minutes. AV says they provide you with Food in the Lounge so they dont provide any food onboard not even in C Class. Not even a pack of peanuts! So when you don't find space in the Lounge you have to go and buy something because onboard you wont get anything! This is very poor for an airline that wants to present itself as the industry leader in Latin America! The crew is mostly nice and gentle and because of the nice seat I rate them 5/10 for the experience in domestic C Class. If it was European concept with middle seat free I would not even rate them 1/10 because apart from the mentioned negative points the ticket prices are very high for C Class.",False,,,Business Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,3,,,True

Dated and worn A330s (bad luck I guess as they have new ones) not lie-flat but seats comfortable enough to assure an average rest. While the outbound leg (AV10 Nov 3) featured a disinterested and rude crew and provided a below standard business class food and beverage offer the return early morning flight proved a great difference beginning with the greatly appointed Velazquez IB lounge in MAD with an expansive F&B and amenities offer which is a huge contrast with the substandard and rude AV lounge in BOG. Return AV 27 (Nov 8) offered a good early morning breakfast (almost a brunch) and then a fairly good lunch with a reasonable wine and spirits offer all of them served by a rather friendly crew. Arrival in BOG at 1pm avoids the rush and chaos of the tiny and third-world shaped EDR international terminal. I would fly them again when upgraded.

Avianca customer review,1,2014-09-17,I flew several various Avianca flights with friends through Peru and Ecuador in the past two and a half weeks and I am greatly dissatisfied with the airline in general particularly through Peru (Lima/Cuzco). The flights never left on-time and on-average left an hour and a half after the scheduled departure time. Due to connecting flights there was about a 15 minute grace period getting off one flight and going through customs immigration and then through security again to get to the next gate (flight crew did not provide instruction whether there was a way to skip all of these steps ahead of time). In addition on an early morning 3-hour flight a friend observed the entire flight crew napping in the back of the plane. I find this appalling.

Really disappointed about the development of Avianca - starting with their new ugly livery. The crew from Miami to Bogota were completely uninterested in attending to passengers after the meal was served. During the meal I asked for a wine and water. One attendant said: normally only one beverage is served per passenger! The cup of wine is tiny (half of a normal cup)! The food was a joke have never seen smaller portions on routes over 3 hours. 3 mini- strips of meat tasteless. No salt or pepper available on board. The airline is the only one I know with a Duty Free seller on board. I wanted to buy a whiskey but it was not available. This person was not friendly or enthusiastic at all. After arrival in Bogotá the crew did not say goodbye they were just packing their stuff. Who invented this terrible new seat? For small people maybe nice for tall people like me a disaster - the headrest hurts my neck. Seat pitch was better some years ago. The service on the domestic routes did not convince me either. They only serve bad coffee or artificial juices. The planes are new but not very well cleaned. Positive: All my flights were on time.

Best option in domestic flights but average or below average on International flights. Agree with some reviews: Stewardesses disappeared once the first meal was served they look like they don't enjoy the job one of them asked me in a rude way to put down the entertainment screen (while counterparts in domestic flights do this for you).

They told us that Avianca had everything under control and that the flight already knew about us and they would wait. We had about 40 minutes to get from one gate to the other so we were very calm. Avianca park the plane on the last spot of the airport so the commute (by bus) was very long and once we got there they told us the plane had gone.

There are no information screens anywhere in the airport and all announcements are garbled so that even Spanish speakers find it hard to understand. On the plus side there is free wifi so we were able to track Avianca's inbound flight - which was almost an hour late landing. The airport is just too small to cope with boarding two planes simultaneously - it was a nightmare! The crew did a good job of turning the aircraft quickly and we were boarded fairly quickly. Ignored by staff at the boarding door who were more interested in their own conversation - other crew much more proactive. Very new A320 new leather seats with excellent legroom and large TV with a range of AVOD TV programmes you can start watching straight away.

The plane was not so clean. Food service was okay. Stewardesses some friendly others not interested. English skills mediocre. Announcements hard to understand.

We boarded the plane and then after waiting over an hour with no communication we were told the flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues and we needed to get off. The Avianca staff then proceeded to have us wait at the baggage carousel for close to 5 hours with next to no communication no systems in place to deal with the various flight arrangements and accommodations and no food or water. People had been at the airport since 2am and we didn't get a shuttle to a hotel until 9.5 hours later with next to no proactive communication on their part.

Avianca customer review,3,2014-03-22,I flew 3 times during the last 3 weeks with Avianca. First from Sao Paulo to Salvador de Bahia. Check in at GRU was friendly and efficient. Getting to the departure gate was complicated the gate was changed twice and the final gate had another city and flight listed. All this may be the problem with GRU airport. The next was from Rio to Bogota. An International flight where a light breakfast was served about an hour after take off and then nothing not even water. You had to ask for water to the sullen stewardess at the back of the plane. It was a 6 hour flight. The flight today was from Bogota to Cartegena. Avianca has a dedicated terminal which was very busy but efficient. All 3 flights left between 20-30 minutes later than scheduled. The staff decidedly looked away when you were boarding probably anxious that you may ask a question. Other passengers were on my allocated seat on two flights and I had to engage with them whilst staff looked away. Perhaps it's the local way.

I could not go to the galley because of the sleeping passenger next to me I was really thirsty and a half full glass of water was brought to me in a rude way. Inflight entertainment often breaks down movie selection ok. Seat pitch really limited. Airbus relatively new but not really clean. The toilets were not cleaned during the flight. Flight attendants disappear for the most time of the 10 hour flight. For the relatively high ticket prices bad value for money compared e.g. to the star alliance partner LH. Domestic flights both on time but mediocre service. Very limited drink service on board (bad coffee - a shame of a Colombian airline) no snack served. Staff smiling but in my opinion it is a false friendliness. English announcements hard to understand English skills also in Bogota airport depending on the employee limited.

None however match Avianca in sheer mediocrity. Our issues began with their phone reservation system we made some changes that were never registered when we arrived to check in. Our flight connected through BOG but the check in person did not know whether or not our bags would go through. She said ""ask in BOG"". Ok. Our flight was 1 hour and 40 minutes late so we missed our connection. No one from Avianca was there to greet connecting passengers. No information. In customs we were told by one Avianca person to wait for the bags then another to go to the connecting flight area. We had three possible connecting times but their poor handling of passengers made us all miss them. Turns out the bags were not checked through but my wife found them an hour later in the carrousel. We spent the night in Bogota paid by Avianca and then proceeded the next day chaotic conditions throughout. Never again. All flights miss timetables but it's how the situation is handled where the good are separated from the bad. Avianca doesn't even make the ""bad"" category.

The staff were most professional and the service (not much as it was such a short flight) was more than adequate.

Never had to wait longer than 5-10 min. Ground crew as well as flight crew friendly and efficient. They give you the feeling that you are a guest and not just a pax. Decent on-board service on mainly brand-new airbus aircraft. The brand new ones have 'mood lightning' in the cabin which is very nice on night flights. Decent on-board service. Even on a 1hr-flight they serve a small snack and beverages for free incl. alcoholic drinks. Full meal on the 2hr flight UIO-LIM. Food quality is nothing fancy but it's ok. In theory they offer also a free in-seat entertainment system. However not all aircraft are equipped with it even not some brand new ones. On the 2 legs where it was existent it was out of order. Here is room to improve and provide the same standard at least on flights over 2 or 3 hrs. So if you need entertainment bring your own or a good book since you don't know what you get.

Pillows and blanket on each seat. Flight was full - drink run and dinner served. Food was good and watched movies and TV shows on their great entertainment system. FA's came around multiple times with water - and always friendly. Landed in BOG during a rainstorm - parked on the tarmac by the cargo area.

On all flights domestic and international the turn out of the crew has been exceptional immaculate uniforms and grooming - A sense of pride which is something that I see less of in European and American Airlines that I have flown with these last years. Only issue I have had was being turned out of the emergency exit seat on a domestic flight when the crew member briefing me on the emergency procedure for that row discovered I didn't speak Spanish. Since most the passengers did not speak English there was not much I could say really.

Both A320 had the personal TV screen which is not common on a less than 2hr flight and a good entertainment system (suffering some rebooting problems during the return flight). Tickets not very cheap though (USD 900 for two persons) but very close to the only two competitors available for this route (LAN and COPA).

Seat (1K) was comfortable enough but they should definitely have the option to lie flat for longer flights. Gave us amenity kits which contained L'Occitane products. One of the biggest selling points for Avianca is their Inflight Entertainment System. Served breakfast shortly after take off and it was rather good but afterwards flight attendants disappeared until one hour before landing.

My aisle seat was very comfortable and fortunately I brought my own entertainment for the flight because in-flight entertainment from Avianca is very basic. The worst was the service and the quality and quantity of the food. The stewards were never seen in the cabin except during the meal distribution. During the flight we got two small hot meals which were both poor in quality. I had much preferred a single but better quality hot meal and before the landing a small snack.

Again the crew cannot be nicer but their disregard for the basic concepts of business class service could be amusing if they did not include things such as not picking up glasses before landing and the way they serve meals.,False,,,Business Class,,,1,2,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,1,,,False
Avianca customer review,7,2012-11-16,BSB-GRU in A320. No thrills reasonable legroom good individual IFE system for a domestic route.

Avianca customer review,3,2012-11-15,Cali-Bogota-Barcelona. Disappointed by Avianca this time. Check-in at Cali airport chaotic extremely slow service and employee at counter robotic. Changed our previous pre-selected seats without comment. Cali-Bogota delayed 30 minutes arrival at Bogota at domestic Puente Aereo. 20 mins waiting time for bus transfer to international terminal. Fortunately we had 3.5 hrs connecting time less is too tight! Long queues at emigration. Plane Bogota-Barcelona full. New A330-200 but not very well maintained - seats and carpet had stains trash in seat pocket. Some staff friendly others were not and uninterested. No help placing handbags in the bins. Inflight service mediocre. Food quality bad (chicken was dry and rice tasteless) only plastic cutlery. Beverage service average. Poor headphone quality and also uncomfortable so it was not a great entertainment experience. Recommend to bring own headphones. After meal service crew disappeared drinks only upon request during the night. Very bad breakfast before landing served in a hurry 1 hour prior to land coffee was a shame for a Colombian airline. Seats uncomfortable for such a long flight. Entertainment box under the seat took me precious legroom. Staff at de-boarding tired and not so friendly. All in all average experience imagined service and comfort would be better.

Arrived to Bogotá Puente Aéreo is a chaos. Connecting flight on time. Long queue in emigration but not so annoying. Staff friendly on gate. Inflight service attentive and nice.

Avianca customer review,2,2012-08-28,We flew from Orlando to Rio de Janeiro with a change of planes in Bogota. In Orlando the business check in counter had no attendant so someone from the economy class came to assist us. We were also told that there was no business lounge in the terminal. Seats on the A319 did not recline and the food and beverage were of mediocre quality. We arrived in Bogota and the VIP business lounge was almost full. Very poor quality food being served and in the male toilets one was out of order and the other was filthy so I used the toilet outside the business lounge. The flight from Bogota to Rio was on the same kind of plane the A319: no decent reclining seats and the most annoying announcements that lasted all night long and did not allow you to sleep. They even woke us up in the middle of the night reminding us that you could not use mobile phones on the plane.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Avianca customer review,10,2012-08-01,GIG-GRU: It's a shame Avianca aren't more of a presence in the Brazilian market; for this short hop I paid just over £25 one week before travel - far less than TAM Gol Webjet and Azul were all offering - and this included a 25kg piece of hold luggage plus food/drink on a flight little over 40 minutes. Possibly the fastest check-in security and boarding I've experienced and a more generous amount of legroom than other carriers. We got an old Fokker 100 on this route which despite showing a few signs of its age was very comfortable and smooth throughout. The cabin crew were all smiley and pleasant and served everyone promptly and we were reunited with our baggage all of 10 minutes after getting off the plane. A flight this long usually isn't worth writing about but if you're travelling domestically in Brazil check them out!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Avianca customer review,10,2012-07-15,BCN-BOG: Great service in flight we left on time from Barcelona and arrived early to Bogota. The plane A330 was in immaculate condition.

Avianca customer review,10,2012-06-26,BOG-PTY-BOG. Out in C back in Y. I had never flown AV before but found the service and aircraft configuration to be far better than anticipated. In C the seat is comfortable and has an adjustable leg rest in addition to the recline - a feature usually found only on long haul aircraft. The IFE array in both cabins was extensive and included USB and power at every seat as well as video on demand. In Y the seats also had footrests. The service was excellent and the food was tasty. From my point of view quite an undiscovered gem.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Avianca customer review,10,2012-06-24,SSA-GRU: Excellent airline. New Airbus A-320 with a very good entertainment system for a 2.30 flight (individual screens).

It's a pity they're still small and lack of more options.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Avianca customer review,8,2012-05-27,Flew BOG-CTG-BOG-ADZ-BOG. Very reasonable fare considering the journey was booked the night before travel.

Avianca customer review,9,2012-05-22,I spend a lot of my time travelling on business in Colombia. Ecuador and Chile. I fly nearly exclusively Avianca and although the airline has its faults I think it provides an excellent balance of service and cost in particular when compared with US airlines flying in the region. Expect a lot of queue jumping and some confusion in particular at Bogota airport. The equipment they fly is up to date and if delays ensue one needs to take into account the prevailing weather conditions in the region. Inside the cabins are good and for the most part the inflight service fine - sometimes though you do run into 'lazy' crews. If there's one bad thing it's the food. In business it isn't 'C' class quality. Pricing is good as is the LIFEMILES program.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Avianca customer review,10,2012-05-09,Original itinerary CLO-LIM-EZE cancelled because of the weather conditions as Avianca Elite member I was given upgrade with a new itinerary CLO-BOG-EZE. Usual delays and dirty interiors at El Dorado Bogota but it is not the fault of the airline. Very nice business class section on board of A330. Seats are very comfortable and easily can be turned into almost flat bed. Big screens with a decent choice of recently aired movies. Welcome champagne is offered on boarding as well as amenities such as better-than-usual headphones. Colored menu is given with an interesting choice of meals. A number of cocktails offered with good wine as well. Food is tasteful and served beautifully. Shortly before arrival another meal is offered. Overall excellent.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Avianca customer review,,2012-04-24,Ticketed by Avianca to go Bogota-Mexico City connecting onto Aeromexico to Los Angeles. I had 2.5 hours to make connection in Mexico City. Physically not possible to arrive in Mexico City go through immigration get luggage clear customs change to the other terminal check-in for new flight in that amount of time. Flight left Bogota 45 mins late but then sat on the runway for 30 minutes. In Mexico City it took 90 minutes before any luggage arrived. Upon missing the connection they told me it was my fault they offered no compensation or accommodation in Mexico City and suggested I purchase a new ticket. Finally after 2 hours they agreed to issue me a new ticket. The flight itself was actually quite nice with a good meal and friendly service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Avianca customer review,5,2012-01-24,Four flight segments all in Y-class two pax senior age. MIA-BOG and BOG-SCL. We picked them because of convenient departure times out of MIA and due to a considerable price difference compared to LAN Chile. All 4 flights - domestic and international - were in almost new Airbus A320 and A330 planes thus impressively clean. Departure procedures at MIA and BOG international airports were chaotic the domestic terminal in BOG plus the terminals in Cartagena and Santa Marta are acceptable. Inflight service is ok for the domestic part - the service on international flights is probably the worst we have ever experienced. The only thing they care about is selling onboard duty free items. If you want to save money take Avianca into consideration their planes will still be pretty new in 2012 - if you want/need more quality and service you have to pay the higher fares of LAN!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,False
Avianca customer review,6,2011-12-16,There is actually one flight with decent business seats from BOG to JFK that's AV 20/21 which uses an A330. Very comfortable angled lie flats with comfy blankets and pillows. The flight north is a late overnight so food is not a big issue. The flight south leaves early in the morning - make sure to eat something in the lounge because both breakfast and snack are up there with the worst food I have ever tasted on a plane.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Avianca customer review,5,2011-11-30,BUE-PTY. Arrived at Buenos Aires 5.30am for 7.30am flight and the line was unbelievable. Told by customer services that the flight was delayed so not to worry about a 1 hour wait. When I started to ask her about our connection being effected in Bogota she walked off saying she can't help. We went back 30 mins later and there was no one helping out and only 2/3 desks open operating very inefficiently. The flight did leave late and it took about an hour to dump our bags without any information but once onboard it was good new seats AVOD etc and the change over in Bogota was fine. FA's hopeless. I think it's worth paying extra for reliability.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Avianca customer review,5,2011-11-28,BOG-JFK in business class. Continue to use A320 on long haul routes which are flights of 6 hrs or more. Business class seats on A320 are only adequate for a 3 hour flight because there is almost no recline or pitch space. Food is the worst thing 8 out of 10 dishes come with corn bell peppers and inedible sauces. Planes are new and staff do their job with a smile. Usually there are many delays in Bogota airport due to delays from domestic destinations so I would not recommend for connections. None of the airlines that fly from Bogota to US offer decent business class seats.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Avianca customer review,9,2011-09-07,IAD-BOG-GRU. There was bad weather in WAS so we missed our flight from BOG-GRU. They are not required to give you anything except a flight to your destination in the case of an impossible connection. This being said is they paid for everything 3 meals and a four star hotel. Their planes are nice the service alright. They are a little slow in the way they get things done but other than their organization no bad comments tickets are cheap don't expect the best luxury in Economy but you get a good deal.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Avianca customer review,7,2011-09-03,BOG-CLO in coach. New A318 with an exit row seat with the seat removed in front of me. Seat felt narrow but excellent legroom.

Avianca customer review,6,2011-08-10,BOG-BCN-MAD-BOG with my two kids. A330-200 very modern great entertainment system. Seats in Economy are terrible for long-haul and the food was very poor. They were cheap tickets though.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,False
Avianca customer review,1,2011-08-04,LIM-BOG-MIA round-trip. Service was poor crew members did not smile during the flight just when leaving the plane. Food was not up to standard. We passed security in Lima with no problems once we arrived in Bogota we passed another security point even when we are on international connecting flights and another one once you are called to the waiting room in addition they called my name to let me know I needed to open my luggage for a random inspection. When I went with my keys they could not find the luggage. On the plane I tried to watch a movie but even with full volume on my speakerphones I could still hear the plane engines. I saw a bottle of 7-up in beverage/food cart and asked for that FA said that they did not have any but just coke or apple juice without apologies.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Avianca customer review,10,2011-06-30,"Excellent airline. I flew with them between Bogota-Caracas-Quito-Bogota. Efficient and helpful staff. We were on a rather tight connection in Bogota-Quito and the queue for the security x ray machine etc. was such that we would miss the flight. I approached a passing lady wearing an Avianca uniform and explained our predicament within seconds a military lady with rather large gun ran up to us screamed ""Quito"" and gestured us to follow her. We were whisked to the head of the security queue and escorted to the gate where the ground crew were anxiously scanning for us and on to the flight.

Avianca customer review,8,2011-05-03,ZRH-MAD-BOG-CLO on A330-200. Madrid to Bogota was very pleasant good ground staff accommodated my last minute seat change request. Friendly cabin crew plane in great condition with in-seat entertainment system. Compared to competitors (Air France Iberia) you get great value for money. Only negative the meal was rather disappointing quality and quantity wise.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Avianca customer review,7,2011-04-24,MIA-BOG-EZE on new A330 clean and in excellent condition. Check it at MIA quick and efficient and priority access through security. Lounge in MIA was America's club which was very basic but staff friendly. Very friendly Cabin Crew offering Champagne and menus prior to departure. Meal service was quick and efficient - basic for business class but good. Meal on BOG-EZE less substantial than the 3 hour from MIA which I didn't understand and I've received much better quality and quantity of meals when flying Singapore Airlines economy. The seat on the A330 is difficult to sleep I'm 6'1 and I kept sliding down which made it hard to get comfortable. I found Avianca great value for money - considering its a new product and the US airlines business class on the same legs are old and tired.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Avianca customer review,2,2011-04-12,BOG-SCL-BOG. Avianca's new business class is bad. I used to be a fan of Avianca. It's usually a reliable airline but it's new business class is a mess. On short haul (if you can call a 6 hour flight from Bogota to NYC or Santiago short haul) seat comfort is terrible: almost zero recline and ridiculous pitch between rows. On long haul (A330) they just installed new angled seats which are terrible to sleep on. So if you go to Europe chose Iberia instead (fully flat) and within region LAN remains unbeatable in comfort and service. In Avianca the food service is also mediocre and the wine choice (Trio and Trivento - both very average) is the same for 24 months now. The only good elements are IFE on demand and the flight attendants who are friendly. Boarding in Bogota is a mess (no priority lanes) and lounge is also mediocre without enough seats on peak periods.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Avianca customer review,3,2011-03-14,JFK-MED-BOG-JFK Avianca business class is taking a rapid nose dive. It's not just that food is getting worse (the new menu to NYC is basically inedible) you can't get a glass of wine on domestic routes (free rum and whiskey only) the uncomfortable A320 turns up on more and more NYC routes and the lounges are stuffy and overcrowded. The most disappointing part of the service is that Avianca makes absolutely no effort to ease the way for premium passengers through the deplorable Colombian airports. There are no dedicated security lines no fast track through immigration (which can take up to two hours in BOG on bad days) and when you finally make it to the plane there is no priority boarding. Obviously equal misery for all is a well tested concept - it's called the discount airline. That seems to be where Avianca is headed - surely with its present state of service there is no way to mistake it for the serious world class airline it wants to be. The only reason I keep recommending Avianca is because Delta Continental and American are hardly attractive alternatives. But if LAN ever opened a route between NY and Colombia.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,,True
Avianca customer review,5,2011-03-14,BOG-JFK return business. Most of the time Avianca uses A319/320 in this route. These planes have a terrible business class seat with limited recline. They are good for a 2 hour flight but not for a long flight such as BOG-JFK (aprox 6 hours). If you are lucky to fly 767 or the new A330 in this route you will have a good service from Avianca but not in these smaller planes. AVOD has a decent choice and food service was OK (although I think that travellers would prefer a breakfast before arrival at 6am than a dinner at departure time on mid-night). It's sad to see Avianca placing a bet on this seat configuration for long routes such as Santiago or JFK since comfort level is substandard.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Avianca customer review,8,2011-02-24,Miami-Bogota-Guayaqui-Bogota-Fort Lauderdale. With the exception of BOG-GYE on a Fokker100 all segments on a new A320. Good legroom and large individual touch-screen entertainment- including a nice pillow blanket and quality head-seats. A small but tasty meal is served with colombian coffee and good-quality whisky. All free of charge! Female flight attendants are courteous and attentive but their male counterparts can be less so. One downside not Avianca's fault is the international wing at Bogota's Eldorado airport. Completely uninspiring not providing even an intercom system. Flights are called by the gate agents in loud voices as if we were in a bus station. However major construction is already underway and it should improve considerably the experience for the connecting passenger. All is all this is one of my favourite airlines when flying to South America. Not top-notch but above average at competitive prices.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Avianca customer review,5,2011-01-09,JFK-BOG-MDE. Overnight flight from JFK on A319. Ground staff efficient and did a good job of trying to control excessive luggage. Still overhead bin room ran out fast with arguments ensuing. Onboard service fairly dismal - a small cold wrap offered by a mostly unfriendly and uninterested crewe xcept one young FA. Cabin felt excessively hot and uncomfortable. Seats fitted with PTVs but uncomfortable. Only water round was before landing on a 5 hour flight - not even OJ offered. Connection in BOG at dawn was fairly easy. Domestic flight was on an A320 fine legroom for a short segment. A drink offered. Crew seemed much more professional and interested in doing their job than the ones on international flights.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False

Avianca customer review,2,2011-01-02,BOG-MED-BOG in economy class. Flights late both ways with no explanation. No announcements in English only Spanish so you just have to follow the crowd.

Avianca customer review,9,2010-12-12,MAD-BOG in A330 with the family. Very attentive FAs serving in a very friendly way. Quiet and comfortable cabin lie flat seats with slight angle but comfortable for seating and sleeping. Good AVOD with nice selection.

Nice little details like typical Colombian flowers accompanying the dinner and Colombian coffee as farewell present.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Avianca customer review,5,2010-12-01,LAX-BOG-MDE return in Economy. Seating very tight and food inferior on both the long legs. On the return MDE-BOG we were mingled in with passengers coming in from Madrid to Medellin and it was quite chaotic getting back into the domestic group in Bogota as I was staying a day there. I felt there had been a serious decline in passenger service in the last 12 months even allowing that when I did the same trip a year ago it was in Business. But the check-in staff at LAX were very friendly more-so than in Bogota. Too little English spoken inflight and I think the non-Spanish speaking passengers get a pretty raw deal.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Avianca customer review,,2010-11-03,Had my flight scheduled for night of Nov 1st from Bogota to New York. They let all passengers check-in process through security and to the waiting room. Flight was scheduled for 11pm. At 1130pm when all passengers are seated waiting for boarding they announce Flight cancelled (Delayed according to them). We have to leave and come back at 5am. They keep the bags. They seem to have joined to flights since new faces showed up at the 0715 flight. We confirmed with them that since it is another plane are bags will make it to JFK on the same plane with us and 3 staff members say YES to this. We arrive at JFK and and on baggage claim there is one lady from Avianca. She announces that over 100 bags were left in Bogota and they do not know when they will come. The plane in which we came was smaller and could not handle all the luggage. Bottom line is we are getting a run around on the bags and nobody knows when and if I might get them. Never again with them.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,,False

Avianca customer review,10,2010-07-31,Avianca was my choice on my last trip to Washington with an 1 hour connection in Bogota. Nice planes (A330/A320) good flight attendants IFE. On the way back to Lima a storm stopped all operations at IAD. The flight attendants were courteous and polite with passengers serving drinks all the time we stood stranded. On arrival at Bogota Avianca quickly rebooked all of us on other flight to Lima the following day.

Avianca customer review,5,2010-06-21,BOG-GYE-BOG operated by Avianca’s SAM subsidiary although you would never know apart from reading that fact from the small notice printed on the side of the aircraft and the aircraft a Fokker 100 the entire fleet of which in Avianca colours are operated by SAM. However for all intents and purposes this is an Avianca service and after check-in I went to the Avianca Business Class Lounge at Bogota. This Lounge proudly advertises the fact that it has won awards for the best Business Class Lounge in Latin America – it’s difficult to understand why as it is large very impersonal and depressing and has the absolute minimum of food choice. It seems that when the Fokker 100s are used on international services they are parked off-gate on a remote stand which means the dreaded bus. Business Class comprises a cramped 2 rows of 2x2. The hot meal service started about 1 hr into this 1.5 hr flight. Even then service was slow and by the time this service reached Row 2 where I was sat we were well into the descent and the service was withdrawn. The return service was much better but the on-time arrival benefit was lost whilst we awaited a tug to push us back onto the remote stand and then another delay waiting for the bus. Meanwhile another two international flights had arrived and a huge line awaited us in the Immigration Hall.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True

Avianca customer review,1,2010-05-13,Recently in J class BCN to MED connecting through BOG. The transatlantic leg pleasant. The connection through BOG a total disaster. Tight to begin with and even tighter after a delayed departure. Nobody to meet transit passengers at the gate (J class plus highest elite status apparently not worth any extra attention). On own initiative despite an endless line I still made it through immigration with half an hour to spare plenty of time to make it to connecting plane. But no transfer desk looked aghast at my early appearance and stood firm that all domestic transfers had been closed. Overnight in Bogota but oops all of Bogota sold out except the downtown Tequendama which I don't wish on my worst enemy. That's where this airline despite major improvements over the last couple of years still allows bureaucracy to kill customer service initiative. Had there been an agent to take us through immigration and put us into a car to our connecting plane AV would have made friends for life. (And saved a bunch of money.) Which by the way wouldn't be a bad move after having drastically cut the benefits for their top frequent fliers.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
