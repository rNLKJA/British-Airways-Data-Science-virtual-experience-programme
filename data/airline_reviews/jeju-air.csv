"""I will definitely recommend""",8,2020-02-12,"Clark to Seoul. Smooth flight on Jeju Air and I am impressed. I had to think twice on booking because Jeju Air has a bad review and most of its customers were left unhappy and unsatisfied on their flight. So we took the risk and booked. On the flight day we are  expecting to pay for our baggage as the website says our ticket doesnt have a free baggage allowance. Usually, LCCs allow their passengers one check in baggage per person. But in the airport, we were three. The check in agent checked our bags for free - 5 pieces!  The flight was very smooth. Though the attendants were not always present on the cabin. They just served the free water before landing. I will definitely recommend.",True,Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Clark to Seoul,February 2020,4,5,,5,4,,True,

At the counter, I asked about how the policy is different from what we saw on the official website, they just ask us to pay no explanation.

The seats were a bit cramped with my knees touching the back of the seat in front (I’m 6ft tall so nothing particularly new on an LCC flight).

"""disappointed in the customer service""",1,2019-06-04,"My family and I recently flew Jeju Air from Seoul to Osaka on Tuesday May 7. I was incredibly disappointed in the customer service that was provided to us at the check-in counter. We were five adults traveling from the United States, with five check-in luggage. After she weighed all our suitcases, she said that we were 6 kg total overweight. By then, she had already put all our luggage on the conveyor belt, and they all had left the counter, then asked us to pay 60,000 krw. None of us even had any carry-on baggage, and could have easily taken out our duffle bags to carry 1 measly kg each. We had no choice but to pay the fee, when she had multiple ways to handle the situation. When we boarded the plane, I saw everyone with 2-3 carry-ons each all stuffed together to look like 2. I was incredibly upset by the unfairness of our treatment. I tried to contact the airline and they asked us for more details of our flight, then ignored me. I point out that the tray table on one of our aisle seats was broken. They are a ""budget"" airline for a reason. Oh, other minor things, they didn't even offer us water, you had to ask for it.

We only used 1 big piece luggage and a back pack for easier travel since we have senior citizens with us. Our big luggage exceeded 5kgs and they insisted that we separate it so we obliged. But here's whats unfair, when we got to our gate waiting to board, the ground attendant approached us and said that the plane's overhead bin was a bit small for our hand carry bags (2 standard cabin baggage size with less than 4kgs in weight) and asked us that we check-in the bags instead. Since we saw a lot of bags already tagged for check in, so we said yes ok, maybe it really wont fit (so, we thought!), but when we got on the plane all their local citizens had their hand carries with them, bigger than our bags putting it in the overhead bin!
