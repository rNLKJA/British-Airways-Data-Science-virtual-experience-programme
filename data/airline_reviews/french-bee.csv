Arriving at the check-in kiosks more than 90 minutes before departure, it would not let me check in there either. Confused, I walked towards the check in counters with clerks, and met two groups of people who where having a back and forth with the clerks about not being able to get on the LA flight, as they were abruptly rolling down the shutters and closing the baggage belts.  I was confused. I knew I was there in great time. There was no way I could have missed this flight? Knowing what I was going to hear, I waited my turn and said I was there to check in for the LA flight. I was rudely pointed towards the customer service desk and told that I needed to book another flight. I looked towards the other groups of people and one guy said they were all equally confused. We walked over to the customer service desk together and met around 5/6 other people who had encountered the same situation. As we waited in line for help, more and more people who were supposed to be on the LA flight started to show up. Frustrated but unsurprised, the customer service representatives were incredibly rude, unhelpful and entitled. My options were, pay $400 + for a flight to San Francisco later that day and make my own way to LA from there, or pay $400 for a flight to LA the next day, and book a hotel in Paris for the night. Apparently check in closes exactly 90 minutes before departure. This wasn't made clear to me when booking, and clearly to the 20+ other people who were in the same boat as me. There was no one around and they easily could have checked us in. Aside from this, I was at the check-in desks more than 90 minutes before departure and I had previously tried to check in online! They wouldn't hear any of it. They wouldn't let me talk or explain the situation. The agents were the opposite of calm, and turned to shouting at and fighting with customers instead. I was absolutely flabbergasted. So I ended up sitting outside the airport like a bloody fool while my flight hadn't departed. There is no doubt that we all could have very easily got on that flight. I guess they make their money through having people pay for multiple flights though. There is always a catch with these low cost airlines. One guy had the exact same thing happen to him two days in a row, so he had to book three flights through them just to get back to LA. The lady ""helping him"" simply mocked him and went off when he mentioned her customer service skills. So all in all, I ended up paying more than double the price of what I originally paid.

Our first bad experience was the inability to add checked bags on their website. We spoke to their customer service line and were told that they couldn't add it on for us and that we should use the website 24 hours prior to boarding our flight. When we tried to do this, we were met with the same message that said we could not add checked bags on the website. When we got to the terminal to get our boarding passes and add our bags through them, they charged us $95 per bag. Once we got to our gate, we waited far longer than the time that stated when we would take off, which was 8:30 p.m. We did not take off until 11:45 p.m. and were told that it was due to an immigration issue involving other passengers. There was no technical difficulty nor was there any inclement weather preventing an on time take off. According to regulation (EC) 261/2004, any delay over 3 hours at a distance over 3500 km would entitle us to compensation of 300 euro. Two days after we'd arrived in Paris, we received a call saying that our flight back home was rescheduled from the original date of June 6th 2018 to June 8th and that we needed to confirm that we would take that flight or opt for returning 7 days early or 7 days later. Either option would cost hundreds as last minute hotel reservations in paris were not cheap. From May 23rd until June 7th, I was repeatedly calling the customer service line and getting answers like ""we can't help with compensation"", ""We need to speak with our superiors and call you back"" (Which they never attempted to call back). We went back and fourth with no answer as to what we would receive in terms of compensation for our two extra days of stay as well as our extreme delay. Finally, I suggested asking their superiors about the possibility of refunding the full value of our ticket and canceling our return flight and I could purchase another ticket through a different airline. I was explicitly clear with them, even asking them to put into their notes and repeat back what they had written, to call me back in order to confirm that this is still something we wanted to do. After receiving no word for 3 days, I called them back and learned that they had canceled our flight without any confirmation from me. I attempted to have them rebook my fiancee and I on the June 8th flight, only to be met with ""I'm sorry but we can't rebook your flight"". Again, we had to repeatedly call multiple times a day, every day in order to get a straight answer as to what our options were. Finally, on June 7th, we were told that it would be impossible to rebook and that we would need to purchase another ticket back to the United States, even though we had not (AND STILL HAVEN'T) received the refund they told us was released to us for the original ticket that they had mistakenly canceled. Since returning, I had been trying to claim the compensation that had supposedly been approved. However, without a valid booking reference, the sight would not allow me to do so. This was the worst experience we ever had with a company. The representatives did not care to help, were not competent in their own jobs, were blatantly lying to us and doing everything possible to refuse the help we were asking for.
