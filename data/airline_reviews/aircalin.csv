"""Absolute rubbish service""",3,2022-11-12,"Absolute rubbish service today at the start and the end. Check in line for economy was huge. I had a Qantas ticket (codeshare) and am Platinum with Qantas so attempted to use the premium queue, which was not permitted. Despite not having clients, premium Check-in desks were not servicing economy clients, preferring to chat amongst themselves. Flight was ok. On arrival, no carousel information and bags took over 30 mins to commence delivery. A PA on ‘we’re sorry for late delivery and miss communication’ really doesn’t equate to being a reasonable service.

Service was good and cabin crew were pleasant. On the return journey from Noumea checkin was very slow and took far too long. Breakfast was served on this flight and it was terrible. It consisted of a grey omelette which looked so unappetisng no one around me ate it. Also served was a bread roll and croissant which were fine.

After lunch was cleared, the crew came through offering duty free and a digestif (cognac). Champagne available for purchase. Used my tablet to connect to inflight wifi streaming entertainment as no PTVs fitted on A320 (only redeeming feature of Air NZ). Wifi worked perfectly.

Aircalin customer review,8,2014-02-12,Sydney - Noumea. Didn't know what to expect from this smaller airline. Was a full flight with school holidays over. Staff at the gate were a combination of Qantas and Air Calin crew. Aircraft was a modern A330. Helps to have a small understanding of French because the crew will address you in French first. Really impressed by meal service. A full tray with salad bread main and dessert. Landing in Noumea on second attempt due to a go-around but crew were very professional throughout the flight. Entertainment system only covered a limited selection in comparison to other carriers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,,True
Aircalin customer review,9,2014-01-10,We travelled to Noumea on this airline-code share with Qantas on the outgoing leg and AirCailin on the return leg. The outgoing trip with Qantas was so sub-standard. With Qantas there was no entertainment we could see only two screens out of 5 visible in our section of the cabin and the meal served was inedible! However to my surprise the service was fantastic! The food was not only edible but enjoyable the service was swift polite and plentiful-the brandy at the end of the meal was a lovely touch. Individual screen for movies was also much appreciated. I would have no hesitation in flying this airline again or recommending it to friends.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,,True

Aircalin customer review,9,2013-01-28,Brisbane - New Caledonia - Tahiti. First leg was in a bright clean new A330. Business cabin only half full. My e-ticket had said “cold meal” but I was served a full hot dinner with quality French wines for just a 2 hour flight. IFE was adequate but surprisingly had no classical music. Flight was 50 min late departing because of late arrival of the aircraft which I suspect was due ongoing issues at Brisbane airport. The fairly new international airport for New Caledonia was bright and welcoming. The business lounge was small but modern. Excellent canapés and miniature cremes brulées. The flight for the second leg was operated by Air Tahiti Nui. This was not a codeshare as Air Tahiti Nui do not offer the flight themselves. A bright clean new A340. I was served a full hot lunch with quality French wines. IFE was satisfactory by modern standards.

Aircalin customer review,2,2008-05-12,SYD-NOU return. What a disappointment-after reading some of the good reviews I was looking forward to the trip. The check in at SYD was a disaster-4 economy desks with only one manned until they could find one more as the economy queue got longer and longer Also the outward journey was delayed by 45 minutes with little explanation . Once onboard the cabin crew were condescending if you spoke no French and the food was stale. The PTV was ok on the A330 but I returned on the A320 which only had limited audio. This flight was also late. There was hardly any legroom and to top it all off the bags didn't arrive at the carousel until at least 40 minutes later.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False

Aircalin customer review,,2007-05-21,The planes are quite new A320 & 330 roomy and comfortable featuring blue lagoon (fishes) seats. Nice PTVs (reliable and good quality screen and content) in A330. A320 have footrests adjustable headrest and good pitch even in economy. Hibuscus business class seats on 320 & 330 are very good especially for 2 or 3 hours flights. Meals are good even on short flights (NOU-BNE 1:35) you have a hot meal with choice of 2 dishes if the flight is on lunch or dinner time if not a snack or breakfast. On medium (PPT) to long haul flight (NRT & KIX) you have two meals. Wines champagne in business class liqueur after meals and aperitif. Overall good FA although it can really depend : there are better and worse FA. The check-in is usually efficient excepted during christmas holidays : additional flights and Noumea Tontouta's 12 check- in counters are not enough for 3 flight nearly at the same time. Boarding is quick and flight rarely late.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False

Aircalin customer review,,2005-08-30,NOU-NRT return. Almost new Airbus A330 good flight entertainment system but the crew wasn't nice and seem to be inexperienced and not very conscious about safety (customers walking in the cabin while the seatbelt sign was on). The meals were similar to low cost airlines and choice of drinks was also very poor. I wish I had the choice of another airlines between Noumea and Tokyo but unfortunately Air Calin is the only one on this destination.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Aircalin customer review,,2004-12-02,Brisbane-Noumea-Brisbane. The legroom on the A320 was great. The cabin service was ok. The entertainment program on both legs was very ordinary and the food abysmal - I am sure that the sandwiches and cake for the Sunday flight were prepared on Friday - they were extremely dry and the cucumber in the sandwiches had dried out and pickled itself. We did see a menu left behind from the previous segment from Auckland - it looked much better. The quality of food and entertainment really let the airline down.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Aircalin customer review,,2004-09-05,As a regular traveller throughout the Pacific for over 30 years I have found the Aircalin services especially good. The check in service is excellent and friendly the staff helpful for those who don't speak French. The menus are always a surprise with generous meals and drinks presented in immaculate style. Their new planes are first class in comparison with the Qantas 767 Sunday afternoon flight from Noumea to Sydney where old planes (200 series) and grumpy staff generally bring you back to earth with all of the finesse of a smack in the face.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False

Aircalin customer review,,2004-04-24,"Air Calin AKL-NOU (originally also NOU-AKL as well - but they decided to go on strike). Apart from boarding the aircraft (a beautiful A330) and waiting around an hour for who knows what reason as all passengers were seated and ready for some tropical sunshine and French culture which awaited us 3 hours away it was a pleasant and well done flight. My Kosher meal was bought to me before take off so I could ""break the seal"" and it could be heated up for me - the meal was nice but lacked presentation and creativity of everyone elses meals - which looked and smelt divine. The FA's all very well groomed and with mediocre manors were to some extent inhibited with their english skills which were good but just hidden behind shyness. The seats were very comfortable excellent PTV entertainment with each movie in four languages and at least 6 options + games - too much for a less than 3 hour flight. The inflight mag was also good but there wasn't much in the way of newspapers. Very scenic approach to Noumea - however I was a bit concerned about one of the stewardess' continuing a conversation with a passenger she obviously knew for half the flight (not actually doing any thing else after the meal was served) and continuing it until about 20 seconds to touch down - way after the announcement had been made to be seated. Tantouta airport is not made to handle a full A330 on a summer day it felt like there was no air con and the lines were horrendous - made worse with another wait for our bags. Customs was very relaxed though...as was any laws regarding smoking. Coming home was a bit of a feat. We turned up at the airport at 5 am after being told that there was only one previously delayed flight going to AKL due to a flight attendant strike or something along those lines. We were put up in a rat hotel by the airport by Air Calin until 1am in the morning when we were all shuttled back to the airport to check in etc (more lines) and a few hours later find out that our rescue ride home hadn't even left NZ yet - more waiting in one of the least entertaining airports in the world. Finally our air NZ plane arrived (on which my boarding pass was labelled with KSML yet did I get one - pity as I was looking forward to the far more entertaining Air Calin to carry me home and end my French Fling in my favourite holiday destination with a French Flair and decent service!",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Aircalin customer review,,2004-02-12,I recently travelled Aircalin BNE-NOU-BNE in economy class and cannot report with the same enthusiasm as other reviewers. The meal out of BNE was served immediately upon take-off and fell well short of the 'French-style cuisine' advertised on Aircalin's website consisting of a stale bread roll 4 slices of cold meat and a bland lettuce salad. The seat pitch in economy was reasonable and the PTV's on the A320 offered a good range of options including movies games and destination info. FA's were efficient though it was obvious that French-speaking passengers were receiving preferential service. The return flight was delayed by 2 hours due to the crew needing a rest (bad scheduling?). Meal on the return flight on the smaller 737 was better again served immediately upon takeoff. FA's were not to be seen for the rest of the flight once the meal service was over. No PTV's on the 737 and the entertainment on the main screens was only in French with no subtitles. Generally the experience was very average and I would not be in a hurry to fly Aircalin again.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False

I was extremely surprised by the quality of service provided onboard and on the ground. I flew their Hibiscus Business class PPT to NOU then coach and I have to say that Aircalin beats several major airlines I have travelled with during the last few years. The plane used was a brand new A 330 aircraft and once onboard you can expect to be greeted with warm and friendly smiles from the flight attendants. The food was plentiful and varied. The entertainment system was tip top. All in all for very long flights a generally pleasant experience would definitely consider flying Aircalin again.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
