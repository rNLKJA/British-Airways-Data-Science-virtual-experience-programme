"""I'm still trying to get a refund""",1,2021-12-06,Do not book with them! Couldn't travel due to COVID last year and I'm still trying to get a refund. I got an email in July saying there's a delay in getting refunds out and then I sent two more emails in October with absolutely no response to either. It's December and I'm still trying to reach them. Don't do it. It's not worth it. I'm out over $600 for an unused ticket.,True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Miami to Georgetown,",December 2021,,,,,1,,False,

"""the worst flight experience""",1,2021-07-24,"This airline doesn't have any planes, so it's existing only virtually by selling tickets on charter planes. Some sort of travel agency.

Updates on flight status were almost non-existent, and there is nothing to do at the Paramaribo airport. Staff was highly disorganized. I had booked a continuing flight with six hours to spare, figuring that was plenty of time. The delay cost me $440 to re-book my continuing flight, and the claims department has been non-responsive.

"""No further action was taken""",1,2018-11-13,"Surinam Airways cheated me by 250$, unwilling to refund a Flex ticket. I flew with Suriname Airways for the first and last time in September 2018 from Amsterdam to Paramaribo. Later I cancelled my Flex ticket for 11th October from Paramaribo to Port-of-Spain on Sep 07 2018 (9 weeks ago) because my schedule changed. The cancellation was in time and acknowledged by the customer service via e-mail. First Suriname Airways wanted to charge 40$ for the cancellation. Only after I reminded the staff that the Flex rate explicitly said ""cancellation free"" they agreed on refunding the whole price. Since then, for more than 5 weeks now I have been continuously asking about the processing of the case. The answer by the customer service is always: ""we redirected your request to the financial department"". No further action was taken beyond these words. It is obvious that Suriname Airways wants to postpone and will apparently never pay me back. I can only warn against booking flights with this Airline. It seems like they are not able to manage the most basic needs an Airline should provide its customers such as consistent information or customer service. It seems to me that the flights themselves are acceptable, if everything goes smooth. Seats, on-board service are alright. But if unexpected difficulties pop up, like delay or cancellation, expect Suriname Airways not being able to handle the situation or even to take advantage out of it - as in my case. Thus my advice would be: Stay away from Suriname Airways!",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paramaribo to Port-of-Spain,September 2018,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",1,1,,False,

Approached management and told it was my fault in not allowing 2 hours for getting thru customs. Told him that is incorrect as there was a 2 hour layover but they were an hour late!

Surinam Airways customer review,3,2015-02-18,Just came up with them from Para to Aruba with an onward connection on Copa to Panama and Colombia. They had an inflight emergency and went back to Para. After a leisurely aircraft switch we left again now almost three hours late and my connection in Aruba was gone. The airline took no responsibility whatsoever for the missed connection not even to the point of offering a wifi space to make it a little easier to sort out options. Their only offer was to fly me back to Surinam. Faced with this prospect I bought a whole new ticket for an evening flight on Avianca which made for a pretty expensive trip. Their C class seats are pretty comfortable. Their catering was minimal.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Surinam Airways customer review,9,2014-09-19,Flew SLM in July. We had a 15 minutes departure delay (Suriname - Aruba) but arrived surprisingly 20 minutes ahead of scheduled arrival time in Aruba.

Surinam Airways customer review,7,2014-04-06,GEO-PBM on 3/29/2014 - 737-300 flight was only 45 minutes but was fine. Seats a bit hard but had 3 seats to myself so was fine to stretch out. Flight attendants very nice - flight had originated in Miami and there were many people already on board when I boarded. Drink service was quick and flight smooth. A nice little airline - only thing that is a pain is that you still have to reconfirm your flight 72 hours in advance. And you have to call the airline office in the city you are departing from - not just any city office. When you were able to get the right phone number the person was very friendly and helpful I will say. Enjoyed my trip.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,

My sole complaint will be about ground staff they can be grumpy and surly at times. Would fly them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Surinam Airways customer review,3,2012-10-24,I have traveled Surinam Airways 3 times and none of those times we departed on time. The service on board is good though and they serve a hot meal at least. I fly most of the time from Aruba to Miami but instead of leaving at 11 am we departed 8pm! The other day supposed to leave Miami around 3.30 pm instead we left around 1 am. We spent 13 hours at Miami international they provided us with a 10$ voucher for food. Unacceptable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,

Surinam Airways customer review,10,2011-07-22,Flew Miami to Aruba. Check in was very quick with no queuing despite the flight being full. Aircraft was a 737-300. Crew friendly and efficient. A hot light meal was served in Economy Class along with two drinks services. No charge for meals or drinks. Surinam newspapers handed out during the flight. The flight left on time and arrived early.

Surinam Airways customer review,4,2010-12-14,Miami to Aruba for a weekend getaway. Fare was much cheaper than American Airlines. B737-300 was in good shape. The crew was friendly and professional. Contrary to AA Surinam Airways serves a light hot meal each-way with free surinamese beer. Both segments on-time. The only draw-back is that they only operate on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays.

Surinam Airways customer review,,2005-10-01,Just like Rogier's experience only in January 2003 - broken-down plane on flight from Cayenne to Paramaribo meant that my partner and I experienced a significant delay (ended up catching a flight on Rutaca Airlines a Venezuelan carrier at 4am the next morning). Communication between airline and passengers extremely poor led to almost hysteria at Cayenne airport. However Suriname Airways provided us with transport back to Cayenne where they put me and my partner up in the Best Western before transporting us back to the airport. So no complaints on that score; they did what they could to alleviate a bad situation.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Surinam Airways customer review,,2005-08-09,SLM flies 3 times a week from Amsterdam to Paramaribo and vice versa with their own Boeing 747-300.

Surinam Airways customer review,,2005-01-06,Cayenne-Paramaribo old MD-82 short trip (45 min.) arrived on time. Paramaribo-Cayenne old plane was broken and repairs would take days. It was their only plane. They had to rent an even older plane (with defunct lav) from Curaçao. An 8 h delay on a 45 min trip. As a result I missed my flight from Cayenne to Paris. Taking an earlier flight was not an option as they fly PBM-CAY only 3 times a week. Taxi rides from and to the airport + hotel bill: Surinam Airways wouldn't pay a penny. When I complained they replied that the 'change of schedule' was announced on the radio so I should have known and they are not responsible for anything. No chance of flying another airline. State-owned Surinam Airways has a monopoly on most routes in and out of Surinam.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
