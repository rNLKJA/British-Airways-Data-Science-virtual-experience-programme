I then proceeded on my own volition toward the lost and found office at the airport where, I found my luggage without a tag. Unassisted by any staff, whom when I said that I had a connecting flight, STILL made no effort to help me. Time was running out whereby I almost lost missed my connecting flight to Madrid.

Unfortunately I was so wrong! The worst experience I ever had with an airline, so disorganized! The flight started with 2 hours delay from scheduled departure. From the check in point you can feel that they are operating so wrong, just 1 line for 2 different flight NYC and LA with 3 hours apart one from the other.

They had snacks and simple drinks in the back for you to self serve as well. My baggage was not lost, I had no problems with overweight issues, and everything went smoothly in my opinion. Things could have been cleaner I will admit. And a charging port would be great as well. Entertainment wasn’t bad, I watched two movies.

"""Dreadful experience""",2,2022-06-24,"Dreadful experience, but they’re the only airline flying the route non-stop. My first experience was trying to pay for seat selections and checked baggage. Their website forwards to Alitalia, so unless the website language is set to Italian, the transaction does not go through. During one attempt, I was charged to my credit card, despite the transaction on their website showing an error for “time out”. It took about three hours to figure out how to pay for seat selections and checked bags. When it came time to check in, I noticed that my seat selection I had paid USD 75 was not applied to my ticket, so called the help desk. After waiting on hold for what felt like an eternity, I was told there was nothing they could do, as the plane was full, so to email their complaints team for a refund. I did that over a week ago now and have received no response, so just filed a dispute with my credit card. I then found out that the airline doesn’t participate in TSA Pre-Check, so had to wait over an hour at security even though I have Global Entry (which includes TSA Pre-Check) for the specific reason of avoiding long security queues. Once boarded, I intended to use the WiFi do work for business purposes in order to not fall behind, but soon discovered the WiFi was not functioning and did not function throughout the entirety of the flight. Meals were small and insufficient in frequency. We were served two small meals once the course of the 12-hour flight. Snacks were kept at the rear of the plane, and given how many passengers frequented the snack bar, it would seem many people agreed with my sentiments. The service I experienced with ITA Airways was a sorry start to what would ultimately be an absolutely incredible holiday.
