"""great value for money""",8,2019-08-18,"This trip was a choice between Thai Smile and AirAsia. Ultimately we chose AirAsia as they were significantly cheaper. I arrived at the airport pretty late as driving to the airport before sunrise proved to be a challenge, so many U turns and unlit signs. I prefer Suvarnabhumi Airport over Don Mueang as it's just one easy turn off the intercity motorway. Check in reminded me of Heathrow Terminal 2 where everybody prints out their own boarding pass and checks their own bag. AirAsia assigns a seat for you. If you're not happy with it you have to pay to change it. There was a staff member asking if anybody was leaving within the hour, and directed us to the manned check in counter. Probably the fastest check in experience I have had, after typing our names off our driving licences he handed us our boarding passes and we were off to security. I must note that these boarding passes are essentially just a receipt with a barcode on it. Boarding by bus was complicated but somehow in the confusion we left on time and touched down 10 minutes early. I had preordered a Nasi Lemak on this flight, and it was served piping hot with a complimentary bottle of water. Not very large but decent for 120 baht paid. The seat is quite small but somehow it is better than some legacy carriers, I'm looking at you Singapore Airlines! On the return flight, the kiosk check in did not work, so we went to the actual check in counters to get our boarding pass. What was really odd was that we were assigned seats 7A and 8C, yet 8B was empty which makes me wonder why the system somehow messed up our seat assignments even though we are in the same booking. On this flight, I didn't preorder anything and bought the last hot meal left, rice with chicken teriyaki. Not the most appealing option but I was hungry. They also asked if I wanted to try their Boba milk tea. It was quite unique to get that on a plane but too sweet for my taste. The captain had already started the descent when I was being served, apparently some really strong tailwinds put us 20 minutes ahead of schedule. This was a quick day trip, and we chose AirAsia seeing that we didn't need to check any luggage, both of us had a purse bag and that was it. The crew on all flights were excellent and worked tirelessly to make all passengers feel welcome onboard. The problems that need addressing: I think a mobile boarding pass would be a good idea, I could've just gone through security straight away after parking my car at the airport. The system should also ask if you prefer a window or an aisle seat, that at least saves you some trouble if you prefer the window or have to use the toilet during the flight. The biggest problem I have is the stocks of food onboard. A normal flight normally has only 10 hot meals available for purchase, the guy in the last row would have no chance of getting a hot meal. In the end, they have great value for money and since you get what you pay for, I wouldn't say they're a bad carrier especially given the price point. If you want to fly low cost in Asia, choose between AirAsia and Jetstar.

"""curious mixture of positives & negatives""",5,2016-11-30,"✅ Verified Review | My flying experience Bangkok DMK to Singapore with Thai AirAsia was a curious mixture of positives and negatives. AirAsia uses the older Don Mueang Airport to serve Bangkok. This was convenient for me as it is located quite close to my hotel, the Rama Gardens. DMK was considerably more crowded and run-down since the last time I visited when it was Bangkok's principal airport. The check-in counters are not well identified with signs, and I had to wander for a while and ask for guidance before I found the appropriate location. The Premium Flex add-on to the low DMK-SIN base fare costs about $30 USD and gives the passenger several priorities, including a separate check-in line, preferred boarding, more comfortable seating, a choice of hot meals, and 20 Kg of luggage. Once located, the check-in process was polite and efficient. Passport and security checks went reasonably quickly, but the terminal's air conditioning system didn't seem up to the challenge of the Thai sun and the teeming crowds. The boarding areas had more windows, but with the great views of the active runways came even more heat. The boarding process went smoothly. I had chosen one of the “Hot Seats” - the window seat in the forward, over-wing exit row. Except for these rows, which were empty, the flight was completely full. I don't know if this is a common feature of A320's, but the actual windows in these rows were so clouded with condensation moisture that they were essentially opaque. Another disappointment associated with these exit-row seats was that passengers in these seats are not allowed to purchase and consume the wine and beer that is sold on-board. The hot meal I had pre-ordered was actually quite tasty, but it would have been considerably improved with a Singha beer or two. Our departure and arrival were punctual, the crew were efficient and courteous, and the flight was smooth and uneventful.

Thai AirAsia customer review,7,2015-07-13,"FD 3112 outgoing flight delayed for over 45 minutes without prior notice, only display 20 minutes delay on screen before scheduled departure time. Aircraft clean enough but looked old with wear and tear. Seat tight and not so comfortable. FD 3111 return flight boarded punctually but delayed with passenger's carry on problem, seemed as though everybody could bring on  what they wanted. Their policy is not enforced whatsoever and that is very problematic. Cabin crew are polite, efficient and try their best. Food sold on board was fairly priced. Generally a fair experience and acceptable standard.",False,A320-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Had Yai,July 2015,2,4,,2,5,,,True
Thai AirAsia customer review,1,2015-07-04,"My first flight from Khon Kaen to was without any complaints. I had a tight connection and staff even changed my seat to the front of the plane to help me make my flight. Unfortunately once I got to DMK everything went horribly. No one could direct me to domestic transfer flights. Once I missed my flight and went to the counter of AirAsia the woman only told me that I shouldn't have booked such a short connection (even though online allowed me to) and that the next flight she could put me on was on Monday. Told I would have to pay for the new flight, I immediately went to Nok Air for a new flight. Awful service.",False,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DMK to Koh Samui,July 2015,2,2,,2,2,,,False
