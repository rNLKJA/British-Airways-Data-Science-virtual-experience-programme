"""crew was clearly tired""",6,2019-01-03,"Helsinki to Moscow. Nordic Regional Airlines operated flight on behalf of Finnair. Not a great start as it was delayed 45 mins. The crew was clearly tired, just barely kept their eyes open. Plane about 10+ years old Embraer 190. Dirty seat covers, yuck! Service was Finnair's basic low budget concept: Free coffee or tea, or blueberry juice. Of course snacks are available if you like to use extra money. I bought a long drink for 5 euros. With the help of a strong tailwind our flight almost caught up the delayed time. Flight time today only 1hr 20mins. Everything was ok, although i didn't really like the sleepy crew.",True,E190,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Helsinki to Moscow,December 2018,3,3,,4,3,,True
