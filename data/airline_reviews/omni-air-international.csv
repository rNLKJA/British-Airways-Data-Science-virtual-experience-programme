"""Quite disappointing experience""",1,2021-12-19,"Not Verified |  Quite disappointing experience. On a charter via National Geographic. Boarding was delayed and disorganized. The cabin crew was the worst I have ever experienced in my 100+ flight experience. Sloppy, disheveled looking, several attendants were not wearing masks during the flight or while serving people which is inexcusable during COVID. Food was poor as well, but mostly lack of confidence in cabin crew was the reason for this review. Our flight home was delayed with no announcements despite our plane being here for 3.5 hours while we sat watching and waiting.",False,Boeing 767-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Miami to Santiago, Chile",December 2021,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,1,False
"""worst airline I have ever flown""",2,2021-08-06,"I am military so I am constantly flying and I have got to say this is the worst airline I have ever flown, without question. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable, the staff was very rude. We were delayed 28 hours because our radars stopped working midair and we had to turn around and come back. As soon as there is an issue, instead of resolving it, they delay a whole day so the crew can get their per diem money. Food wasn’t bad though.",True,Boeing 767-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Yokota to Seattle-Tacoma,August 2021,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",1,2,,,False
"""worst airline I've ever flown on""",1,2021-07-12,"The worst airline I've ever flown on. The airplane was shabby and dirty inside. The flight crew was inattentive and rude. They couldn't be bothered to do a thing for anyone, got aggressive and rude if anyone dared bothered them or go against their will.  This was a military charter flight, every passenger was respectful, well behaved, and obedient to begin with, not just random members of the public; yet the flight crew treated us like trash from the first minute of the flight till the last.",True,Boeing 777,Business,Economy Class,Tokyo to Atlanta,July 2021,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,2,,,False
"""feel welcome and comfortable""",8,2020-04-22,Not Verified |  Vancouver to Honolulu via Ottawa. We had the pleasure of flying Omni after a very long delayed (missed connection) flight and they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable. The higher level of service is very evident in the crew's demeanor and professionalism. Penny and Ilya were particularly helpful and went out of their way to make our flight memorable. Thank you to the entire team!,False,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Honolulu via Ottawa,January 2020,4,5,,5,5,,,True
"""on the tarmac waiting and waiting""",4,2020-02-26,Not Verified |  Vancouver to Phoenix. We sat on the tarmac waiting and waiting for passengers to make their connection. The flight attendant already announced that everyone was on board and the captain comes up and says we are waiting for 3 more passengers. What is fair? To give us an on time arrival or wait for passengers and get everyone delayed?

"""no leg room in comfort class""",1,2019-09-18,"Not Verified | Honolulu to Las Vegas. I purchased a first-class as I have a disability and overweight. The seat was so small I made to sit sideways the entire flight. On my return flight, I changed seats to sit in comfort class, that was a joke. I felt unsafe on both flights as we had no leg room in comfort class and no room in first class. The people I changed seats with said that they would never pay for first class on this airline again. All in all, this was the biggest mistake I ever made, this was a joke. I felt the staff were wonderful, the service was great, but that's where it stopped. Just to let you know how bad my first-class seat was when I got to Las Vegas I could not walk for 2 days. I don't write reviews but this was so bad I thought you needed to know.",False,Boeing 767,Couple Leisure,First Class,Honolulu to Las Vegas,September 2019,1,5,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,,False
"""the comfort was amazing""",10,2017-10-07,"✅ Verified Review |  Malaga to Birmingham. Originally a Monarch Airlines flight, this was operated by Omni Air International chartered in by the CAA. The aircraft was excellent, and spotless and the comfort was amazing. However the reason for my review is the excellent staff. They were kind, polite, helpful, considerate and lovely people, it was only a short flight from Malaga to Birmingham but we all said that we wished it was a longer flight, they gave us drinks and the most lovely toasted sandwiches which were fantastic. Please pass on the thanks of the passengers and myself.",False,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Malaga to Birmingham,October 2017,5,5,,5,5,,,True
"""staff and service were excellent""",9,2016-11-13,"Ramstein Air Force Base Germany to Baltimore-Washington. Flew as Space-A on the AMC- USAF Patriot Express or informally Freedom Bird. Seats were narrow, as would expect for transporting physically fit soldiers, but adequate legroom. Departure delayed for two hours for technical reasons, but better 'safe than sorry' since flight over Atlantic Ocean precludes any emergency diversion and landing! All seatback electronics functioned. Cabin staff and service were excellent! Supper (from Germany, not US) was to European standards, quite good, (not the untasty US airline food), and had a real breakfast, (not a 'snack' as on the inadequate 'other' charter company outbound). Crew was attentive, gracious, and always helpful. Overall, much better than US-flagged carriers and up to European standards. Although flew as military retired at minimal cost, I would be pleased to pay full-price ticket for the service rendered on this flight.",False,Boeing 777,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ramstein to BWI,October 2016,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",4,4,,,True
"""plagued with multiple problems""",2,2016-09-03,"El Paso to Kuwait via Bangor. Both of the times that I have flown using Omni the flight has been plagued with multiple problems. The first time, none of the entertainment systems worked (audio). The second time I flew with them, only half worked, and the plane broke down overnight in Maine. I've had multiple friends / coworkers who've been broken down in New Hampshire / Bangor. Omni needs to take this plane off line for a few months and upgrade this plane. Omni should be embarrassed about the quality of the plane taking the troops overseas. Come on dudes. The only upside was the friendly staff (flight attendants and pilots).",False,Boeing 767-300,Business,Economy Class,ELP to KWI via BGR,September 2016,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",2,3,,,False
"""the worst flight experience""",1,2016-06-13,"Shannon to Boston with Omni Air. I have been on many airlines over the years and never have I seen this bad of quality. The flight was a wet-lease flight with Aer Lingus, a great airline. However, OAI plane was old and dirty, entertainment systems are also dirty, hard to control, old, and not a big selection. The staff aboard was awful, rude, and overall this is the worst flight experience I have had. Highly recommend Aer Lingus, but not if it's operated by Omni Air. The only thing good about the flight was ground service provided by Aer Lingus.",False,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SNN to BOS,July 2015,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",3,1,,1,False
