We arrived to Toronto to take another flight to San Francisco. With 10+ hours of flying and only 1 hour to go to our next flight, you can imagine the exhaustion we had. We asked the workers if they can let us surpass the long line but they rudely told us to wait like everyone else. My family and I (which was 8 of us total) got in line. It was our turn to get inspected and we got through somewhat, however we had the concern that our gate was already opening. After the inspection, we had to wait just outside of it where there was a screen to wait for our names to turn green as they were x-raying our luggages to get to the US. With the last minutes of our gate closing, our concern grew and we were starting to panic because our names have not turned green yet. Not one worker helped us get to our gate and it seemed they did not care if we missed our flight. We ended up missing our flight and they told us to get to an air canada desk (which they were not specific about where this was). All of us ran through everywhere to find a desk and the workers were extremely rude and uncooperative about looking for a flight. They finally told us we had to get through the immigration customs, to get to an air canada desk to rebook our flights. We got through the immigration customs and we had to pick up our luggages. We face another issue where we could not find them. We initially thought they were on the flight we missed but fortunately they were just misplaced. We wait 30 minutes for them to give our luggages and once we get them we go to the desk. We get there and we are greeted rudely by an air canada employee where she tells one of my family members in a nasty attitude ""where does the line start?!"", implying that we should move out of the way so that other customers can be helped. We told her she was being rude and she denied it. Still, we moved out the way. An employee helped rebook our flights but we all had to get separated but at that point we did not care. They gave each one of us a hotel and meal vouchers but not to me  (which at the time i didn't check). So I had to pay for my meal which was $50.

Before our flight departed, I go up to the desk and tell them why our names has not been called and they tell us they thought we each had 2 luggages but we had 1 each. That was the whole wait up and they had to make sure the system says we are in the clear but through all that we miss our flight while heading to the next long line to immigration. So, we go back and they help us rebook our flight within the next hour and hasten ourselves because we are already traumatized that we will miss our flight for the 3rd time.

There were in fact 5 major problems I encountered trying to get tickets I had already paid for. 1. I tried to check in online the day before but their system wouldn’t let me. I then called Air Canada and was on hold for 4 hours. When someone finally answered, she told be to try again 24 hours before the second flight. That didn’t work either. 2.

The app worked poorly and I got locked out with the app saying I could only redo in 24 hours. Air Canada then told me they not give me a ticket. I eventually redid the app and change to my wife’s phone number. I later talked to fellow travelers in our group who took a different airline that did not require this app. 4.

Another flight attendant heard his behaviour and came back to ask me how I liked the wine I selected. I thought that was very nice of her. When another flight attendant came to remove my tray and I held on to the wine glass, she asked me if I wanted more. I appreciated that and she even came back one more time to refill.

Two things happened on this trip, first, the Boeing 787-9 (long haul flight) upkeep and comfort was in dark contrast to the Airbus A220-300 used for the 1 hour flight. Yes, the Airbus A220-300 was a much more comfortable flight in everyway. Second, I arrived in Montreal after a very very long journey and had to wait in the understaffed luggage claims line, for another hour, with 30 or so other passengers from exclusively AC flights, all of us with missing luggage, confused and tired. During this wait, we witnessed the comedy act of airport security walling off the luggage carrousel which was overpiling with late / delayed lost baggage. No information was shared other than, we will let you know, enjoy your stay in Canada. After 2 weeks of calling, filing in useless complaints reports on AC's website and making trips to the airport, I was finally re-united with one bag, which was in a 3rd party storage facility a 15 mins drive from the airport, the 2nd bag was delivered the following day. Compensation? fill in another report and attach your receipts (what justification can you give a passenger for delaying their baggage for 2 weeks, I flew to your hub in Toronto for God's sake, the layover was 4 hours how did you misplace the luggage?). During this time all the communication and effort was one way, this is a disgusting level of due diligence from an airline which promotes itself as excellence. This is not excellence, this is utter garbage. On my return flight I flew premium economy, little did I know, I would experience the novelty of skipping a hot meal on a flight for the 1st time in my life, the food was inedible. In September (3 months after my flight) an AC customer service agent emails me stating ''we have decided to compensate you for your 14 day delayed baggage, we are happy to give $400 CAN. $400 CAN for losing my luggage for 2 weeks. On top of that, the customer service agent instructs me to share all, and I mean ALL, of my banking info. so that they could transfer this meagre payoff. Why? They do not have a system which allows transfer's to customer's living abroad.  its 2022, I used a credit card to pay for the flight, all details of which are logged and registered on your system, at least, a normally functioning company's system.

The flight was operated by a Boeing 777-200LR with a 3-4-3 seat formation, which is standard today for this type of aircraft, but meant that seats were rather on the narrow side. The legroom was relatively tight. In particular, it bothered me that the life west of the seat in front of me blocked a lot of the room under the seat so that it was difficult to stretch my legs, something I have not experienced on the same type of aircraft with other airlines. However, the recline was fine for a standard economy seat. I did not find the food tasty, and the portions were also rather on the small side. But the service was overall friendly and attentive. There was a bar for (non-alcoholic) drinks during the flight and the cabin attendants occasionally passed through the cabin to offer water. The worst part of the experience was the deplaning: We arrived at the gate half an hour late. It was announced that only connecting passengers should leave the aircraft (regardless of whether they had a tight connection), while everyone else had to stay on board (of course, this was not enforced for Business class passengers). When all the connecting passengers (or those who claimed to be) had left, we had to wait for five minutes (why?), before everyone else could deplane. Overall the process was chaotic and inefficient. It took 20 minutes from arriving at the gate, until I could leave the aircraft even though I was seated at the front of the cabin. Overall, it was by far not my favourite way to cross the Atlantic.

"""the crew made us feel welcome""",8,2022-09-18,"Not Verified |  I was expecting the worst when I stepped aboard this 787-8 at EDI. I was the first passenger aboard and there was no one to greet me. After an initial rush of excitement that there was no crew and we would have free run of the aircraft cabin crew dashed up the aisle to greet us, looking slightly surprised that boarding had started without their knowledge. We were shown to our seats, stowed our hand baggage in the 787's massive overhead bins, and settled down. Cabin crew came by to introduce themselves and take our food and beverage orders. There were no pre-departure drinks nor hot towels. I looked at the amenity kit; socks and an eyeshade, unbranded, in a black plastic pouch. I grimaced. We taxied out to the westbound runway and were underway about an hour after scheduled departure time. Drinks service commenced swiftly after takeoff and I was soon enjoying Laurent Perrier brut and a packet of cashews. My eighteen-month old son had fallen asleep in my arms during the take-off run - as one does - and was now sleeping soundly. The purser came and suggested I make use of the empty 1D as a bed for him. Seated in 2A I could just about see his feet if I poked my head over the aisle - the privacy on this configuration of seating is very good. Lunch was served as we climbed out over the Western Isles and was very good. Drinks service was decent throughout the first two hours of the flight and nothing felt rushed, or too much trouble. My woke at about the two hour point and was hungry. The cabin crew swiftly prepared a meal for him and none of it felt like too much trouble at all. After about three hours it was time for bed, with the cabin crew locking the window dimmers and turning off the lights. The fact that it was early afternoon local time and mid morning at destination didn't seem a factor. most of the business class cabin obeyed the crew's wishes and went to sleep. I turned to the entertainment system. While the choice of movies is pretty decent, the decision to include two episodes, mid season, from TV shows is baffling. As is the inclusion of three-hour long music programmes, which must be listened to in entirety with no option to skip to the song you want. Why whole albums can't just be uploaded giving the user the ability to navigate to the music they want to listen to, like almost all airlines do these days, is truly baffling. The entertainment system doesn't feel cheap at all, but this particular part of it felt like it had been beamed in from some tragic charter flight from 1990. After a couple of hours had elapsed the intermission was over and it was time to wake up again. Normal service resumed and we were served a snack of charcuterie, cheeses, bread, and pickles. Soon it was time for landing and we found ourselves back on the ground in Toronto. The cabin crew answered that ""metered deplaning"" was in effect and 50 passengers would be allowed off every five minutes, with connecting passengers taking priority. Although we couldn't provide evidence of having a connection as we hadn't been able to check in online for our onward United flight, the purser let us off anyway.

Boarding was very easy via Zone-1 and we were able to get our carry on into the overhead lockers (Full flight as well) on the new Airbus-220 in which we found clean and well appointed.

Boarding in YYZ for FRA was seamless using Zone-1 and flight left late due to the number of passengers (full flight).

On arrival in FRA, we start at the B-Concourse with a 20-minute walk through immigration to the baggage hall where our baggage (4 pieces) was coming off the belt. On our return we changed a later flight to an earlier domestic connection easily thanks to the FRA staff. The MLL in FRA was excellent well appointed with food, drink with helpful staff. Even took advantage of having a shower before departure which was very nice. The FRA YYZ flight was exceptional service as well great food and drink. Even the Captain entered the first J Cabin to talk to passengers which was a nice touch. On arrival in YYZ no issues with customs or immigration with thanks to the Arrive Canada Ap and NEXUS.

"""help resolve this long-overdue claim""",1,2022-09-04,"On 17 Jul 22, my family and I traveled under Air Canada (AC) booking # 4GN88Y to catch a flight (flight # AC8927) from Toronto (TOR) to Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) leaving Toronto-Pearson IAP at 2030 hrs. We had arrived earlier in the day around 1630 to TOR on AC flight AC897 from Athens, Greece; an exhausting/grueling 10-hour flight. We had about a four-hour layover between flights. Around 2025 hrs, just before our scheduled boarding time, an AC rep, announced over the PA system there could be a delay of about a 1/2 hour - hour, as a co-pilot had not arrived for our flight. Surprisingly, around 2045 hrs, the AC rep announced we all would board the plane for PIT. All PIT passengers boarded the flight for PIT, after about 15 - 20 mins we were informed by the pilot that the co-pilot hadn't arrived, the flight was canceled, and we had to deplane & go back in the terminal and see AC personnel on the 3rd floor for assistance in rebooking our flight. My family/all of the PIT-bound passengers deplaned & went inside, where an AC rep let us know we would have to go through Customs (Again!), and try to get rebooked on another PIT flight. This would be the last information an in-person AC rep gave us at TOR IAP, and things became very disorganized. We made it through customs and went to retrieve our bags; no AC rep was there to give guidance/assistance (took over an hour!). The AC area was a catastrophe complete with crying children & stressed-out adults who didn't know what to do. When we finally got my daughter’s luggage it was badly damaged (caster wheel missing/hard case cracked); the luggage was only a few yrs old, and cost around $100. We discussed renting a car (one-way to PIT) and driving home that night, as my wife and I had work the next day, and my daughter had a law school prep class. We were exhausted & just needed to get home. While my wife & daughter, who were exhausted & frustrated waited for our baggage, I went to the 3rd floor & tried to find an in-person AC rep, but to no avail, all AC personnel appeared to be gone for the day. An airport employee directed me to a bank of phones to contact AC for rebooking & to get a voucher for a hotel if we had to stay overnight. I called from the bank of phone; got disconnected! However, a fellow passenger was able to get in touch with an AC (""Brian"", I believe), who advised he could book my family on a AC Flight from TOR to PIT the next afternoon around 1415 hrs. He also advised he couldn't help with securing a hotel, but if we could manage to get a hotel room, we could submit the expenses to AC for ""prompt"" reimbursement. I asked Brian about getting reimbursed by AC for renting a car and driving home (one-way rental to PIT); he informed AC would definitely reimburse us for this expense, as well as fuel costs for the vehicle, if we submitted receipts to the AC website. Based upon the affirmative representation from an AC rep that we would be reimbursed for renting a vehicle (& fuel for vehicle) we made the decision to rent a car, which took over an hour and cost $300; we also incurred fuel and toll charges. Arrived home about 0545 hrs, totally stressed out and sick to our stomachs. Filed a claim with AC & after now about 45 days, all we have received is an auto reply email AC rec'd our claim. No reimbursement, no phone call from AC with an update, & certainly no apology from AC!

Most looked like passengers were bothering them, and they wished they were somewhere else. The flight from Montreal to Newark was horrible. This airline knows exactly how many passengers are scheduled to arrive and depart probably down to the minute, yet for multiple flights connecting through Montreal there were only 3 customs agents.

We would receive a text message or email telling us our flight was delayed for 45 minutes. 30 minutes after that, we'd get another delay message. No plane was present at the gate during any of these delay messages, so I knew it was going to be much longer than 45 minutes.

She did promise to get a manager. About 30 minutes later, someone shows up. She never announces anything, never talks to anyone, never asks if anyone needs assistance. My son, who has a seizure disorder, needed sleep but there were no accommodations for him and we had no idea how long the delay would ultimately be.

It was only after I noticed someone getting delivered a hot dish that you could order 2 different meals from your table. I ordered the flat bread pizza, which was ok. The other option was a vegetarian curry, I headed to the gate early but as I arrived I received a notification from AC that the gate changed so I went to the new gate. Boarding was delayed just over an hour as inbound aircraft came from the US and was at the US gates so they had to wait for it to be towed to our gate. Boarding was chaotic as ever but since I was in zone 1 I got to board right away. I was not greeted by name. I took my seat (4D, aisle seat in the last row of business class). A couple asked me to switch to 4B so they could sit together. Since it was the same seat just on the opposite side of the aisle I obliged (I like aisle seats). FAs handed out Air Canada's Care Kits before departure and they took orders for dinner. The options were a chicken dish with a rice/quinoa mix, or a vegetarian gnocchi. Pillows and blankets were handed out but they were just the cheap ones used in international economy. Cheap earbuds were also offered. The seat was clean but not at all comfortable. I booked business so I would have a more comfortable 6 hour journey overnight but I found it very uncomfortable. While the legroom was good, the entertainment box impeded my legroom. My preferred seat in economy on my return flight (separate review) was actually more spacious. Dinner was served shortly after takeoff. Since it was close to midnight at this point I really wasn't in the mood to eat but I went for the chicken dish, which was small and quite bland. Surprisingly that was the only service offered on the 6 hour flight. While I wasn't expecting another meal I did fully expect a beverage service before arrival.

During the Lisbon - Montreal flight I was told by flight attendants that a gate agent would meet the flight on arrival in Montreal to help with connections which turned out not to be the case. There were no employees anywhere around where we exited nor any monitors on connecting information as all arriving international passengers had to go through immigration even before going to their connecting gate. Air Canada sent me a text since I had missed my connection in Montreal notifying me that it had automatically booked me on two new flights to replace my prior non-stop flight. There were no new boarding passes tied to the text and so I went to the Air Canada customer service desk on arrival to get my new boarding passes. The employee there said I would need to go to baggage claim and speak to a representative there first to get my bag and then I would need to recheck it on the 2 new flights.

We made a dash to the gate our original flight was leaving from, with our original boarding cards to see if we could get on the flight - we were denied boarding as they had already given our seats to someone else (not acceptable) When we asked what our next steps were as we would now be in Toronto for at least 24 hours more we were told to find a customer service agent as theY were the only ones who could help, then ignored when asking where we would find one. We had to brave arrival border checks with the ridiculous machines they have in Toronto, then explain the story to the Border Guard to be let through to departures again, where the queue was to see the “customer service” agent. The queue was not moving very quickly and at around 23.15 one of the agents announced that they finished work at midnight and not everyone would be dealt with - as the issues are purely the fault of a disorganised & inept airline I find this attitude totally wrong, and feel there should be someone there to deal with issues at whatever time is needed, especially as they also do not answer the phone.

I refused to do this and stood my ground, advising I did not have the money to pay for a hotel/the taxis to and from it so they would need to find a hotel for me - amazingly enough a hotel became available after about 15 minutes, along with $20 each for food for the next 24 hours.

The connecting agent didn't know this though - and neither did I till I read my sms's two days later when I got home. Instead she tried to get me on standby on the flight I was going to get, I got on - but then they pulled me off the plane - I didn't notice but they'd given me someone else's boarding pass who arrived after me. He looked very pleased to be getting on the plane, they didn't explain to me that they'd messed up giving me his boarding pass and I hadn't noticed till someone pointed it out later. So the gate agent said ""go to customer service"" and there isn't any in YUL departures so I had to find a gate agent. Anyway, I was now stuck in departures like Tom Hanks in the terminal with no plane and no reason to be there so I can't exit - I then spent two hours begging AC people to help me and they kept sending me to other people, eventually I found a lady who was eventually sympathetic but initially thought I'd stolen someone's boarding pass.

Hail a few AC automatons ""yeh we told them they need more people - sorry"", ""I can't do any more"" (this is a favorite), ""you'll get there eventually"" etc. After thirty mins three other surly miserable people show up and start checking people in. Queue is now over 150. Get bag tag, get told off for removing old bag tag from non existent flight.

We get on our plane to Toronto and everything is fine and we even land a little bit early. Then, we get told we have to wait for an open gate. That’s fine, we didn’t mind it. We waited and waited and the captain got back on the PA and told us that he got lied to and that nobody was responding the whole time until after at least an hour past, and that we would have to wait for another gate to open. The captain then stated that one shouldn’t be long. He didn’t come back onto the PA until another half hour past to let us know they were about to clear that gate up. All in all it took us close to 2 hours to get into a gate. You would think this would have made us miss our flight to London Heathrow. But the good thing about Air Canada is that flight was delayed too. So we made it and didn’t take off for almost another 2 hours from the scheduled time because they were waiting on the pilot or first officer AND ground crew. We finally took off and arrived in LHR and were cutting it close to our next flight for Istanbul. We were hoping to get into a gate immediately this time.  We waited 30 minutes in the tarmac this time which inevitably made us miss our next flight. We get to LHR to find out that our bags weren’t there with us. I wonder what the two hour delay was for but that’s beside the point. If you had 2 hours extra, you would think they’d get everything right since they already had so much go wrong. We idk course just accept our fate and go get rebooked for the next flight out to Istanbul. Of course it was the biggest inconvenience for them to rebook us for their mistakes. I even got questioned as to why I couldn’t make the flight if we landed at a certain time which I then responded to the associate and let them know we had landed but we’re just hanging out on the tarmac with no gate. She had no response and didn’t even apologize for the accusation that we purposely missed the flight. Everything beyond this point got so much easier in terms of dealing with airport personnel.  We finally make it Istanbul and got make a report with Turkish Airlines to get our lost baggage. We would call everyday to get an update and it was something different everyday. I don’t blame Turkish Airlines for this. They didn’t lose the bag. They just are delivering it. I didn’t get my bag for 3 days and it was at night on the third day. So that left a total of just one day of the trip with my belongings. I had to wear the same outfit until I could go and maybe buy something else. My friend didn’t receive his baggage at all and they said it would be delivered the day we were leaving which means it would get here after we’re gone.

We could not wait until the following day and they would no compensate for a hotel, food or in any other way, So we had to Uber back from Toronto to Windsor and then pick up our bag from the airport the next morning. That flight was also delayed so our bags were still late. And nobody checks to see who is picking up the bags or if they belong to those people.

"""Customer representatives are definitely not there to help you""",1,2022-05-25,"I have flown many times over the years with different airlines. Air Canada is the worst airline I've ever seen. First of all, what I didn't realize before buying the ticket is that the website is quite amateur and has many shortcomings. Sometimes you may not be able to access your flight information even if you want to. You may have to wait a few hours. Sometimes, when you are looking for a new ticket, you may not be able to make the search you want. Sometimes you even have to wait a bit to log in to your account. Things get worse when it comes to customer service. If you're in a hurry, you definitely can't get your work done via email. It takes at least 2 days to get a response, sometimes even longer. If you want to call by phone, you have to deal with customer representatives who are unaware of their work. You get conflicting information with each phone call. Customer representatives are definitely not there to help you. They just give you simple information that you can also access from their website. I wouldn't recommend calling them for help when you have a problem. It would be more convenient to cancel the ticket directly. I was going to travel to Turkey via Canada. I could not find even the slightest information on the website that said I needed a visa to make a transit flight from Canada, so I was not allowed on my flight. At least 3 different Air Canada employees told me that the online visa would be finalized in 2 days. So I started to consider buying a new ticket for 5 days later. However, if you are going to buy a new ticket, you cannot buy a ticket from the standard category, they force you to buy it from the flex category. But the greatest injustice begins here. When you look at the advantages of the flex category on the website, it appears to be fully refundable. But in the phone call I made with customer service, they said that there was no such thing and I could not get a refund. At that time I claimed on the website that we had been lied to and the only answer I got was no. Despite what I saw with my own eyes, no explanation was given, denying that we are not lying. In a different phone call, I was told that they sold my new ticket in the flex category, but I could not benefit from the advantages of flex since the first ticket I bought was in the standard category. Now they say I can get a refund of $800 for my flight that I paid $1800 in total. Or as a travel voucher, I could get the entire amount back. But to use the travel voucher, I need to fly somewhere through Canada because this airline operates all flights through Canada to save money for the Canadian government and its own airlines. There are no flights within the US, so it's almost impossible for me to use that travel voucher. Because of this, I bought a new ticket from United Airlines and paid another $1850. Even calculating my financial loss is quite difficult, but I know that I have lost a lot. I don't even want to think about the psychological damage, I spent 2 days on the phone dealing with all this nonsense because it can take you over an hour to reach someone due to the lack of customer service staff. In short, I would not recommend anyone to use this airline.

They had us wait for an hour until one person started checking people in. At 12:05 the lady at the counter said they could not find my ticket in the system and sent me to Lufthansa. The lady at Lufthansa called customer service and asked about my reservation with Air Canada. She said they were able to find it, but they changed the ticket from Air Canada to Lufthansa. After boarding flight LH 0470 all passengers had to wait almost 2 hours inside the plane since they were bringing in the food (catering). Because the flight was delayed I missed my connection in Toronto going to San Francisco. When I arrived in Toronto it was a mess; all of those who lost connections were told to go to different places, some were told to go to Air Canada Customer service, others were asked to go through security and then to the information booth. I spoke to a lady who said that Air Canada was understaffed and there was supposed to be someone helping those who lost connections after we left the plane. There was nobody helping and all the staff members seemed clueless as to what to do. At least 13 passengers were in the same situation as me. We had lost our connections and since we arrived at 7pm instead of 5pm and there were no other flights to our destinations. All of us who lost connections went through security and had to enter Canada to be able to get to the information booth at the entrance of the airport as they had told us to go. When trying to explain our situation to staff there, they would send us somewhere else or tell us to call customer service. I have traveled many times and this is the most disorganized experience I have had. We decided to wait next to the information booth and not move until someone came to help us. They tried to send us away and have us call customer service, but we did not have anywhere to go so we stayed there until someone came. We waited at the information booth and started calling the operator to get staff from Air Canada to help us. We needed to book new flights and we needed a place to stay for that night. We were in the airport for over 3 hours, until a group of people came to help and told us they were sending us to the Marriott hotel for that night. They gave us one voucher for dinner and one for breakfast and sent us away. We were at the airport from 7pm to 10pm then got sent to the hotel. I booked my new flight for noon the next day and asked if I needed to take a new covid test. Nobody had that information. Finally I decided to go to sleep at midnight and figure it out the next morning. In the morning I found that there was a Covid testing site at the airport and went to take the test.

I have not flown on Air Canada for a while and will not be doing so in the near future. This was horrible from the clerk at the baggage drop-off to the boarding hostesses - rude and complete incompetence. It first started at the Air Canada luggage drop off point. The clerk pointed out that my carry-on was too big and requested I paid 115$ for the extra bag. So, I transferred everything to a small bag I had inside and to my other bags. When she weighed everything, one bag was 21 kg and the other 25 (2 kgs over the limit). She requested I remove the extra 2 kg or pay 100 $. I managed to remove the extra weight which she accepted. To my surprise at the gate, the hostess flags my boarding pass during boarding literally calling me a thief because I failed to pay the overweight and oversize fee. I was shocked, I tried to explain that this was an error and there is no way I made it through the security without paying. The hostess flat out told me I was lying and that there was no way for them to know I was telling the truth. They made me wait until all passengers boarded then a supervisor came and confirmed that I was telling the truth and that the clerk made a mistake. I was finally allowed to board. Please note: no apologies were offered for the inconvenience. As I was walking to the airplane to board, I started to experience some cramps in my hips since I was standing for a long time. I had to stopped in the middle of the ramp and wait for the pain to stop. To add to my frustration, here come another hostess asking me to move or she will get my name off the plane! I explained that I am having a cramp and just need a couple of minutes. The lady repeated herself saying that I needed to move or else my name will be removed from the plane. When she saw I ignored her and was still holding my hip she run off to the counter saying - ""that’s it, I am removing your name from the flight""..

Went back home All good I booked the flight through Expedia, got a refund and my expedia account was re-issued the credits again. Booked through Expedia for another flight for the next day to the same location. Flight was scheduled for 8:05am. Ok I decided to show up 2 and a half hours before the flight just to be safe. Get to the airport at roughly 5:30am, standing in line to check in and the lineup doesn't look too long. But They only have 3 people working the computers and the line moves incredibly slow. After almost an hour and twenty minutes of waiting in line I start to panic because I have only made it a little over halfway through this lineup. I start flagging down Air Canada staff to alert them that I may miss my flight if things don't speed up. Alerted one girl and she said : ""ok sir, someone will be over to assist you."" 15 minutes goes by with no assistance and I alert another girl. She gives me the same line as the other girl. And the same exact outcome. Nobody comes to assist me. After 15 more minutes I hop over the rope to the counter and beg them to please have someone come over and help me, or I will miss my flight. Again the girl tries to re-assure me they will help me and tells me to get back in line. Well after 2+ hours in line, and not one Air Canada staff coming over to help After I had asked.

Got the credit for Air Canada flights on my expedia account. Decided to try and book another flight with my available credit, but the expedia representative told me he couldn't book it because Air Canada had suspended my ticket, and I needed to call Air Canada to open it. Try to call Air Canada and they said they aren't taking any calls at the moment. Anyways I'm stuck with a 900$ balance for Air Canada that I now can't use until they get back to me.

At one point many of us reaching the front of the line were asked to break off and form a new line off to the side to make more space.

She told us we have to go back to the end of the line we were previously in if we wanted to be served. When other passengers became frustrated and mentioned that we have been waiting the longest and were asked to stand there, the ground staff responded that it wasn't true and that there was no way we've been waiting for 3 hours so far. Some people reacted by yelling while others started to cry from frustration.

Everyone from that flight was made to stand on a long line while waiting on ONE customer service representative to attend to the 100 plus people from my flight and trying to assist an additional 50 plus people that had flights to other destinations. Needless to say the 50 plus people that had flights to other destinations were attended to while myself and the passengers that had been deplaned were told after an hour to come back tomorrow because our flight had been postponed to 8am the following day (July 1st). We had made reservations to drive from Newark to Ocean City MD for a two night stay but due to Air Canada we did not make it and we were only able to enjoy half a day and a one night stay and due to it being the Fourth of July no extensions were being offered.

Long story short, I went over to the United counter and the gentleman who I believe was the supervisor,  stated to me that he would ""try his best to put me on a flight to Toronto.""

I would've expected that my $350 credit would be applied to the new $590 flight, and I'd just have to pay the remaining balance of $240. This is not what happened. The credit of $350 was only good for $43 dollars on this new flight, and the rest of the credit vanished ($307), and I'm now at a net expense of $853 because I was charged an additional $546 ""tax charge"" for the new Dublin flight booking (on top of the remaining $307 credit value that couldn't be applied and doesn't exist anymore).

This way I could keep my original $350 credit to save for a later date to use for Seattle specifically, and get full use of the credit value, and just book the Dublin flight separately on my own.

"""our seats were changed""",1,2020-02-16,"Not Verified | Toronto to Rome via London. Air Canada treats Aeroplan members as second class citizens I am posting this warning to all those you fly with Air Canada and who use air miles to book flights. Air Canada clearly discriminates amongst its passengers. This is now my second experience and hence definitive confirmation of these discriminatory practices. I recently booked a flight to Europe from Toronto using my aeroplan miles. Upon booking my 2 flights I went through the seat selection process, selected seats and paid $125 each for that privilege. The payment was processed by Air Canada and written confirmation received of those specific seat allocations via email. Weeks later I received an “Air Canada – SEAT CHANGE” notification, arbitrarily moving our seats from Row 18 (seats bought and paid for – for extra legroom due to a leg issue I have) to Row 33. and then said I would be refunded the seat selection fees. Completely arbitrary and not honoring the initial seat purchase! Since this was the second time this has happened to me, (the first time being much worse, which I will explain later on in this message) I had to speak out. I immediately emailed Air Canada after trying to get a hold of their customer service Dept – advised by an automated call that the wait time was more than 1.5 hrs - really? Maybe this is a factor of the significant quantum of customer complaint volume. I then received the token automated response to my submission form Air Canada “we will address your concern within 30 days”. Hence my public action here! As noted this is the second time this has happened. In 2018, on flights to/from Miami for attending a family wedding, I had booked 4 seats using Aeroplan miles and paid full fare for one seat (full-fare seat for my disabled father) in upgraded seating. We booked almost 8 months in advance, with the express purpose of early booking, being getting our seats assigned together so as to assist my disabled father on/off the plan and supporting him during the flights. Eight months early! All our seat selections were confirmed in writing to us by Air Canada at that time. Again, just before the flight (a week before) we get a notification that our seats were changed. Let me clarify this point - only our Aeroplan booked seats were changed! Not my father’s full-fare seat! I called to complain, they said it just happens. It was too close to the flight to seek any other remedy. In the end, it left us sitting in the back of the plane and my father sitting alone with strangers and without support to deal with his disability! Unbelievable! After our return, I complained through proper AC channels to ascertain the genesis of the change notice, highlighting the blatant fact that only the seats booked with air miles were changed and not full-fare seat. The AC response again was, it happens! The offered me a 25% discount coupon for a future flight. I don’t want coupons! I want honest, fair and non-discriminatory service from a Canadian company. Disgraceful! Now this has happened again and cannot stay silent as it is now clear beyond any doubt that Air Canada discriminates against its passengers.

We had less than 2 hours to go through customs, get our baggage, then recheck baggage before boarding. Of course going through security was slow and on top of that, baggage claim had mechanical issues so we were delayed another 10 minutes. By the time we reached baggage drop off, the agent simply told us too late and that we missed our flight. No explanation or any effort whatsoever to reach out to the agents boarding for our flight. We got redirected to a check in area where we were then booked as standby for the next flight with the agent telling us that we would most likely get on. Now we understand seats are not guaranteed but at least have the agents be a little empathetic about our situation that was not our fault. Cue boarding time for the standby flight: the agent was rude and bluntly told all standbys that we were not getting on. Naturally people were upset and wanted answers. But this particular agent was so rude and yelled back at everyone to shut up as there was nothing she can do on her end. Funny, I thought these agents are supposed to provide customer service? Didn't know being yelled at and made to feel like missing our original flight was part of their job description. I can understand feeling attacked when you have angry customers all come at you, but that's part of your job to be able to keep your cool in these situations!

She couldn't or wouldn't tell us what our other options are if we were to be denied this last flight as well. So here we are waiting for the last flight hoping to get on while we're all upset with how we were just treated. Long story short, the flight crew was lovely but ground staff?

We were told to exit customs and go downstairs to baggage claim to collect our stuff and head to the hotel. We waited 8 hours for our baggage and it never came.  We spoke to baggage agents 7 times and had them call our specific bag tag numerous times over with no luck. One agent even showed us a picture of our baggage scanned into the warehouse and knew the exact cage number it was stored in, but no one would retrieve it for us.

So are connecting flight was boarding in 20 minutes as we lay in wait on the runway. We checked Air Canada site and it stated that our connecting flight was delayed 2 hours. So my wife and I believed we had time to make the connecting flight being that we were sitting for our an hour on the runway. Well we were wrong not only didn’t they let people with connecting flights exit off plane first but the staff and the website lied about the delay. (The connecting flight was on time) As we approached the gate to our flight we were stopped and not allowed to enter US customs because they closed at 9pm. We arrived at the gate at 849pm and had time to walked 50 feet to customs. But not to our knowledge Air Canada already rebooked our flight for the following day for 920pm without advising us. The staff was rude and blamed it on US customs even after we told them we have 11 minutes. Then they advised that we couldn’t go through customs because our check bag was on our previous flight. We explained that they can send the bag at a later date because we have to get home to our kids. Note there are over 25 other people they denied as well. Also, other airlines sent our check bag at a later date of flights were running late. Furthermore, Air Canada did book our hotel rooms but did not state when we had to check out. So at 11am the next day we received a phone call that we have to check out. Our flight wasn’t due to arrive until 920pm. What were we supposed to do from 11am to at least 7 pm. With no winter clothes because we are coming from Jamaica and we didn’t have our clothes due to the checked bag being on the previous plane. We called several Air Canada customer service lines and we met with excuses. I will never fly Air Canada or will recommend this airline. We were warned but decided to try them out anyway.

I was running a little late for my flight and in the heat of it all, left one of my carry-ons at a security checkpoint for domestic departures. While I wasn’t able to get the item back the ground staff and cabin crew went above and beyond their fall of duty in helping me get it back. It didn’t work out in the end, but I appreciate the effort from contact numbers to the flight attendant that literally stepped off the plane to help me look.

They’re significantly wider than economy seats and closely resemble the regional business class product. The seats were comfortable and I managed to catch 6 hours of sleep on a 14 hour flight, but they a cosmetic refresh may be due, with slightly warped armrests and scratched glossy plastic seatbacks negatively impacting the aesthetics. IFE was touchscreen and remote controlled, though the touchscreen functions were somewhat unwieldy compared to economy class TVs.

They also have a chicken pesto ciabatta as a snack prior to landing and that was good too, chicken was tender and well seasoned. I would also note that typical of a North American airline, Air Canada does offer good coffee (Lavazza) even in regular economy, so that’s a plus. Overall, Air Canada has drastically improved their long haul product over the years, while maintaining fairly reasonable fares for international flights. As a full service airline, flying to Hong Kong, their most comparable competitor for the route is Cathay Pacific, of whom I have referenced regularly. Given a choice between the two, I would pick Air Canada for value, and surprisingly, food as well- they’re generally much cheaper and there seems to be better attention to detail with regards to food and beverage. On the other hand Cathay is still able to offer more convenient time slots and premium economy in their flights includes 3 checked bags, though typically at a significantly higher price, so who you do fly with definitely depends on your needs, but Air Canada is definitely a viable option to get you there.",True,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Vancouver to Hong Kong,May 2019,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",4,5,,True,4

When we arrived at the airport there is only one Air Canada counter and there were no staff present to check our bags. We waited for 45 minutes after having the airport page them for someone to show up. When the agent finally showed up and we questioned why we have to be here three hours before our flight but she wasn't here, her response was ""My schedule says I start at 9 take it up with my boss"". There is a sign on the counter that says an agent will only be present 3 hours before flight departure times which clearly was not the case. I emailed air Canada customer service twice regarding these issues and the first response was a generic canned response addressing the grounding of the Max 8 737, which did not address my concerns. I noticed through my trip, no matter the issue they were using that as the reason for everything. I originally asked for someone to call me which has still not happened and I have written a reply to their email which they have not responded to.

I fly anywhere between 8-12 time’s per year, and when I fly Air Canada I consistently regret booking my flight with their airline. Firstly, their email and real-time updating on multiple of my flights has been inefficient. Our return flight was delayed by 2 hours and they sent an email to update on this information an hour before the flight departure. By this time we are already in line to go through security. We discovered that the cause for delay was because the flight crew had a mandatory rest time of 8hrs (and their previous flight had been late the night before) this means that the information on the flight delay had been known by Air Canada for at least 8 hours prior to the scheduled flight and they informed passengers only one hour before flight departure. In addition, our first flight to our vacation destination was also delayed and we received no updates on this until siting at the gate wondering why our flight hadn’t started boarding yet. To make matters worse, they did not prove to meet their revised departure time. We actually took off even later than the revised departure time. In both circumstances the email to update was not sent at a time that would allow us to make other plans to accommodate their lack of integrity. Secondly, I was not happy with the service on the aircraft. The stewardesses seem to have a lack of communication between their fellow employees. As they collected garbage I handed the stewardess a disposable coffee cup that had been used as a make shift garbage bin (full of banana peel and other garbage) she took the cup from me, then instead of throwing it away she proceeded to hand the cup back to me and said I will come back for liquids, and turned before I could explain there was no liquid in the cup. I felt uncomfortable because I was in the middle seat and this whole scenario happened while passing garbage back and forth in front of the passenger next to me (a stranger). To add further frustration, the stewardess did not return to take the garbage. When a different stuardess passed by I asked her to please take my garbage she responded in a rude tone “we already collected garbage”, I explained that the previous stewardess said she would return and had not, her reply was “I’ll come back then” She did end up coming back for the garbage, greeting me with “your garbage?” And then aggressively snatched the cup from my hand and stormed away. I felt humiliated and disrespected. This disappointing service has been consistent on multiple Air Canada flights, so often that I have come to expect this kind of service when I fly Air Canada.

"""get rid of their new baggage fees""",7,2019-01-08,"I flew from Toronto to Geneva (with a stop in Montreal) on an A330 and returned to Toronto from London Heathrow on a Boeing 787-9. Air Canada has changed its economy class setup and now charges $60 each way to check in a suitcase on long-haul flights. This is by far my biggest gripe - one of the main reasons I choose to fly Air Canada is that the fare used to include all the essentials, unlike many of their competitors. Sadly, AC are starting to go down the nickle-and-diming route. Surely everybody who goes on a long transatlantic flight needs to check in a suitcase, so why not just include it in the airfare like before and spare everyone the hassle? This makes the online check-in process much longer and more cumbersome, as billing address and credit card info. all have to be entered as well as everything else. Very annoying and pesky. You also no longer get to choose a seat at the time of booking and instead have to wait to see what's available when checking in, though I wasn't too annoyed about that. Bag-drop at Toronto Pearson was fully self-service - I was even able to place the suitcase on the belt myself without any staff being present. The flight to Montreal and then on to Geneva was on time. Unlike on many newer aircraft, the older A330 has the advantage of having nice wide seats with excellent legroom and good seat cushioning. The IFE was okay but not quite as good in the newer cabins. Unfortunately I was seated in the middle of the aircraft by the washrooms, which was very bothersome on an overnight flight. The stopover in Montreal is a curious setup as I had to get off the plane, wait at the gate, and then get back on it into the same seat about 1.5 hours later. The cabin service was usual Air Canada - generous with the drinks, less so with the food. The pre-landing snack of a small slice of banana bread was inadequate. The return flight on the very new 787-9 was pleasant - the seats were not as narrow or as firm as I feared they might be. The IFE was better than on the older A330, though still not as good as some other airlines'. Cabin service was the usual - pleasant enough. On both flights, the captain and first officer stood with the cabin crew to say goodbye as passengers disembarked, which I thought was a very nice little touch. Arrival at Toronto Pearson airport was the usual complete disaster - we had to sit for over an hour until a gate opened up, and then they couldn't get the bridge to fit properly. And the usual pandemonium at the baggage reclaim, but none of this was AC's fault. Overall, perfectly pleasant flights and very glad that AC has finally got rid of their ancient 767s!

Our trip originated in Prague with the first leg operated by Brussels Airlines so upon landing in Brussels we proceeded to the lounge. AC uses Brussels Airlines lounge which was very crowded and had very limited food and drink options. We proceeded to the gate 30 minutes before boarding time and were met with a long queue for passport verification. When I went up to the counter to inquire if there were a separate line for business class passengers the agent simply responded by saying there was only one line and pointed to the back of it. We had somewhere in the neighbourhood of 150 passengers ahead of us and there were only two ground agents performing the checks. After 20 minutes in the line I went up again and asked why they did not have a dedicated line for premium passengers like they do at every other European airport. In a rather sarcastic tone the agent simply said “this is how we do it in Brussels”. We finally got through the line at which time I spotted the AC Concierge and immediately questioned him about the process only to be told that they do have a dedicated line for premium passengers. At this point I was getting quite agitated and asked him why it was not in effect that day. To that he simply said he did not know. We then went into the priority boarding line which was a joke as there had to be 100 people in the line. Finally the agents announced start of boarding but instead called for those in zones 3 and 4 ahead of the priority passengers. At this point the boarding became a free for all and resembled those you would see in third world airports. On board the service was great but the hard product was showing its age. Food was quite tasty but they had no red wine as they simply had not loaded enough on the inbound trip from Montreal. IFE has a reasonable selection and before landing we were served another meal which was also very tasty.

I was assigned a seat I did not fit into because the arm rests would not go up on this premium seat. The plane was full and no other seats could be given. My mother also had a seat whose arm rests would not go up but being smaller it was not an issue for her even though these were premium seats.

We were in row 45 which was the last row in Zone 3 with very little leg room. I had to take the middle seat since the window was too tight for me and the arm rest in the aisle would not go up. The flight attendant said there was definitely an error on the seats assigned and she made me follow her to the gate agent to see if anything could be done.

When we finally boarded we were not told we were to land first in St John's Canada to have a pilot change. They should have left us in Paris and resume normal schedules hours albeit a day late,  yet to add to this when the flight left St John's to arrive in Toronto, we were met at the Toronto airport by gate agents ready with hotel vouchers and new boarding passes for a flight to LAX the day after.

I went to the hotel where the shuttle took over an hour to arrive to pick us up after several calls to the front desk letting them know we were waiting (you would think the airline would have this a little more coordinated). Well by the time I got to the hotel it was midnight and I had to get up by 5:00 AM to catch the flight from Toronto to Los Angeles. Arriving at the airport at 5:45 AM I was told the flight to Los Angeles was delayed by one hour and 45 minutes so instead of leaving at 8:05 AM the flight now left at 9:45 AM.

So I purchased an economy fare, Then I attempted to bid for an upgrade, I bid $2250, one way for an upgrade, that meant I would have paid $3250, one way. Initially Air Canada’s bid, as in it is a slider, was $3250, I moved the slider down to the lowest I could bid, coming up with $2250, one way. I received an email saying my bid was unsuccessful. So imagine my surprise to find empty seats in Business Class. So instead I purchase lounge access, which I paid fifty dollars. And got to use in Toronto. I found Air Canada’s lounge food is rubbish.

The guy that answered told me there were no other flights for the day that would get me back to Austin and he asked me if I could travel tomorrow (as if I had a choice in the matter). I had paid for premium seats on my initial flights (sounds as though I am out that money). He put me on hold as he booked me for the following day flights (I was on hold at least 20 minutes). During this time I booked a nearby hotel for the night because the pamphlet I was given said the airline would not be responsible for costs related to travel interruptions because it was beyond their control. I went back to the gate agent. Told her after 1.5 hours on the phone that I had been re-booked for tomorrow and asked her about getting my luggage back.

The seats were a little more comfortable than those on Premium Rouge with perhaps a little more leg room. As this service departed DUB early afternoon, lunch was serviced not long after departure. There were 2 choices for the main course and the meal was serviced on china ware. No so the drinks with plastic glasses, (apart form a wine glass on the meal tray!) and coffee/tea from paper cups. This is a downgrade from Rouge PE where real glasses and china mugs for coffee/tea are used. The second meal or snack was exactly the same as offered in Premium Rouge. A significant difference was the lack of a dedicated FA to PE. FAs in PE are shared with Economy, with Economy being a much larger cabin, at times there was no FA to be seen in PE. With Rouge PE there is dedicated FA at all times. Another difference is that the FAs on main-line are more mature, and for the most part more experienced.

There were two other flights that could have gotten me to Shanghai in time for my meeting. Due to the incompetence of the Air Canada staff I missed both. In particular, there is no Business Class line at the re-ticketing counter. I waited for an hour and a half – missing both other flight options. I was behind domestic travelers with multiple rerouting options and coach fares. Even when I called over a “supervisor” and explained the situation I was told there was nothing she could do, she couldn’t get me to the front of the line, and I would just have to wait my turn. I was going for a board meeting, with my executive team flying in from all over the world for this meeting. All other travel and arrangements – for all of the other people – needed to be rearranged due to my travel issues. I am a frequent Air Canada traveler. I go to Asia at a minimum twice a year in Business Class. I fly every other week on an expensive (typically $500) ticket to my other office domestically.

My experience with customer service just added insult to injury. I am taking the time to write this review on as many review sites as I can. I don’t typically write reviews. In this case, however, I really want to warn other business travelers – in particular overseas business travelers – that they are not at all equipped to handle the inevitable travel disruptions and prioritize business class tickets.

We bid online for a cash upgrade and initially had money taken from our credit card only to have it returned to our account within hours. A request at the gate in Toronto for a seat change on either leg was answered with ""ask in Vancouver"". An on time departure but a poor meal service. Neither my partner or I got our choice of meal. A very average stew of veal was provided followed by drinks. On spotting an IPA ale on the cart appearing from club, I was told the IPA was a premium beer and not available in PPremium Economy. The service just feels ill thought out with a meal before a drink! At Vancouver, we were told we couldn't swap seats as we should have asked in Toronto! My partner was initially upgraded for free to biz as Premium Economy and Economy were over-sold which was then withdrawn when a connecting flight ran late and all classes suddenly available. Another average ""slop meal"" followed by drinks followed served by a very capable and very senior crew. After this alleged enhanced meal, service morphed into Economy with standard mid flight sandwich and an inedible breakfast. A late arrival was followed by late bags.

The attendant came around in good time and offered more wine to the cabin without people even asking. When I missed the second meal (breakfast wraps) because I was asleep, the attendant brought me two servings to make up for it. When I asked for coffee, the attendant brought a handful of something, saying: 'I didn't know if you wanted sugar-and-cream or Baileys, so I brought both - choose wisely! I chose wisely and went with Baileys - and I'll choose Air Canada again because believe it or not, this kind of service and friendliness is pretty typical on most flights, and I've flown with them on countless times.

However, on getting there, we discover that we still have to go through Canadian customs and so needed the Canadian form too. We then had to get to a waiting area for our bags to come off the Air Canada flight and go through to US customs. On the airplane and by several signs in the terminal not to pick up our bag for customs; it would go directly through. My bag took 2 hours to get to where it needed to go and my companion’s bag was lost. So, naturally, at this point we can’t get to our next flight because US customs requires your checked bag to be accounted for first. So, we missed our next flight. It’s a busy time of year so no other flights were available for two days. We go to the counter to get a hotel since it’s their fault we couldn’t continue on our trip. We’re told by one employee to go talk to another, who gives us the phone number of their help line. I spend half an hour on hold waiting to talk to them only to be told they can’t do hotel vouchers over the phone and I have to talk to someone in the terminal. We finally get our hotel, but they’ll only book it for one night because their policy is we have to try again tomorrow to get rebooked on an earlier flight.

They mentioned that another crew was scheduled to work the flight we were on but were delayed so they were working on a 12 hour day. No snacks were offered, only water, coffee and juice. Staff was pleasant, in cabin entertainment was working. 11:40 - We approached San Diego to learn we had to divert to LAX due to fog.

Not a big deal but just fed the flames of frustration people were feeling.) We were encouraged that an Air Canada staffer would meet us at the luggage carousel to advise us of our compensation / options.

Options for dinner were Chicken or Beef with vegetables and potatoes. I chose chicken which was average for airplane food (Picture attached). I then browsed the entertainment selection with a post dinner drink. The entertainment had 100's of different films and sitcom option, however none had appealed to me at the time and I was fairly tired so I ended up not watching anything. The best part of the flight was the seat comfort. After dinner I put some earplugs in and went to sleep. I ended up falling asleep for a good 6 hours at which time I woke up and tried the entertainment system again to no avail, at which point I fell back asleep for a few more hours. I did have an exit row which meant I did have extra legroom, however lots of people congregate there to use the washroom that is in the centre row.

My partner and I were returning from a trip from Asia, a 15 hour flight. We were to get a connecting flight in EWR with Air Canada and return to YYZ at 6pm. We made it to EWR with plenty of time to spare and as we were in line to check our baggage, we get a notification that the flight had been cancelled with no further information. There was an AC employee in the area and we asked her about the cancelled flight, she mentioned in passing that the flight got cancelled all the time but we needed to stand in the assistance line to figure out what to do next. We got in line and there was only one rep dealing with an entire cancelled flight. One would think that if a flight gets cancelled, the company would bring on more staff. So, after waiting in line for nearly 2 hours, mind you there were only 4 or 5 people ahead of us, we finally got to the rep, who was incredibly dismissive and borderline rude to us. We were told that because of weather, the flight was cancelled, no other information other than that. I can accept weather can cancel a flight but based on our experiences and the information I found, I suspect we were being lied to. I asked if there was any other information and all I got was a blunt 'No'. All they could do would be to put us on standby for a flight at 9.35pm and we would have no idea if we could get on that or not. If that failed, the next flight we could be on was 8.35am the next day. When I asked if there were any other airlines that AC could put us on, a blunt 'No'. When I asked if AC would put us up in a hotel, another blunt 'No'. When asked if there was any compensation, he blurted out 'nope' in almost a happy way. Absolutely horrible customer service. My partner has priority pass, so we thought we could wait in the AC lounge. We showed up at the lounge, tried to get in, the rep there informed us in a way that he almost seemed to take pleasure from, that the lounge was only open to priority pass members until 3pm. The next flight, ended up getting delayed, we asked the rep at the counter a couple times if there was any status on the standby list, the last time we asked, which was close to 11pm, they told us they would tell us in two minutes, 30 seconds later they called out at list of names, didn't explain what it was and left us completely in the dark. It turns out that everybody that was on standby, except for us got a seat on the plan. When I went up to ask what was going on, they told me that the plane was full, maybe, just maybe if we waited a little while longer, we might be able to get on. It turns out there was another couple waiting on standby that had already been bumped 4 times before us that day. We waited until probably around 11.30pm. The rep found that two people hadn't checked in so we did have seats! He rushed us on board and we got into the first two seats that were available, they happened to be in business class. They seemed a bit confused at first and then realised that the tickets were for seats in economy, the first rep told us not to worry about it but then this horribly unfriendly flight attendant came up to us and told us that we we would have to move. We said okay, grabbed our belongings quickly and started to look for our seats, at this time the flight attendant yells out at us 'just take your seat, we'll sort it out in the air' - well that's great, she is the one that forced us to move, meanwhile embarrassing us in front of everybody in the plane.

I went ahead to check us in and unsuccessfully an error receipt came out. I was forced to go into the check in line which had a wait time of 35 min. We got to the front of the line and found out that the flight was over booked and they wanted to put us on the next flight out. I was livid - how could they overbook the flight that we paid for? The Air Canada representative also had the audacity to mention that we were running late. After I firmly mentioned that I cannot get on the next flight, they magically found two seats right by one another. A miracle really. On my way from Montreal to Vancouver, I also did not have a pleasant experience. I had one carry on luggage. The front desk staff at the gate came specifically to me and asked to check it in for no charge because they had a full flight, and not enough space for the carry on luggage. I had some personal belongings that I wanted to carry on board, and in addition, I wanted to forego waiting for the checked in baggage to arrive in Vancouver.

"""enormous lack of care shown by flight attendants""",2,2017-07-26,"✅ Verified Review |  I understand all of the negative reviews regarding the seat layout of 3-4-3. However, I recognize that the flight crew have no control over this. However, what I don't get is the enormous lack of care shown by flight attendants that constantly bump into aisle seat passengers as they move up and down the cabin. Facts: 1) Took AC5 from Toronto to Tokyo with my family on July 2nd, 2017. Returned on from Tokyo to Toronto on Flight AC6 - July 23rd, 2017. Both times we were seated in Aisle 41. My two kids had the window and centre seats, my wife had the aisle seat next to them, and I had the aisle next to my wife's, as we were divided by the pathway that people take up and down the cabin. 2) My elbow rested on the armrest no different than any other passengers in the cabin. To ensure true obectivity, my body size, position and posture made absoltutey no difference, as (when the issue persisted) I studied in depth whether or not I may have been the problem. My findings were that my shoulder, arm and elbow did not extend beyond the armrest as much as a millimeter further than any of the other passengers seated in the first few rows ahead, as well as behind me. 3) I cannot count the exact amount of times when the attendants banged into me when they walked past, either with or without their walking carts - forwards or backwards. What I can tell you however, is that it occurred about 15-20 times on both flights. In fact, there may have been only about 3 occasions where I no contact was made when they walking by. Some of the incidents involved them ""brushing"" along me - easily enough to wake someone uo who is sleeping. Other incidents were downright collisions - where their buttocks banged into my arm as they walked in reversed with their carts. Passengers going to and from the washroom managed to avoid these incidents. 4) Not one apology or even acknowledgement that they banged into me, or my wife, or two other passengers in the rows ahead of us that were equally annoyed. I can't speak further passengers throughout the cabin. No effort was made by the attendants to exercise the slightest bit of caution or consideration towards me, my wife and two other passengers (one being a petite female - no more than 110 pounds). There is no possible way the attendants could not feel the sensation of colliding with other passengers, yet they clearly chose not to react or respond. It's as if they have given up due to the narrow walkway layout they have been given to work with, and are almost making a statement that there was nothing that could be done about it. 4) During our vacation, we took four domestic flights within Japan via ANA Airlines. The walking path provided to their flight attendants differed minimally (if at all), yet their crew managed to make every effort to not disturb their passengers as they made their way up and down the aisles throughout the flights. In fact, there were no incidents. Their standards were much higher, and they truly went the extra mile to ensure that passengers were comfortable and well taken care of. 5) I'm a reasonable person and don't feel the need ""Go to town"" on every ratable indicator about my flight experience (i.e. food, seat comfort, in-flight entertainment), but the lack of care, effort and empathy regarding this particular matter was enough to turn me off from this airline.

Granted this is a short flight of about 1.5 hours but I expected more from a global airline such as this. Generally, I don't rush to board early because my luggage is usually checked. Also, boarding early just means I have to sit and wait longer as everyone slowly boards the plane and settles into their seats. Air Canada groups zones 1 and 2 together for one queue and 3 and 4 together in the other queue. Needless to say, this is very inefficient and confusing because people in zone 2 are standing on the line (early, mind you) waiting to board mixed in with zone 1 (business class) passengers. When they started boarding, some people just stood there and didn't move. That's because they were zone 2. So zone 1 passengers had to ask the person in front of them if they were moving or not and then proceed to walk ahead of them if they were zone 2. The boarding process is very backwards and makes no sense. After about 15 minutes, I was ready to board. The gate agent scanning tickets of passengers had his back to the queues. Which meant he would not see me if I walked up to the zone 1 and 2 queue. So I wound up standing in line with the zone 3 and 4 passengers. On other airlines, I would be able to walk right up and the gate agents would see me and take me right away because they would be facing the queues. Once onboard, I took my seat. And waited at least 10 minutes before a flight attendant asked me if I wanted something to drink. The FA working the business class section was standing by the door and greeting passengers with another FA, completely oblivious to the fact that I had just taken the last seat in business class. Shouldn't her focus be on the business class passengers? For this short trip, all they offered was a ""snack"" consisting of a slice of cheese and various cold cut meats. The flight departed at 11:05 am and was expected to land at 12:40 pm. I was expecting some kind of a light lunch, not light snack. The return flight was a complete mess whereby they checked me in ""so quickly"" that the systems didn't have enough time to catch up with the immigration system. Being a Global Entry customer, I was turned away by a US Immigrations Officer and asked to go sit in a waiting area so that my flight check in information would ""catch up"" with the other systems. I sat in this room nearby waiting for my name to pop up on a screen. It never happened because an Air Canada employee who directed me to this room remembered me and asked to see my ticket. I gave it to her and she scanned it on one of their machines. And I was cleared.

I have no issues with the plane or service on that flight. My issue came in trying to go from Vancouver to Denver. At the last minute Air Canada cancelled our flight. Okay fine. Things happen. (There was no issue with weather in this case.) I'm not upset that the flight was cancelled. I'm upset at how it was handled by airline representatives. First of all, there is no customer service counter for the airline in this part of Vancouver airport, so the entire flight is waiting in a giant line for a mere two representatives to help us rebook. Second, they start handing out a phone number because they said it was faster for us to rebook if we called this number. This is true, and I did call. However, why are they making already frazzled customers do this? Shouldn't they just employ enough agents to handle this sort of thing? As a side note, when I called the number the woman on the phone was very nice and helpful and took the time to answer all my questions.  Third, did my rebooking over the phone, and the agent was very helpful. However, she can't issue me a boarding pass or check me in over the phone. I have to see an agent. She assured me that my baggage would follow me, perhaps not on that same flight, but eventually. I'm on my way home, so I'm okay with this. Fourth, I try to see said agent. If I can get a new boarding pass with enough time, perhaps I can get go get my baggage and get it retagged myself. I have no such luck. I can find 3 Air Canada reps in the entire airport (or at least the part I have access to without going through US customs again.) All 3 are trying to help with rebooking. I wait in line while my husband wanders the airport looking for a person or a kiosk or anything. He finds nothing.  This is where my issue is. The woman trying to rebook everyone literally will not even let me finish a sentence. She says I have to go get my baggage and go through customs again with it retagged. When I tell her that the agent told me over the phone that I would not have to do this, she rolls her eyes and prints me one boarding pass. I need two boarding passes. You see, our new flight was from Vancouver to Seattle and then from Seattle to Denver. The final Seattle to Denver leg was on another airline. She refuses to print me that boarding pass and sends me away with a wave of her hand and will not answer any more questions.  I go to the gate where we are supposed to take off from Vancouver to Seattle. This agent also will not print me another boarding pass.

Me: Okay well - Agent: Sit down and I'll page you. (Not sure how she was going to page me without asking my name but what do I know right?) She pages customers being bumped to the next flight. They are unhappy naturally. She is just as snippy with them, not letting anyone finish a sentence. We do make the flight and eventually get home over 6 hours late. We have no bags.

Flew from Toronto to London Heathrow / Geneva. The check-in/bag drop at Pearson was terrible. I arrived 2.5 hours before the flight and there was a long line that barely moved. It took an hour before I got to a desk. Typical case of lots of desks available but less than half were being used. Not acceptable for a full long-haul flight. The aircraft to London was a B777.

The catering is standard and decent enough, certainly better than AC Rouge, BA or Air Transat these days. Lots of water runs throughout the flight, which were appreciated. My return flight was from Geneva on an older A330. Overall this was a good thing: the seats were wider and more comfortable, with proper cushioning and excellent leg-room. The IFE system was dated, though, and the selection not as good, but still adequate. The catering was again decent enough. All in all I would fly Air Canada again to Europe for direct flights.

Of course we hadn’t checked in, because the original flight Air Canada had us on was late. So we tried to get back on the original flight. Luckily they got us on. However, they had already moved our bags to the following flight leaving out of Toronto. So they had to move our bags back. They said they would get a runner to do it. Fair enough. When we landed in LHR (London), they didn’t have our bags. We went to the baggage claim desk for Air Canada. They said they had no scans on our bags and had no idea where they were. They asked us to file a claim and track it through your World Tracer program. This trip was becoming a nightmare. Because the flight was delayed in Toronto the flight to LHR landed late. This made us miss our original flight to Munich that we had made on Lufthansa. We went to the Lufthansa desk who said it would be $271.00 for each of us to get a new flight. Still no update on the baggage tracer. Kept calling their baggage claim desk, and they said the bags hadn’t arrived on the recent flight coming in from Toronto.

Having sampled Premium economy on Air France on a trip to Paris last year and having had an excellent experience, I was truly disappointed at the sub-par product Air Canada offers in comparison to the return trip I just took to Brussels from Montreal. I flew on an A330. The seat comfort is mediocre with little space to manoeuvre and if the person in front of you decides to recline their chair, it's game over. Sleep was impossible because of malfunctioning closet door near the galley that kept opening in spite of the attendant's very noisy attempts to close it permanently. On the outbound I was served a veal stew which was ok though truthfully it could have been any meat thanks to the heavy sauce. Breakfast was literally a slice of grey bread wrapped in plastic which I declined. Out of Brussels, nothing is more infuriating than sitting in a half empty Premium economy cabin (AC833 27/5/17) after having been told that the flight was full (both economy cabins evidenced many empty seats after take-off) and being told before take-off that your food choice is no longer available thereby compromising the principle of not getting what you pay for.

But that's all fine, what I am upset about is the fact I had to take a flight to Montreal at 8:50pm and have a lay over there until 7:40 am. I was expecting hotel to be covered but unfortunately it was not technically their fault. They also neglected to tell us that technically the Air Canada ticket counter was closed until 4a.m. So we had to ""sleep"" in the outer lobby where any one could have access to steal our stuff. Needless to say we did not sleep at all and waited till 4am to come into the airport.

"""no staff at the airport to help""",2,2017-05-07,"✅ Verified Review | I've had the worst time flying with Air Canada from Toronto to Vancouver. First out flight was delayed, then the gate was changed and eventually it was canceled. Over 200 people had to stay in the airport overnight, service of the airline was extremely bad and intentionally slow. Our flight was scheduled 11 hours later, 6 of those hours I've spent in the lines to get a food voucher, collect my baggage, register on the new flight, go through customs twice. There was no staff at the airport to help, and impossible to get any answers. On the new flight, which was over 5 hours long, there were no free meals or even snack. So starving people had to pay to get some food. Airline provided 20$ food voucher per person, that's how much money I had to feed myself for over 10 hours.

"""passed from desk to desk""",1,2017-05-07,"✅ Verified Review |  
Air Canada is easily able to provide one of the worst experiences to travellers of any airline. Their inability to manage delays and cancellations astounds me since it's such a regular thing for them. Yesterday most of their domestic flights from Toronto were cancelled due to a known outage of one runway, and most of their international flights were delayed. Despite knowing this it was chaos. I was incorrectly passed from desk to desk when I arrived late to a cancelled flight. Each person sent me to someone else or lied to me. Eventually I ended up outside of security with no luggage, no transport to my destination no luggage and no one who could give me any help or information. Every agent I dealt with lied to me to get me to go away and there was no joined up process for dealing with numeesous stranded passengers. The only helpful person was the woman at the delayed baggage call centre who had empathy, knowledge and genuinely helped me try to resolve my situation.

The aircraft is amazing if not for one thing: the entertainment system has a fundamental flaw. On screen controlls are nice, but also controls have been aded on the armrest. Consequently, any arm on top or near it sets off the screen, volume, light, calls the attendant and so on. The only solution was to not rest the arm period. Does not work.

"""Air Canada's horrible service""",1,2017-05-05,"✅ Verified Review |  Honolulu to Deer Lake via Vancouver. My family's wonderful Hawaii trip had a very upsetting ending due to Air Canada's horrible service. We endured multiple flight delays and cancellations due to technical issues with their planes and had to pay for three hotel rooms out of pocket to accommodate our 8-month old baby and my elderly parents who would have been stranded overnight in two separate cities. It took us 2+ days to get back home (instead of the scheduled 23 hours). Our returning flight AC1830 was delayed due to technical issues. We found out about the delay when we arrived at the airport around 7:00 pm (no previous warning) and the departure was initially postponed from 10:00 pm to 3:45 am but got delayed again to 4:15 am early in the morning. AC told us that since they didn't cancel the flight they were not responsible to book us a hotel room despite the fact that we had an infant and two seniors travelling with us. I couldn't understand how AC expected families with small children and babies to deal with this - sleep on the airport floor? We decided to book a hotel room on our own since we have 20+ hours flight ahead of us and an infant baby travelling with us. A motel room with airport shuttle cost us $200+tax USD/room due to the last minute booking. AC did postpone the departure again from 3:45 to 4:15 am. Neither my husband nor I was able to sleep well as we were afraid to miss our flight. This was only the beginning of our horrible experience. We were supposed to have two connecting flights after arriving in Vancouver (VAN-TOR, TOR-DL). Due to this first delay, AC had to cancel our subsequent flights and rebook the rest of our trip. Instead of flying to Deer Lake on the same night we arrived in Toronto, we had to stay in Toronto overnight. However, AC couldn't give us the rest of our boarding passes, nor could it book a hotel in Toronto for us. The agent in Honolulu told us that we needed to get the hotel from AC's customer service in Toronto once we got there. AC's flight from Vancouver to Toronto got delayed again and the plane did not land in Toronto airport until 10:45 pm on May 2nd. By the time we got off the plane it was almost 11:30pm. There were 50+ people in line at the AC customer service kiosk, while only two to three agents were working. The line hardly moved and after midnight an agent came to the line telling us all the hotels around the airport were sold out and we had to look for hotels on our own. He said the desk would be closing in 30 minutes and the agents would leave despite there were still so many of us unserved. He told us to call AC to rebook our flights. He also told us to find hotel on our own; and AC will reimburse up to $100 CAD per room. Seriously, I want to ask AC where to find a hotel room cost $100 or less nowadays?? As we learned that we wouldn't be helped by anyone at the desk, my husband started to call AC about our booking and I started looking for hotel rooms for us since we were all exhausted and I did not want my super-exhausted baby to sleep on the floor in the airport. As it was after midnight already, I couldn't book a room on Expedia or other online booking website as they couldn't take May 2nd as the check-in date. Therefore I started calling every hotel around the airport. Finally a hotel had two rooms available and they cost us $169+taxes although the regular online booking price is no more than $128, thanks to AC for causing the last min booking.",False,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Deer Lake via Vancouver,May 2017,1,3,,1,1,,False,
"""never flying with them again""",1,2017-05-04,"✅ Verified Review |  Air Canada was horrible, first they changed my flight schedule without even letting me know (they rebooked me on a flight from Havana to Frankfurt via Toronto to Amsterdam instead of Toronto straight to Amsterdam, without notifying me) and if I wouldn't have checked myself I would have missed these flights. And when I called about this they put me on another flight, with an excuse about the flight that was very vague and when I looked it up it turned out they told me a very different reason. When I arrived at Schiphol at the day of my departure I suddenly had to pay for my bag as it was not included in their system (while it was on my ticket), so I had to pay 95 euros for a service that I bought when I booked (On the Air Canada site). And when I wanted to check-in for the flight in Havana they couldn't put me on a seat, and I had to wait until 20 minutes before the flight before even knowing if I had a seat. While flying their in-flight system kept failing and turning on again, so I've watched the beginning from my movie for at least 4 times..

It's the only airline that has a direct flight Toronto to Indianapolis and never has it ever been on time (12+ flights) and is always late. Not just a few minutes but hours! The 8.50pm usually leaves at 10.30pm. Air Canada do us all a favor and at least be honest with your posted take off times so when new passengers pay your fees for a ticket they know it's not leaving till 10.30pm (and that's the earliest I've ever taken off for the 8.50 flight).,False,,Business,Economy Class,Toronto to Indianapolis,April 2017,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,False,1
