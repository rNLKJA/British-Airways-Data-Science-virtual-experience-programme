"""would highly recommend""",10,2019-12-18,We flew from Liberia to San Jose. This was an incredibly easy flight! We left exactly in time and arrived a few minutes early in San Jose.

"""Avoid this airline""",1,2019-04-23,"Not Verified |  Quepos to San Jose. Well, my family and I were suppose to fly with Sansa, but after waiting at the airport for a while we were told the flight was cancelled and there were no other flights for us. The counter person said we would be refunded our ticket price. However, when I inquired with the airline several days later I was simply told that they do not give refunds, even when they cancel a flight. Avoid this airline.",False,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Quepos to San Jose,April 2019,,,,1,1,,False,
"""Refuses to refund me""",1,2018-12-03,"Refuses to refund me, do not trust this airline. Sansa was supposed to refund me for a canceled flight almost 2 months ago. I still have not received the refund. I email and no one responds. No one can explain to me why I haven't received a refund yet. It does not take this long to return me half of the money I paid for. Please avoid this airline at all cost. They are not worth it. There are other ways of getting around Costa Rica to which you can avoid this airline",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Jose to Tambor,September 2018,,,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,False,1
