"""Air Tanzania is not a reliable airline""",1,2022-10-10,Air Tanzania delayed the flight from Mtwara to Dar last Friday by 4 hours. I missed my connecting flight to Doha. On coming Wednesday you are delaying the flight again by 4 hours. Again I miss my rescheduled flight. Rescheduling costs us >USD $400. This is not acceptable. I will never again buy an Air Tanzania ticket. I will also warn my fellow travellers not to use Air Tanzania because Air Tanzania is not a reliable airline. You can not just fly when you feel like it and take money from trusting clients for such poor service. Never again!,True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mtwara to Dar,October 2022,1,1,,1,1,,False,
"""Never again will I take Air Tanzania""",1,2022-09-26,"Sorry - Air TZ email and ticketing info is the worst, and staff tries to blame it on you. If I could give negative 10 stars for the stress caused by this trip, I would. Sorry, another story about bad customer service and Air TZ. My friend and I both booked tickets and came to the terminal in the Jomo Kenyatta Airport (Nairobi) marked for Air TZ departures. However, after getting through security, we were told it was the wrong terminal. By the time we got to the correct one, the checkin gate was closed. And although there was time, we were told the flight was ready to go. They left 20 minutes early with 4 missing passengers. Wondering how we could have not gotten the right terminal, we looked over all communication we had gotten from Air TZ. There was no terminal, gate, or seat information, and only boarding time was listed. Also, when we tried to checkin online the night before and that morning, the website was full of processing errors and we each only had the tickets for the second leg of our two leg journey issued. On going to the local Nairobi office to rebook, they insisted we would have to pay a change fee. One of us had booked through a third party, and they blamed the poor email communication on that, even though all ticketing information we received from Air TZ directly looked the same for both of us. The worst thing is that local staff lied and said no other passengers had missed the flight and refused to call the airport to see if the signage was actually mismarked for the terminal! They said it was our responsibility to call customer service if we couldn't find terminal and gate information on our tickets. I pointed out that it was impossible they expect every passenger to do so. They also said it was standard to arrive 3 hours early for international flights, and if we had done so, we would have not missed it. Really? 3 hours early for a 2 hour flight? Having taken a 13 hour flight a few weeks prior, that airline only required us to show up 90 minutes early. So they want us to show up 3 hours ahead because of their poor communication and they are allowed to leave 20 minutes early? Lastly, when we were issued tickets for the rebooked departure - which we had to pay for, in addition to forfeiting our vacation hotel booking that night - all the information that was missing before was also missing on these tickets.

I used them from Lusaka to Nairobi via Daresalaam on 4th September Flight 212 from Lusaka to Dar was delayed by 2 hrs ostensibly due to technical challenges which necessitated a plane change, then flight 202 from Dar to Nbi was also held up for 2 more hours while they sorted out scheduling conflicts arising from the delays, with some passengers waiting on the plane, others in the airport waiting area and yet others in the airport bus. At one point they also ran out of stationery to print boarding passes. No cogent apologies or explanations were given by the ground staff, though the Captain at some point apologized but tried to put the blame on distant Kenyan authorities.

"""I could not check-in without it""",5,2021-11-03,"I traveled last evening 1st Nov from Dar to Mumbai. It was a tight schedule since I came from Arusha and had to take this 1 hr later connecting flight at 19.50 to Mumbai TC 2400 . Within an hour, I had to get my bags from the domestic terminal to the international and do the rest of the process to be on my flight back home. When I came to the counter, I was asked for my Air Suvidha Form. Unfortunately I wasn't aware and the man behind said I could not check-in without it. At this time I had all my documents ready - both Vaccines done in India, a local covid test done at Arusha a few hrs before the flight. I showed the man behind the counter and he refused to move forward, saying I could not leave without the Air Suvidha form duly filled online (I don't know how important this form was since no one from here on asked me for the form - neither in the airport at Dar nor in Mumbai). He promptly directed me to 2 Tanzanian Airline employees and they in a very rude tone told me they could do it but it was not for free. They demanded 50,000 Tanzanian to fill the form for me and I reluctantly paid . Meanwhile I called me agent who booked the ticket for me and she too got on to the job of filling this online form. The counter was kept open since this process was on and the ladies signaled to the counter guy, probably indicating that the deal is done and they are on the job. I'm not too sure if the counter staff is a part of this racket, but I'm convinced that he is aware. If I had chosen to do this with my agent, they would have closed the counter on me, I say this cause they already told me the counter is closed and my time was up and I had to miss my flight when I first came to check in - the deal with the Tanzanian lady staff kept the counter open for me. Finally my agent filled the form and sent me the completed form before these ladies could do it. I showed it to them and they confirmed it was ok and asked me to go to the counter. The rest is standard process. No one asked me for the form. I got into the flight which was delayed for more than ½hr. The ladies didn't return my money even though they didn't do the job (that was expected considering the greed and the language they used in my brief conversation with them ).

"""regret to have travelled with Air Tanzania""",2,2020-10-06,"On August 10, 2020 we were scheduled to take flight TC 105 from JRO to ZNZ, this was a confirmed flight. We were planning to start our vacation stay on Zanzibar on August 10, 2020. Since our original flight has been cancelled (or changed, or had been wrongly advertised from the beginning) we had to postpone resp. had to shorten our stay for one full day (we took flight TC 137 on August 11, 2020, instead). This incurred costs on Zanzibar for at least our hotel (126 US dollars). I wrote to and received some initial response from your incidence handling team. But in the end there was no answer of any substance at all. There was some redundant email correspondence where one person from Air Tanzania haphazardly tried to make another person take some action (which action remained unclear). What I wanted was an explanation, an apology (for ruining one day of our holidays that we spent in lovely Tanzania in spite of the troubles we went to be able to travel abroad at all at these difficult times), and US$126 for the day we could not spend at Zanzibar (but had to pay for anyway) but instead at the miserable hotel near the airport.  It only remains to express my severe regret to have travelled with Air Tanzania. I also think of their customer complaint handling as being quite unprofessional. When I tried to use the contact form on the Air Tanzania website it turned out to be unusable because it would not send my text. Then I tried to contact [email protected] with the same text.

As I have not been able to take this flight, my review covers customer service and booking issues with Air Tanzania. In November 2019 I booked two return flights with Air Tanzania. On receiving the e tickets, I noticed that my surname had been duplicated, thus rendering the ticket invalid. I immediately contacted the airline, via their on line contact page and a further email as back up. To date, I have received no response from the airline. I know that my emails have been received because the Air Tanzania sales office in Mumbai were copied in and have acknowledged receipt. I have made an official complaint, even copying in the Tanzanian Ministry of Transport who have overall responsibility for the airline. Once again, no response. I have thus been forced to cancel the tickets, which apparently are not refundable.
