As my check in baggage weight exceeded the 15kg free allowance as I had extra luggage packed, I was made to pay around 375 Rs for every extra kg and the staff there were generous enough to waive off 1 kg extra in exchange for a South Indian breakfast on the flight which was reasonable enough. The boarding started on time and there was some nice funky boarding music being played and the seats were comfortable enough although on longer duration trips, it could be uncomfortable. The flight departed on time and even though the flight was full, the crew were very nice and after takeoff I even got the South Indian breakfast which consisted of an idli, medu vada with sambhaar and upma. The meal was decent enough although if one has to purchase this directly in-flight, it was quite pricey at around 350 INR and maybe the quantity does not justify the price. But then again, low cost carriers aren't exactly known for being generous when it comes to inflight food and beverages. Landing was on time and retrieval of the baggage was also swift. I would say that the flight was quite nice and even though low cost carriers try to maximize revenue through ancillary services (meals / excess baggage) they provide the best functional experience when it comes to taking you from point A to point B.

"""paying almost nothing for the tickets""",1,2017-02-23,"✅ Verified Review |  Goa to Bangalore. AirAsia lures you in with the dirt cheap prices, but it may not be worth the trouble. We have an infant.  The flight was delayed 2:30 hrs and no SMS or call. We get there on time for the original takeoff and we are received by belligerent employees. They have no clue about what is to follow and are passing that irritation on to us. Truly the worst experience with ground staff. No customer service or information.

I called customer care they demanded seat charges for putting all of us in the same row. I refused to pay and not chose not to continue with the Web check-in. At the airport I again asked AirAsia about getting us in a row as a family travelling together. They refused and said they can't do this without additional money. To my utter surprise, the flight was only about 70% occupy and I found the third seat in my row was empty.

I really panicked because I had to reach Bangalore the next day. I went and talked to the staff on duty and they were really cooperative and they gave me 15 minutes to search for my boarding pass on the airport. They also copied everybody via radio regarding the missing boarding pass. While I was searching for the pass I got a call from officer on duty and he stated that they had found my boarding pass.

Staff on board were friendly and seemed to giggle and laugh a lot. Nice crew, but seemingly not fussed about procedures and information to be given to passengers. Food (that you buy) was mediocre.

Later as the flight Bangalore-Pune was not full and apparently there was no upgrading of seats chosen by pax on payment, the comfortable seats were allowed to go vacant and the pax were compelled to travel in the most uncomfortable seats.
