The premium offering long haul is, I would say, better than most airlines' premium economy but not as good as business class. Yet the price is exceptionally low for what you get. Essentially you pay about a normal airline's economy fare or less for an experience better than premium economy. The food in premium is high quality as are the drinks and the seats are good enough to get a reasonable sleep (although this is not a lie flat bed per business class). The IFE is modern and high quality albeit with a slightly smaller range of movies than a normal airline. Whilst Norwegian are no Ryanair, it is worth remembering that this is a budget airline. You are getting a major discount on long haul with a normal airline but in return you need to follow their rules. If your hand baggage weighs more than 10kg (or 15kg in premium) they will make you pay to check it in. In economy, you don't get a meal unless you pre-order and pay.

I deliberately didn't board until nearer departure so again had no queue at the gate where there is priority boarding for Premium customers. Once on board and after easily finding stowage for my back pack I was offered a glass of water, apple juice or orange juice. A bit dull. A glass of even prosecco would have been well received! I had seat 1A by the window.

The leather covered armchair is wide with about 46"" seat pitch with a lot of recline and an extendable calf supporting foot rest. Whilst a flat bed it is not, it is very comfortable. The IFE comes out on a stalk from one of the arm rests and was easy to use. This even allows you to order drinks or snacks at your seat in between meal services. But I was surprised how poor and dated the choice of movies was. I really struggled to find something I wanted to watch. The inflight service did not start until we had departed about an hour. This was a drinks service and in Premium beer, wine and non-alcoholic beverages are free of charge throughout the flight. But if you want a cocktail you have to pay. I chose red wine though both wine offerings were low end. There are no pretzels, nuts or other snacks offered unless you're prepared to pay for them, which is a bit poor. The main meal was delivered about 30 mins later together with more drinks. As I was in the first row there was 3 choices available. I would say the food quality and quantity was on par with the likes of a BA Premium Economy meal, but it looked cheap as it is served in this flimsy long cardboard box holder with the entree still in foil and metal and very cheap plastic cutlery. The crew were responsive if you requested more beverages throughout the flight, but not particularly warm or friendly. About 90 minutes out of Miami a second meal service was offered. This was a salad with meat and bread rolls offered. Perfectly adequate quality and quantity as not the main meal. Again a full beverage service was offered identical to with the main meal.

Norwegian had scheduled 3 long-haul flights very close to each other, as they don't have online check-in option, and there was only one line, it took more than half an hour to make it to the check-in kiosk. There were 2 attendants milling about to help folks at the kiosks. It was not clear if we could walk to the boarding gate right after getting our boarding passes. It was also not clear if there was a bag drop counter separate from people having other ticketing issues. Norwegian didn't post instructions to direct people whatsoever. Nonetheless, we went to counter to see if it was possible for us to sit together on an 11-hour flight. Instead, we were interrogated by a sour-faced counter attendant. First, she wanted to see my companion's onward flight out of the U.S. My companion showed her the Expedia ticket from her phone. The Norwegian attendant acted like it was a fake ticket. She couldn't locate the flight number from the ticket confirmation! So my companion pulled out her laptop to show the same Expedia confirmation on a bigger screen. The attendant still couldn't locate the flight number. Accusing her that there wasn't any flight number on the Expedia confirmation. Does this person work for an airline? How is it that she can't even find a flight number on ticket confirmation? After wrangling between the info on the phone and the laptop for over 10 mins, I finally located the onward flight number for her. (2) Now about the bags. I had paid for one 20kg checked bag. Turned out it was about 2 kg under the limit. The Norwegian attendant looked over at our backpacks and carry-ons. She proceeded to weigh every bag we were bringing onto the flight. There was no mistake that she was trying to find fault. We ended up being about 4 kg over between the two of us. Amongst this ""excess"" weight were some apples, sandwiches, snack bars, and bottled water. She held on to our passports and tickets and sent us away to figure out how to redistribute all the stuff in our packed bags. We ended up eating some of our apples and drinking our water while putting on extra clothes to lighten the combined weight. Sure thing, that Norwegian attendant played by the book. She didn't do anything wrong. But we were scrutinized like we were criminals. The unpleasant experience continued at CDG airport though it wasn't Norwegian's fault. There were only two officers at passport control to stamp every outgoing non-EU person's passport. By the time I arrived at the non-EU line, it looked like there were people from 6 long-haul flights lined up. At some point, only one immigrant officer was left stamping passports. I was in line for an hour and a half! Having already wasted almost an hour and a half at the Norwegian check-in counter, I made it to the gate only just in time even though we got there more than 3 hours before flight departure.

I found out that I needed a chaperone for the flight due to my son not being old enough to chaperone my daughter. I contacted Norwegian to book a chaperone only to be informed that they do not offer unaccompanied minor service on that flight. Why would their system allow me to book tickets that I could not use? No one on the booking was over 16, and they ask for the ages of the children, so how can it be we were allowed to book tickets that we could not use? This caused us a massive amount of problems, stress and headaches. I contacted Norwegian and was told me that I would have to change the flights and pay $120 each ticket, each way to change them. This was not an option as the booking system should never have allowed us to book flights we could not use. Instead I contacted them again to request that they cancel and credit me for the outgoing flights as my sister in law flew out here and took the kids back to Los Angeles at great expense to her in time and money. She was literally at Heathrow for 3.5 hours. I then had to book a turnaround flight to LAX from Gatwick on Norwegian to pick up the children on the 24th. I had to coordinate my tickets to ensure that I got on the same flight back so I was in Los Angeles for 24 hours. I cannot explain how incredibly difficult this whole production became purely because their system allowed tickets to be booked that could not be used. We spent an incredible amount of time, stress, and money to rectify the failure in their booking system. My sister in law spent thousands of pounds worth of air miles and I spent 448.70 GBP buying a flight that I should not have to have purchased. All I originally requested was for a full refund for the two flights that we were unable to use, which were the two leaving from Gatwick on the 17th.

You call and its says there are 2 hour wait times to reach someone. They stated the next available flight to get home is 2 days from now or they can do a 3 stop transfer totaling 21 hours flight time. Or they said, we can just refund your ticket. We had to pay $2000 per ticket to get home through another airline instead of the $500 ticket we already had through Norwegian.

To know that an airline is okay with cancelling a flight without offering alternative flights for over a day later should be upsetting to most.

About half an hour later, three people were helping the one family at the front, and a supervisor started advising people in the queue that they would either have to sort themselves a hotel and contact Customer Services for a flight home (but that wouldn't be before next Wednesday as no available seats), or find your own way home and claim. By that stage my wife had spent 30mins listening to Norwegian Customer Services apologising for the unusually long call times (and the family at the front of the queue had spent 3hrs talking to Customer Services and the local rep, as they had to get home that night), so my son and I started looking for alternate flights - staying 5 nights in a hotel and losing the income for taking extended unplanned ""vacation"" would have cost more than re-routing via another airline.

"""Seriously delayed""",1,2018-09-13,"New York JFK to Gatwick. Norwegian flight operated by Wamos. Seriously delayed. Poor service. No communication. Lack of food and no entertainment. Scheduled departure was 11:25 am, but actual departure was 10:55pm. An initial delay of 1 hour only became apparent when boarding of the plane should have commenced but didn't. We were told that the reason for the first delay was due to the late arrival of the flight crew. Other than this there was very limited information given to passengers by staff at the airport regarding updates of the new flight schedule. It was gradually set back several times, but each time there was never any communication to passengers at the airport, except when staff were pressured to do so by disgruntled passengers. An update on the airline website advised that meal vouchers would be provided. However, this was another thing that gate staff failed to announce. As a result, a significant number of passengers were not aware of their availability and missed out. During our additional 9 hour wait we were provided with a single meal voucher. There was no consideration given to the fact that we were travelling with a 4-month-old baby and that a meal voucher would not be suitable for her. We did not have sufficient formula feed to cover the added time, but when we queried this with the supervisor at the gate, she said there was nothing she could do about it and suggested we leave the airport to purchase some. We explained that we already had extra in our main suitcase, but she said it would be too difficult to try and locate the case as it was already loaded on to the plane. It was only when we argued that she had a duty of care for passenger welfare that she asked for our luggage to be located and brought to us, which indeed happened. After we eventually boarded the plane at 19:30, our experience continued to be less than satisfactory. Despite travelling with a small child and paying extra for a meal and seat reservation, we were allocated separate seats. It was only after another passenger agreed to swap, that we were able to sit together. We sat at the stand for 2 hours until the plane finally started taxiing. However, it was a further 90 minutes before we actually took off. During this time only a small cup of water was offered on a single occasion. While taxiing, it also became apparent that the crew were unable to properly manage the passengers. Despite being a direct flight between two English speaking countries, the Spanish crew spoke limited English, so struggled to understand a number of simple questions passengers asked them. The lengthy time spent taxiing also caused one passenger to need to use the toilet which one of the crew allowed them to do. This resulted in several other passengers asking to do the same but they were denied by another crew member, causing tensions to rise further. Also whilst the plane was moving several passengers remained standing despite the seatbelt light being illuminated, but at no time did any member of the crew instruct them to sit down. During the flight only water was offered, and there was no mention of food being provided. It was only when someone asked that they were told they could go to the back of the plane and get a sandwich, but they would not be bringing the trolley down the aisle. Once again no announcement was made about the availability of food, and it was only after word spread and more people went to the back of the plane that the crew decided to bring out the trolleys.",True,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York JFK to Gatwick,September 2018,1,1,,1,1,,False,

The day before our return flight I received an SMS that informed me I had been downgraded to economy class. No reason was given, but the options were to accept a 75% refund and take the flight or a full refund to take an alternative flight. At such late notice return flight to the UK would have cost me a minimum of £3,500 so there was no choice.  I called Norwegian Customer Services who offered no apology, explanation for the downgrade or alternatives and eventually hung up on me! There were no Norwegian  representatives at JFK (they hide behind telephone lines and the internet). Complaining to JFK ground staff also proved fruitless although they did give us access to the Lounge and promise us that we would still have the Premium Class meals and drinks. The flight was delayed for over 3 hours. Once we had boarded the plane we spoke to the first Norwegian representative we had seen and complained about our treatment. Again no apology was given although we were told that we had been downgraded because the return aircraft only had 36 Premium seats versus 53 seats in other Boeing 787. No reason was given as to how/why we had been selected for downgrade. Following take-off an FA brought us some blankets as way of recompense for the inconvenience. As meals and drinks were served we were told that we were not entitled to Premium meals/drinks as we would be receiving refunds. Not only was this contrary to what ground staff told us but also to the e-mail I had received from Norwegian informing me of our reassigned economy seats. To claim the refund I have to complete the claim online. I have also been informed by Norwegian customer services that this process can take 6-8 weeks because they have to ""investigate"" the claim and then write me a letter explaining the outcome before payment is made despite me pointing out that they must have all the information on their systems already! They also could not understand why I did not want the refund paid back to my credit card. This was the first time I have been downgraded. I would have expected Norwegian representatives to have bent over backwards to make our flight as comfortable as possible. Instead it seemed as if they wanted to rub salt into the wounds at every possible opportunity. I  will never fly this airline again.

"""legroom very limited""",7,2018-07-18,"I go to Norway every two years to see family and friends, so I was delighted to learn about the international service a couple of years ago. I flew Norwegian 2 July, and return OSL-JFK on 13 July this year, my second trip with them. While there's still an element of cool and style about this brand, the passenger experience aligns more with the values and customer service of a low-cost airline. First, the seats. They look worn, and they're very close together. Pitch is minimal, so legroom very limited. Once the seat in front of you reclines (only about 4 or 5 cm) it's nearly impossible to use the tray table. I noted that on my flight ex JFK that my seatbelt was very dirty. I paid more to sit in the second-last row, in 35A. Even then, the design of the seats in front meant that it was very uncomfortable to take advantage of the extra legroom.  The staff is present during service sectors of the flight, and they are polite and know their jobs very well. What surprised me this trip was that the crew seemed entirely American, with the exception of the flight deck. Also, there were no announcements in the Norwegian language. That was surprising. The food is typical economy fare (though you pay extra for it). The meal I had on the way back wasn't at all terrible in terms of quality, but it's presented in a paper box/puzzle thing, that gets warm and falls apart almost immediately. A tray for the meal wouldn't hurt, and it's sustainable. My verdict is that ticket prices certainly don't make this a low-cost experience, or even a charter airline experience. On many charter companies all pax get a meal, for example. A round-trip, which I bought too late as I had to sort out commitments, was $1400US. I bought it in May, for a July trip. That's not cheap, so while I can say that I had a beautiful time in Oslo and Sunnmøre I'll perhaps switch to a European legacy carrier for trips home in future. Book, this airline, though, if you're looking for a direct way to get to Oslo from the east coast of the United States. Try to choose a good seat, and eat and rest before you fly.

We paid extra for this particular flight only to learn it was cancelled 10 days prior to departure for an inspection. After 2+ hours on hold we were given a flight from Boston to Newark on United and then to Paris Orly on Norwegian. This flight totaled approximately 13 hours including layover but it was the only option they had for us arriving the same day. We arrived in Newark and waited in an hour and a half security line with two young kids at 11:00pm. We arrived at the terminal where were informed the flight was delayed for technical issues. Shortly after the announcement the gate staff disbanded and it was over 40 minutes later they abruptly announced the flight was cancelled and directed us to the baggage area. By now it was past 1am. Interestingly enough all of the gate staff that had left were down at the ticket counter so clearly they knew the flight was going to be cancelled up to an hour before letting their customers know. We retrieved our baggage and then had to wait in a line with hundreds of people for hotel vouchers. We arrived at the hotel at 3am and were told the flight was delayed until 7am. At 7am the flight was delayed until noon. At noon the flight was delayed until 1pm. During this time I waited on hold for Norwegian customer service for cumulatively for 5 hours.

At 12:20pm the rebooking hotline picked up and promptly told me there was nothing she could do, as the flight was still ‘delayed’, and was going to put me back through to customer service. When asked how that would help she said “I don’t know”. I asked if she could help me come up with an alternative flight arrangement in the event the flight was cancelled and she said “no”.

They charge not only for luggage but also for water, yes water, on a over 8 hour long trip they didn't have the courtesy to provide the customers with water. They also charge for blankets, food, snacks, everything. The sits in the airplane are very uncomfortable and they don't recline not even 1/2 inch. They crank up the AC in the airplane so if you don't have a sweatshirt you'd have to buy their blankets, otherwise you'd freeze. On our way back from Italy, we left from Malpensa airport. Our flight was supposed to leave at 13:50 on June 8th. The first bad sign about this whole experience with Norwegian was that there was not any Norwegian presence at the airport. We arrived the night before the flight at the airport and looked around and saw absolutely no Norwegian presence anywhere, not a sign or desk. I had to check by travel documents to make sure I was at the right airport. There was an airport strike and 99% of the flights were cancelled. But, of course our flight wasn't, in fact the flight left 2 hours earlier and my wife and I and quite a few other passengers weren't informed. No announcements, no emails, no texts. I called their customer service in the US and got a busy signal. I then called the Denmark customer service and because I was calling from Italy from my US phone, the signal was terrible and they couldn't understand me, at least that's what they told me, but I heard them loud and clear, they didn't want to bother with my problem. I called them a second time and the customer service heard me, but after a few seconds put me on hold and hung up. I called the US customer service and finally got a hold of someone, who did not care or helped me. She said I had to find someone in the airport to help me. After a while my nice manner with this customer service representative worn off and I gave her a piece of my mind about Norwegian airlines. Needless to say I got ripped off by an airline company that only care about taking advantage of customers with bait and switch tactics, terrible service, terrible customer service. In my mind for some reason I thought that European service/customer service would be a lot better then any other part of the world, but right now, its the worse possible. Norwegian did not refund my flight and I had to book a flight back from Malpensa to NYC and the only airline available that would fly that day was Emirates and for last minute booking for $1,200.00 for two people direct flight was fantastic.

As well as the cabin I wanted the flexibility of changing my tickets last minute as I am fortunate to be able to travel on a whim. The outbound flight on the 787 was satisfactory and met my expectation although the cabin crew whilst fulfilled their duty were the most miserable crew I have ever flown with.

Apparently Norwegian never flies the Dreamliner on Sundays and Tuesday even though their website states they do. I’m not sure if factual but the chap said that they only operate 7 Dreamliner’s.

However that was not the case - the funny part is that when we were boarding there was advertisement in the few screens that were available on top of some seats about the in flight entertainment, WiFi, cool movies with sound etc. However, the aircraft did not provide anything related to that so I was disappointed.

Overall the experience was OK, some of the positives being that the Boeing Dreamliner is great. Seats are comfortable, the entertainment system is contemporary. We got a good price also and the food on menu was not bad. However there were a couple of things which bothered us: 1) One of the flight attendants was rude. Most of the crew was British and there were some good attendants on the flight but unfortunately for us, the man serving us was rude to us on more than one occasion. He would ask us to tell him our names before handing over the food we had paid for like we were prisoners. To others he would patiently explain the menu, to us he would come and shout ""Chicken or fish"". Once my wife changed her mind and asked to change her initial meal choice from chicken to fish, to which he very rudely exclaimed - ""Oh you want fish now !"". 6 hours into the flight, he woke us to give the snack. I was a bit sleepy and asked him if we could have it later, he snapped back and said ""No, you can have it now or not have it at all"". 2) There were no headphones on the flight. First of all, we were not aware that we had to buy headphones. I can understand the airline is trying to save cost and pass on that benefit to the consumer, but it would be good if they can add a note in the booking that passengers need to arrange their headphones or buy in-flight. Anyways, it was only 3$ so we asked to buy when we were told there were no headphones on the flight. Upon asking why, the staff told us they ""forgot to load up"". On a 13 hour flight, that can be a bit annoying. We spent the 13 hours without headphones.

I usually fly short-haul around 10 times a year with Norwegian, back and forth between the UK and Scandinavia for the most part, and have always had positive experiences. The flights are basic, but it isn't expensive to add on extras such as baggage/seat allocation (much cheaper than the other budget airlines out there!) - these additions can also be made up to 24 hours before flight time, so if you realise a day before that you want an extra bag you don't have to pay any more than if you decide this at the time of booking. Their rewards system is also great, and you can get free seat allocation, fast track and baggage allowances the more often you fly with them. Although you don't get anything on the flight, when you are flying short haul this really isn't an issue - you can buy a bottle of water at the airport (or, if you are in Scandinavia, you can fill up your own bottle for free from drinking fountains in the airports!) and take a snack with you if you so wish, but their flights are usually only 2-4 hours around Europe so you don't need anything else. I often download a film or a couple of episodes of a TV series onto my iPad and watch these on the flight, or just read a book - so not having in-flight entertainment doesn't bother me. They also have WiFi on a lot of flights, which tends to be intermittent at times. My only gripe is that their flights can sometimes be delayed by up to an hour (I've never experienced a longer delay in 40+ flights with them, although I do know people who have been unlucky enough to). The delays can be frustrating, but they tend to make up time in the air. Also, they are on average half the price of their competitors so I am happy to spend an extra 45 mins reading a book at the airport to get a cheaper flight.",False,Boeing 737,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Stockholm,June 2017,5,4,,4,5,,True,3

While the plane itself was a beautiful new Boeing 787-dreamliner with the latest in tech, the cabin was woefully understaffed.

Only once in an 11 hour nightmare, after begging a flight attendant, was I given water on the plane. Apparently, they require that you purchase a $5 bottle of water, not only is this environmentally irresponsible, but grossly negligent to those customers who may not want to pay for extras.

I had a 9 hour over-night flight with Norwegian and was very disappointed with their service. The plane was incredibly cold and we were not provided with blankets or pillows, and when I asked for anything that could keep me warm as I was shivering they said the only option was to buy a blanket for $7. As my flight was part of a 3-part journey (I travelled from Managua to Fort Lauderdale with another airline, then Fort Lauderdale to Copenhagen and Copenhagen to Gatwick with Norwegian Air), I was not given the option to choose food online, nor was I told that we needed to select which meal we wanted. Everyone around my friend and I were served food, and when we asked the air hostess why we were not given any she told us it was because we had opted out of having food, so they could not serve us anything - not even a drink, even though all food and drink was free and included in the flight ticket. The next morning, the same thing happened, and I had an argument with the same air hostess who would not even give us a cup of coffee even though there was plenty to spare. We had been travelling for 35 hours and had no food or drinks, but she insisted she couldn't give us a cup of coffee otherwise ""everyone on the flight could have one"". Yes, everyone on the flight should get a cup of coffee if they want one. The airline even has a video explaining how they believe that if their customers ""don't want something, they don't have to pay for it."" - examples included checked-in luggage and coffee on the flight. Yes, Norwegian Air, if I don't have luggage to check-in and don't want an extra coffee, then like every airline in the world, I shouldn't have to pay for it, but starving your passengers because your online food booking system didn't work, especially when the food is free anyway, does not count as a customer not wanting something and not having to pay for it.

"""recommend Norwegian readily""",8,2017-05-18,"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Los Angeles. As a family travelling with a nearly two year old daughter, this was the first time we had flown long haul. Norwegian were significantly cheaper than the next best flight deal and a fraction of the cost of noted major airlines. We wondered where was the catch? We flew London Gatwick to Los Angeles and then returned Oakland to Gatwick two weeks later, after driving up the Californian coast to see family. Norwegian were clean, efficient and on the whole very good. Yes it's a budget airline and there were no free blankets or monogrammed earphones but we didn't need that, who does? It's not like flying Business on a big name airline but it is a fraction of the price, so what are you expecting? Norwegian were comparable, cheaper and perhaps even better than most other airlines I have flown with in economy class. Even the Premium seats looked good and seemed pretty good value compared to business on other airlines. It was a new aircraft (Boeing 787), in a clean condition with a pretty good entertainment system that contained a fairly large section of movies, games and TV programmes. As a parent the cabin crew were mostly polite to us and our daughter. Luckily we secured a bank of three seats (there and back) and our daughter slept for most of the journey (worth planning the times of flights to coincide with sleep times as that helps). As an under two you don't have to pay for a seat for them, but that does mean they are supposed to stay on your knee the whole journey (and no food is provided for them). Had we not had the extra seat that would have been tricky, but that is not an issue with Norwegian but travelling with a toddler! I would say that if you are travelling with an active under two, that it might be worth paying the money for an extra seat, as long haul with a nearly two year old child on your lap might be a terrible experience or chance it like we did and hope to get lucky with a spare seat. The catch? None that we could see and we would recommend Norwegian readily.

Not satisfied with this, the return flight was worse. In New York I hurt my ankle and could not walk, again on checking in (please note I was in a wheelchair, also holding my crutches) I asked to be seated in the exit seats or a seat with room to rest my leg.

Not that it mattered as my headphone socket was broken. I'd paid extra for the food upgrade (£50 each way). The food was as basic as you get. I've seen better school dinners than this food.

I fly to New York once a year usually from my regional airport connecting via Heathrow to New York, I was thinking of ways to cut costs and make my annual transatlantic flight a lot cheaper for me. I had done some research with the help of google and sky scanner and everything kept pointing to Norwegian. I never had heard of them before and I was wary of travelling with them, so I extended my research on the airline. I looked on their website and it looked very promising. New dreamliners, great routes, excellent prices. It seemed too good to be true but anyway, after some thought I purchased my ticket and waited till the day. I drove down to Gatwick and walked into South Terminal where I checked in at the Kiosk, very fast and simple, the kiosk printed out my bag tag, I labelled my luggage and went to the bag drop where there was no queue at all, I simply passed over my bag to the Aviator staff and they sent it down the belt. So now I'm checked in, I have dropped off my luggage and my flight is on time. No problem so far, time to proceed through security. Getting slightly anxious about trying out this airline for the first time I proceeded to my gate. Once again no queue at the gate, very simple I got my pass scanned and I sat in the gate and waited for my flight to be called for boarding. The only bad experience I had was the International Passenger Survey guys hounding me asking questions about my reasons for travel in the gate. Before I knew it, Norwegian Flight DY7015 was ready for boarding, they invited forward the premium passengers first then economy class straight after. I boarded the flight and found my seat. The aircraft was brand new, clean and comfortable. There was relaxing music playing as boarding commenced and the cabin crew looked very smart and so polite. I sat down and waited for doors closed. They then played us a video about the benefits and advantages of flying on the Dreamliner followed by Norwegian's inflight safety demo. The flight to JFK was smooth. I'd like to point out that the IFE was among the best IFE system I've used. Movies, games, music, information about Norwegian and the map was greatly detailed. They also have a built in snack bar so you can scroll through drinks and snacks and then just swipe your card under the screen and within minutes the crew are by your side with your snacks. The snack bar isn't the cheapest and some items are rather overpriced but its not a big problem. This is low cost done very well. I had the most pleasant experience flying with Norwegian and I now prefer this airline over British Airways who I usually fly with.

I guess they were able to check in online and bypass the nasty ground staff. For some reason, Norwegian wouldn't let us check in online, maybe because we have a connection to a US flight. The thing that was also troubling is that Norwegian uses the same ground services company for luggage, as the one that lost our suitcase several days prior. I have never had such a problem on other European airlines, nor on US airlines. Lastly, we are connecting onto a flight to The US and booked the Premium cabin (Norwegian's discount business). However they still nickel and dimed us on the connecting flight, charging for water.

The flight was originally scheduled to leave at 2230 (Jan 8th) with everyone for the flight was already at the airport by the time the delays began meaning that we spent approx. 10 hours in the airport overnight with the flight eventually taking off after 6 am (Jan 9th). It was nice of the airline to offer everyone a $15 meal voucher to be used in the airport for our 9+ hour delay, but what they chose not to share as they were handing these out was that there was not a single restaurant or snack bar open in JFK terminal 1 at that time making these vouchers useless. There was no communication from the ground staff of the airline at all and around 1230 am the single Norwegian agent left the gate desk and did not reappear until boarding was scheduled to begin, effectively escaping any accountability or communication to the 300+ stranded passengers. In fact, around 2am the flight listing itself was removed from both the airport departure screens and the Norwegian flight status tracker on their website, leaving the 300+ passengers searching for any agent to provide information as to whether the flight had been cancelled. From the Norwegian website I could see that our incoming flight from Oslo was scheduled to depart Oslo at 6pm local time (noon in New York) and was itself delayed by 8 hours. It became abundantly clear that Norwegian failed to alert passengers on our flight of this delay and chose to inform us of the delay in 1-2 hour increments once we were all already at the airport in order to avoid any associated financial liability to provide passengers for hotel accommodations, meals, rebooking, etc due to the delay. Given I had family I could stay with in the NYC area, upon learning of the first 2 hour delay I called the airline's customer service line to be moved to the flight the next day instead and avoid any prolonged stay in the airport. I was told by the agent that, although the delay allowed me to rebook on another Norwegian flight free of charge, the airline ""was not permitting"" passengers from our delayed flight to rebook onto another flight until 2 days later. When I inquired if this was because the flights over the next two days were full or because we weren't allowed to be moved to the next day's flight the agent, confusingly, was unable to confirm one way or the other. Additionally, once we were finally on the flight the plane itself was a disaster and had not been cleaned.

"""I cannot yet recommend""",4,2016-12-04,"✅ Verified Review | Fort Lauderdale to Paris CDG. There is so much potential for Norwegian here in the States as an economical choice for overseas travel, but a few big dings against it make me not want to fly again. First, let me say the on-board experience is great. The staff is very attentive and the fleet is all new and clean. I found the economy seats to be comfortable and just enough leg room for a 6'-2"" guy. The inflight entertainment is acceptable, and ordering food and drinks from the snack bar is quick and easy. For the price, it does not feel much different than any other major airline. No complaints here. The Norwegian App is easy to use, and I thought it would be a big time-saver for check-in. However - and they do not say this online - all flights to/from the USA require in-person check-in. This was an issue, especially for someone like me who was flying in from another city. After landing in Fort Lauderdale, I had to exit completely out of the airport terminal, walk to another terminal, and then wait in line to check-in to my flight to Paris. Spending 2 hours in line with about 300 other people on my flight, I realized this is Norwegian's biggest hurdle to overcome. It's very clear that the Fort Lauderdale airport (which is currently expanding) is not yet equipped to handle the volume of air traffic going through it. I would recommend realistically planning for around 3-4 hours between flights if you are considering flying in from out of town. Getting through border patrol and out of the airport on the way back was just as chaotic. My return flight was delayed by 1.5 hours, which made me miss my connecting flight home and necessitated a hotel stay in Fort Lauderdale. This apparently is a common occurrence on Norwegian, and the second big ding against it. Between the delayed flight, the time waiting in lines, and the hotel stay, I ended up spending about as much money (and a great deal more time) than if I had booked direct out of my city.

"""the seat has plenty of legroom""",6,2016-12-01,"✅ Verified Review |  
London Gatwick to Ford Lauderdale. Having flown domestically to FLL I jumped at the opportunity to fly direct to FLL from the UK. At LGW a premium cabin ticket gives you access to the One Lounge giving a haven away from the main waiting area. There are plenty of drinks and snacks - the food items available to order are limited and perhaps a bit heavy but having lounge access included is a definite plus. I arrived at the gate and there were 3 lines processing passengers. There was no dedicated line for premium cabin holders advertised and I was in no particular hurry to board so I did not test is priority was available by pushing my way to the front of line. I did observe one person being ejected from the flight for failure to supply satisfactory onward travel arrangements before boarding - they are very hot on this so if you are travelling ESTA ensure you can explain to Norwegian what your onward travel plans are if you are not a return ticket! On board I was offered some water before departure. The seat has plenty of legroom (6ft 4in) and the width is good. It is a recline seat but unless you are small you will have difficulty getting into a natural sleeping position. It is vastly superior to other airlines Premium Economy offerings. Better than Premium Economy but not lie flat business. Food is a standard economy single tray meal augmented with bread on the side. In the premium cabin the main meal and a snack before landing with soft drinks decanted from large bottles / cartons (and also some wine from what I saw) are included with your ticket whereas cans and items such as nuts or anything else off the on-demand menu would need to be purchased like in the main cabin. Conceptually the premium product is excellent. However, arriving into FLL internationally is a poor experience and Norwegian have to accept some of the responsibility as it is a core element of their product. The flight was due to arrive at 20.00. We arrived early at 19.00. We went directly to a stand but there was no air bridge available. The airport claimed due to a number of flights arriving at the same time they could have us disembark and so we were left waiting for the handling agents to service the aircraft. 20.00, our scheduled arrival, came round and still we were left on the plane, doors locked. It became clear that the 344 seat 787 was going have to wait for buses and stairs. Finally at 20.30 a full hour and a half after landing facilities were provided. On opening the doors the ground handling agent ""jokingly"" told the cabin crew to inform the flight crew that they should ""not fly so fast"" seemingly insensitive to the fact that so many long haul passengers had been locked on the aircraft for an hour and a half after an 8.5 hour flight. How can Norwegian find this service from their handling agent acceptable? Immigration/Customs at FLL is chaotic. There is no dedicated line for US passport holders or permanent residents so everyone is lumped together. Unless you have Global Entry be prepared. After landing at 7pm I was finally able to leave the airport terminal at 2330. If you fly Norwegian into FLL you need to prepare yourself for the fact the FLL is not really ready to handle such large international aircraft gracefully if there is just the slightest change in capacity. Unfortunately this torrid experience undermines the great price for the ticket (£1000 return).

Norwegian are very open on their website as to what each fares offer and what you get with your ticket and what you don't, so we knew what service to expect. We chose the low fare+ ticket as we had cases to check in and wanted the meal option. On to the flight Norwegian operate a very modern fleet of Boeing 787's for long haul flights, I've never flown on one of these before and was impressed with the comfort levels in the cabin along with all the little extra touches (sub charger points, sunglasses mode on Windows, mood lighting etc). The IFE screens are very good also (the best I've come across so far for clarity) and offer plenty of choice. The moving map was also pretty cool. The inflight service on both outbound and return flight was very good, crew was very polite and helpful. The meals were very good and pretty tasty. Both flights took of on time and landed early. It's a shame Norwegian don't offer this service all year round as I would use them for this route all the time. They only operate between November and April to work with the cruises which is understandable but annoying as it would be great to have a non stop option year long rather than have to use another airline with at least 1 layover. The only small negatives I would mention would be the boarding process being a bit chaotic and unorganised. once they had board indeed rows 25-47 the announcements seemed to stop and everyone just bundled on.

"""strongly hesitate in travelling with them again""",3,2016-11-04,"✅ Verified Review | Oslo to Dublin with Norwegian. I would have to countenance this airline's ""low-fares"" branding.

"""toward the top end of the spectrum""",7,2016-10-11,"✅ Verified Review |  Recently took Norwegian for a trip to Europe. We went New York to Paris roundtrip. As far as budget airlines go, I would put this toward the top end of the spectrum. The planes are new and nice, IFE systems are top-notch, and service is pretty good as well. That said, keep in mind that even though things look sleek and well put together, you are still flying a budget airline and everything cost something. Of course, that is a given, but I was a little surprised when they didn't even offer water on a 7hr transatlantic flight. Also, they really push their duty free sales prior to landing - even going as far as turning on the cabin lights an hour and a half before landing, so you can see what they are selling. All that said, I do think the cheap ticket prices and new planes make it worth the flight - just know what you are getting into. Here are some helpful tips that I learned from my flight: Norwegian is very strict about the weight of carry-on bags, going as far as weighing every bag you are carrying (including purses and backpacks). Make sure your bags are no more then 10KG or they will make you check it. Buy food for the flight before getting to the airport and bring it onto the plane. That said, don't bring anything that will require hot water or rehydration (eg - Ramen/Cup of Noodles), as they will not give you the hot water, you'll have to buy it. If you do want to buy food onboard, do not reserve a meal before the flight, it's $45. Instead, buy the meal or snacks from the IFE system, it will only cost $14. Note that they might run out though.  Boarding in NYC was quick and efficient, however boarding in Paris was a mess with staff losing control of the process creating a free-for-all to get on the plane. If you are picking a seat, do not pick the bulkheads. We sat in row 7 on the JFK-CDG flight, and even though we had extra leg room, the seats were extremely narrow and a bit hard.

I also took an empty litre bottle through security and filled it up airside. No pillows supplied but had my own neck pillow.

I checked in no problem at Gatwick, the flight left on time and arrived at JFK 45 minutes early.

Be warned that cash is not accepted so travel with a credit card if you will order more than your 1 drink and meal. The Boeing 787 is a nice plane, much larger seats and the dimming windows are good. Norwegian seem to have an issue with the 11pm flight out of JFK to Gatwick. One of my family members was travelling on this flight on Tuesday 8th Sept and she received an email to say it had been cancelled due to technical issues. They did offer to move her onto the next day’s flight at no additional cost or to put her on a flight back with HiFly. 4 days later and it was my turn, I received the same email to say that my 11pm flight from JFK had been cancelled due to technical faults and offered the same options. When I asked if I could be moved onto the next day’s flight I was told that it wasn’t possible and they could offer me a flight 4 days later! Due to work commitments  that wasn’t possible so I had to cancel my return leg and book with Virgin to get me home by the scheduled time.

"""I really liked inflight entertainment""",8,2015-09-10,"We chose Norwegian initially because it turned out to be the cheapest transatlantic and within Europe flight, and we flew Norwegian 4 times in 2 weeks (NY-Stockholm; Stockholm-Munich; Prague-Copenhagen; Copenhagen-NY). 3 of the 4 flights were timely and we arrived to the destination even earlier than planned. One flight (Copenhagen to NY) was delayed by about 3 hours, but landed only 1 hour late in JFK airport. We flew the Boeing 787 twice, both transatlantic flights. It's a very nice and efficient aircraft. The seats are about average width and so is the leg room. I found the seats a little more comfortable than on other airlines, but the difference is not significant. The service was standard. If there is one minor complaint I have about the staff, it is that when I was waiting for the delayed flight out of Copenhagen to NY, I was pretty sick with a fever and the flight attendants who were sitting near me were pretty loud and I couldn't relax and rest. Everyone else in the waiting area were quiet and the only loud noise was coming from them. I thought they should have been a little more courteous to their passengers. Otherwise, they were good during the flight. The one thing I really liked was the in-flight entertainment. It had all the recent top movies, some games, a lot of different types of music and more. Of course, this is a relatively new airline and aircraft, so this is expected. The one thing I didn't like about Norwegian was that you have to pay $50 extra for seat selection and checked in luggage. I think this is deceptive marketing, because they initially attract you with their low price, and then you find out that you have to pay $50 more (unless you are not checking in luggage and don't care about seat selection, in which case it's a good option). But even after another $50, it's still cheaper than the competition. Hence, it's not a big negative on the airline.

We eventually arrived at Gatwick 32 hours and 10 minutes after we should have. Norwegian then took over 4 weeks to provide a certificate of delay. They have now rejected the claim for passenger compensation on the grounds of ""exceptional circumstances"" ie the thunderstorm. The cabin crew were fine if a little embarassed and the captain apologised profusely for the service we received. A good number of the party we were in were aged 70s and 80s.

The queue was huge and everyone was fed up of having to be there so early and wait for so long. No apologies from staff. By the time we got through security it was now 6.15am. We ran to passport control, to get at the gate and find another queue. Staff seemed to know that the flight was delayed and not informed the customers.

Having had a good experience using them on the seasonal flight from Edinburgh to Stockholm, I decided to use them again for this trip to Berlin now they have a significant base at London Gatwick, my preferred London airport. There were a few downsides - I have so far mainly flown out of the North Terminal which is a far superior facility with much better environment so the dingy South Terminal wasn't the most pleasurable place to spend time in - I would dread having a delay here. Outbound flight was delayed and the line was slow even to get into the waiting area as they only had one person to check everyones boarding passes despite a full flight. The app while useful is a bit slow and buggy and the QR code is too small for a lot of Airport scanners. These small niggles aside, once onboard it was clear why I had chosen to fly Norwegian again, clean new planes with a reserved seat at a fantastic price. The crew were also very noticeably very warm and friendly - unlike previously where they were efficient and but a bit brusque and cold. The free WiFi that actually works in the air is also a really nice touch.

The experience was spoiled by the insane procedure Norwegian have for serving food an beverages. You have to book a meal 48hrs before the flight. If you do not (I only bought my flight 36 hours ahead) or you do not want their bad and very expensive food, then you are in for a nasty surprise. They cater for all advance food orders first. Anyone who does not have an advance order cannot get more than a glass of water for 2 hours into the flight. They go up and down the aisle, dispensing food and wine and soft drinks, but refuse to serve you if you did not book an advance meal. It is ridiculous and makes one feel like some sort of third class passenger. I paid the same price for my ticket, but am penalized because I didn't opt to buy one of their poor meals.

Norwegian customer review,1,2015-08-05,"The first sign of trouble was a text message I received the morning of the flight that told me there would be a 5 hour delay to my flight. Instead of leaving at 18.30 it was scheduled to leave a 23.40. Even though there was a 5 hour delay I was told that I had to check in by 17.30. This left me with hours of waiting in the airport, at 22.30 when the flight was supposed to board nothing came up on the screens. I had heard that we were boarding from gate 15 so I headed that way only to be told by a fellow passenger that we had been asked to go to the information desk. Once there we were told by a representative that Gatwick had strict noise reduction policies that meant the flight was not allowed to land. Flight was postponed until the next day, they did not provide hotels for anyone and instead left all passengers to fend for themselves. I used my 90 minutes of free wifi to find myself a place - this was difficult as most places were booked up and by this point it was past midnight. We also had to recollect our checked in luggage and as there were no staff around to guide us this was chaos. The next day I returned and tried to check in using the computers as there was an hour long line to check in with staff. I was told that I could not check in using the computers as I had already checked in so I joined the line - at no point did I see any representatives of the airline, nobody knew what to do or where to go. Once I checked in I was given a £10 food voucher, from talking to the other passengers I found out that it should have been £20 so after going through security I had to go to the information desk to get the remaining £10 voucher. The flight was supposed to board at 17.55. The time came and went and nothing came up on the screen. Eventually we got a departure gate. We didn't board until past 20.00. Onboard at my seat the reading light didn't work, the television didn't work and when I brought this to the attention of the crew members they just shrugged.

Norwegian customer review,1,2015-07-31,"Stockholm Arlanda - LAX, flight DY7087, 30 July 2015: Our flight home to LAX, was chartered out to EuroAtlantic Airways. We were supposed to fly home on a Boeing 787, but instead were flown on a very old Boeing 777. This was by far my worst experience with a long-haul flight, and I travel internationally about once every 1-2 years. I will not fly Norwegian for a long-haul flight again in the future. I guess you get what you pay for. Problems during pre-flight check-in process: My seat was reassigned from 13D to 53A. I had paid extra in order to choose my seat when I booked, and so this reassignment to the back of the plane was not something I was happy about. At least my husband and I were reassigned to seats next to each other, which was not the case for some passengers. The pre-boarding process was chaos. All passengers were required to stay in a small holding area for more than 1.5 hours while waiting for announcements from staff. Boarding took about 45 minutes to begin. There was then no further boarding announcements, just a sudden chaotic surge of people toward the gate. No order of boarding by rows or early boarding was done. So the boarding process itself took at least another hour. By this time our flight takeoff was delayed 2.5 hours. Features of this aircraft which were very disappointing: Aircraft was dirty and smelt. Dust and food particles on seats, trash stuck in various places, including in the ashtrays in the armrests. The entertainment system was basically non-functional. After messing around with it we discovered it had about 4 analog stations showing 3 TV comedy programs in a continuous loop. Often there was so much static they were impossible to watch. The audio outlets appeared to be for the old 3-prong type earphones from the 1980s. Using my own headset only allowed sound in one ear. The gluten free menu I had ordered was delivered promptly. The flight attendants would not collect my trash for about 2.5 hours after it was served, even when I requested it to be collected. No climate control (air vents) for passengers. It was all centrally controlled, so either was too hot or too cold the whole flight. With my window seat, the window shades (closed) were very hot as we flew over Greenland and Canada. This made the flight even more uncomfortable. Very limited beverage choices, and provided infrequently. We had to go to the galley at the rear of the plane twice to request water. Positives about this flight: The seats had footrests, which helped a bit with my lower back pain.

Trouble is, you have to personally walk your luggage through customs, then check it in again - once boarding starts, the baggage drop does not accept bags anymore.

Norwegian customer review,1,2015-06-14,"We were scheduled to go to JFK in NYC on Thursday, June 11, 2015 at 6.15 pm. The flight was cancelled. We were informed that we could wait until Saturday, June 13th or wait for a plane from Euro-Atlantic to arrive with a new departure time of 3 am. It took over 2 hours to receive food vouchers and new boarding passes. As we left the gate, we noticed that the new boarding passes were issued to 2 people, not us, and for a different flight. We then tried to return to #50 departure gate to inform the agent of the error but were stopped by security. We repeatedly asked security for help but were redirected through various procedures from staff before being allowed to go back to the Norwegian desk in the terminal (not at the gate where they were first issued) to get new boarding passes. After we received the new boarding passes, we returned to the restaurant area only to learn that the food vendors had closed. We then tried to sleep in the airport at restaurant booths or chairs, anything that appeared comfortable. At 2 am we returned to gate 50, as previously directed, to find no personnel from Norwegian. There was a security guard there who would not allow us to sit in ""a secured area"". We were not allowed to check in or board until after 3 am and we did not depart until 4 am, 10 hours after our original scheduled time. The original flight that was cancelled was the cause of this confusion and inconvenience. The misinformation from Norwegian staff was also confusing and upsetting. None of the employees seemed to know procedure and provided conflicting information. Yes, flights are cancelled all the time but paying customers should not be treated this way. We were shuffled around with absolutely no regard for us. It was exhausting. The airline could have opened their lounge, provided fresh food and a more comfortable place to rest since we had to wait an extended time. It was deplorable how we were treated.

I knew about being charged for everything before I started this trip so I took food and water with me both flights. I saw what they fed for the outlandish price and glad I did not buy their food. This return trip was on 4/6/2015 from Oslo to Orlando. I figured it would be late. It was. But first the Gate people came into the room and told everybody had to get out of the gate room. Then a Norwegian Police woman searched the room looking under everything and all over. Then they kept us waiting out in the hallway for a long time. Then they started letting people back in and looking only at their boarding passes and passports. They did not search any luggage so what was the police search of the room for? I think it was just a delay because the plane was not ready to fly. Finally we boarded and left about 1 hour late. Then as others had predicted, the plane became very cold after they finished dinner. I noticed everybody putting on jackets and had to put mine on. I complained and was greeted by a rude stewardess. I then went to the head Stewardess and she did turn the heat up. My home airport is Tampa. Yes, I saved a few hundred crossing to Oslo, but after I made connections to where I was going, I saved nothing and flew on a inferior airline. Their planes do not have a balanced heating system, they charge for everything, and some of the flight crew are rude. As noted in some reviews, customer service is poor.

assignment unless you pay another 33 Euros for each service for each leg of the trip.

Norwegian customer review,8,2015-06-11,"DY2514, LGW-CPH / DY7011, CPH-JFK. Arrived last night from London via CPH on Norwegian and the experience was again positive save two points. Both flights were slightly delayed by 10-15mins but arrived on time. Online check in via the Norwegian app from LGW was great, the self tagging and bag drop all worked a treat. Boarding organized and surprisingly fast. 737-800 looked new and clean. The free onboard wifi was fast and greatly appreciated. Seat comfort and legroom was fine considering the length of the flight. Service at counter and onboard seemed friendly enough. Point one -It was unfortunate that there is no through-check in with Norwegian which meant, upon arrival at CPH, going through immigration, getting bags, clearing customs and checking in again and doing that whole security rigmarole for the JFK flight. The boarding on that flight was orderly though very slow as it was a full flight. Once airborne, the crew were friendly and pleasant. Both meals ordered were served and decent.  Point two - While the much touted IFE system is great the selection of movies and TV shows available was very limited and dated. Seat comfort and legroom is reasonable. Takeaway - For the price Norwegian beats out a lot of 'full service' airlines. It doesn't feel as 'cheap' as other LCCs.

Norwegian customer review,2,2015-05-20,Travelling from Edinburgh to Rome with a connection at Copenhagen. The first section of the flight was very stressful due to the check-in at Edinburgh. I only had hand luggage but had to queue up along with everyone who had baggage to drop off. There was a large group of men travelling with rifles and ammunition which took up a lot of time with only two desks open but no special provision made. Edinburgh service personnel said that Norwegian Air had only paid for two desks and there was nothing to be done. Eventually someone was found to open another desk which sped it up a bit. I was in the queue for over an hour with many still behind me. The plane was delayed 30 mins due to this disorganised system. Apart from the hassle of having to wait in this long queue unnecessarily it was very stressful as the time in between my flights was only one hour so it was a worry for the first leg of the journey. I returned from Rome with Ryanair today arrival time happening to be at the same time as the check- in for the same flight to Copenhagen with Norwegian Air and saw exactly the same problem as Friday with long queue with mix same customers with hand luggage and those with full trolleys of baggage. There are self service machines for a number of air companies but not Norwegian Air in Edinburgh. Again the ground service staff said that Norwegian Air had not paid for that facility. Once we were on board the captain apologised for the delay saying that it was due to the inexperience of the system the new ground staff!. I have enjoyed flights with Norwegian Air from Scandinavia to Britain and Europe over the last 3 years. Had been impressed with the airline and deliberately chose them to go to Rome as an alternative to trying to go via London. However after this experience which was like stepping back many years pre Internet booking I will avoid it until they sort out these difficulties. If Norwegain Air aren't prepared to invest in the same systems in the UK its cheapness will not compensate for the difficulty hassle and stress of checking in.

Firstly economy was absolutely fine for the price but beware that you will get charged for everything including headphones and blankets as with another budget airline but the great thing is that you order everything that you would want via the touch screen TV in the back of the chair in front so there is waiting around for the cabin crew to go up and down the aisle to serve you. The selection was OK and the service was excellent and fast but no cash at all is accepted only credit cards . You can pre order proper meals when you buy your ticket which we had done and the food was great you can of course bring on your own food.

Norwegian customer review,10,2015-04-19,I flew from Gatwick to Berlin on 5th April (DY2498) and returned on the 9th April (DY2499). The flights were very cheap and £29.99 outbound and £27.99 inbound. I was only carrying hand luggage. This was my second time flying with Norwegian but the first time flying with them short haul. I had flown on their 787 Dreamliner from Gatwick to New York and return last August of which you can find my review for on this Norwegian review page. My parents have flown Norwegian short haul from Gatwick before and were very impressed so I was looking forward to comparing their long haul service with their short haul service. Boarded on time on the outbound journey unfortunately the aircraft was not one of the new Sky interior fitted ones but was clean and comfortable. Departed a little late due to heavy traffic at Gatwick as it is a single runway airport. I was very impressed with the crew they were very welcoming and the inflight service was impressive and genuine and they actually looked as if they enjoyed their jobs. I have had the complete opposite experience with premier airlines such as British Airways. Landed on time. Coming back to Gatwick I had a similarly good experience. The crew were again very attentive and quick to ready some cooked food I ordered during the inflight service which was of very good quality considering they are a low cost carrier. Again the aircraft was not a new Sky interior fitted one but still clean and comfortable. Overall I was very impressed with Norwegian's short haul service it was just as good as their long haul one. I have never been so impressed with a cabin crew's service on a short haul flight before. The only downside is the lack of in flight entertainment on short haul flights. I will certainly look to fly Norwegian whenever possible as unlike other low cost carriers such as Easyjet who claim to be cheap Norwegian are actually cheap with excellent fares.

The Dreamliner seats are small and uncomfortable. I am only 5ft 7"" and my knees were touching the back of the seat in front of me. The food was disgusting and I laughed when they would only allow each passenger 1 sugar packet for their tea or coffee as they forgot to restock. They had also forgotten to put onboard the landing cards for arrival so it was a mad scramble at immigration to fill them out. The return journey was worse. I checked in and requested an emergency exit seat knowing how cramped I was on the outbound flight which I got. My relief didn't last long though when I checked in to the gate they informed me they had changed aircraft and there were no emergency exit seats left so they put me at a window seat. The aircraft they changed to was an Airbus 330 no seat back TV's and the sound wasn't working on the over head television.

Norwegian customer review,1,2015-04-16,Travelling from Edinburgh to Stockholm with a connection at Copenhagen. It was a poor experience altogether. Check-in at Edinburgh was a nightmare. We had to queue up for more than an hour even though we only had hand luggage to carry. No fast check-in was available and there were only 2 members of staff to assist a very busy flight. Both flights were delayed. The second flight (CPH-ARN) was delayed by almost 2 hours because we were waiting for the aircraft to come from Tel Aviv.

Norwegian customer review,,2015-04-16,Similar problem with another reviewer earlier essentially short noticed cancellation of flight from LAX to LGW via text on the morning of the flight. The explanation was another flight was delayed due to weather and as part of the chain reaction our flight was cancelled and replaced by HiFLY a full 24 hours later. I asked about reimbursement of repaid accommodation in London and nobody knew. Instead said I would have to wait until midnight when the Oslo office opens.

The plane was probably from the 80s one that had no media screens no audio of any sort food was terrible and frankly the crew were not the nicest. I was late for my Eurostar connection in London.

Norwegian customer review,1,2015-04-16,HEL-AGP on Norwegian and although we are very active travellers this was our first experience with Norwegian. First we found out that unlike any other airline we've experienced Norwegian didn't allow us to gate check our son's stroller. Next we were told the departure is delayed by an hour which turned into over two hours in the end. Then we had a problem with the car rental we had booked through Norwegian as Norwegian hadn't informed the rental company (Avis) of our flight number. Because of that we almost ended up stranded at the Malaga airport with no rental car. On the way back we received a text message from Norwegian telling us the flight back will be delayed by over two hours. To avoid waiting at the airport we stayed at our hotel and arrived at the airport check-in desk about 1.5 hours later than originally scheduled to match the new departure time as we were told by the airline. Only to find out that the departure time had been changed again now to an earlier time and so we missed our flight! We weren't the only passengers who were left behind in Malaga because of the confusing text messages from Norwegian. The airline re-routed us home on another flight through Stockholm and again there were delays. In the end as we finally arrived in Helsinki again Norwegian had lost some of our luggage. And the customer service line was completely closed on the weekend. We've learned our lesson now to never again fly Norwegian.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,1,,False,
Norwegian customer review,8,2015-04-16,"From Orlando Florida on March 24 to Oslo Norway. After about 3 hours in those so called better seats it was not comfortable at all. I got up and walked many times. I knew about the meals situation and did not order anything nor did I have a checked in bag. Anyone that did not know about ordering meals during booking does not read what is there. I got a flight from point A to point B cheap safe and on time. I picked up a couple of sub sandwiches before we left Orlando along with a bottle of water. I saw what fellow passengers were given for a meal and I was glad I had my subs.

Norwegian customer review,10,2015-04-16,FCO-ARN. Line for check-in was long but moved very quickly. Once on board service was extremely efficient and pleasant. Flight attendants were attentive friendly and welcoming. Seats were a bit hard but comfortable while legroom was excellent for a low-cost airline. Flight was half empty so it definitely made the flight more comfortable. BOB Menu was extensive I think the best LCC menu I've ever encountered. Prices were good and the quality of the meals were great. I'll have to say it was one of the best meals I had on a plane and I absolutely have no complaints about paying for it granted I'm getting better quality food. On board WiFi was complimentary and worked great and even had a flight tracker and free TV shows. Overall a truly excellent airline.

Norwegian customer review,,2015-04-12,Sent my 18 yr old daughter from London to Orlando. Had to make a diverted landing to Ft Lauderdale due to weather. They sat on the plane for 1+ hours waiting to get to Orlando. Then they were ordered to deplane as they were not flying out. Originally the staff told all the passengers they were accommodating them with bus tickets or hotels for the night hoping to fly the next day. 1 hr later they recanted their offer and told them all to accommodate themselves to get to Orlando. The Norwegian staff walked out from their post and left everyone there with no directions stating no guarantee of a flight out of Ft Lauderdale the next day. My 18 yr old daughter spent the night alone in the airport with no food and no hotel accommodations. I called the airline and was met with the canned answers of we told everyone to make their own accommodations. My daughter had no credit card to get a hotel room. and it was beyond the hours of food service in the airport at this time. Unacceptable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Norwegian customer review,10,2015-04-08,6th April 2015 Long Haul LGW-JFK 12A. Booked this flight when it was released six months ago and paid just £204 for the ticket plus £40 for a suitcase seat reservation and meals. Our departure time was 18.00 but we pushed back ten minutes early and were in the air at 18.10. Flight landed 45 minutes ahead of schedule but took 15 minutes to reach the gate at JFK which nobody minded. The main difference I noticed on the Boeing 787 was that it hardly felt as if I was on a flight. The windows were enormous. Changes of lighting happened gradually which in some ways was pleasant. The entertainment system was of a very high quality. The fact that I had to bring my own headphones (you have to purchase them on Norwegian) actually made that aspect of it more satisfactory. The seat was also comfortable. I'm 6 foot 2 and didn't feel cramped. There was a hot meal a chicken and rice dish served after takeoff and a cold sandwich meal before landing. That was for those who pre-ordered meals or had to because they wanted checked luggage. Terminal 1 at JFK was crowded and unpleasant and immigration was very confusing but it's never an easy process when entering the US. When I got through 20 minutes later my suitcase had just arrived on the belt so it wasn't an issue. That's not really to do with the airline anyway.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Norwegian customer review,3,2015-04-06,Travelling from JFK to LGW on 2 Apr 15 had a terrible trip. First they changed the aircraft but that was ok as we found the old Emirates plane quite comfortable in fact. Then as we arrived at 16.00 from Raleigh we found the flight was changed from 22.50 to 05.00 next day. There was not one person in the airport we could speak to and as we had no local mobile service and Wifi was not free we struggled to contact the contact centre. Had we been able to get free phone calls as EU rules advise we would have cancelled and taken an evening flight with another airline. But we had to wait till 19.30 to speak to a rep- too late for a discussion about a refund. Other EU rules disregarded by Norwegian - no hotel and transport to hotel offered though this would have been reasonable given the huge delay. We got food vouchers for 18 dollars per person which we had to spend by 23.00 as all catering closed then. Then we slept or tried to sleep in a neon lit noise filled lounge in upright seats as not other option except the floor. There were families with children toddlers old people (me included there) all stranded and ignored. The only reason I give a satisfaction score above zero is because the outward flight was reasonable though still late off the tarmac. Wish I had heeded other reviews. We like a bargain and were happy with the price but this company is not offering any kind of value for money so we will not use them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,2,,False,

Dep: DY7045 Mar 31 3015: Helpful check in. Lounge access. Priority boarding. Welcoming cabin crew. Pre-flight drinks. Departure on time. Delicious beef with potatoes served as main meal. Wine kept flowing. Armchair leather seats made me feel at home. Best blanket I've had on any airline. Larger than average individual pull-out movie screen. Great windows and cabin lighting. Spacious feel to a well-designed cabin. Larger than BA or Virgin toilet which was very clean. Auto-sensor flush and tap with hot and cold water. Good pre-landing snack with tasty ham salad and warm scone with clotted cream and jam. Cabin crew stayed attentive and friendly throughout.

First on the morning of the departure date I received a text message informing me that we would not be flying in a Norwegian Airlines aircraft but on a HiFly Airbus. I paid to travel on a Norwegian aircraft but had to travel on a low quality aircraft. Secondly the flight was delayed by 6 hours so I had to wait around the airport for hours. Norwegian refused to offer any compensation and did not even allow me to speak to a manager when the customer service advisor was rude and unhelpful on the phone. I will never travel with them again.

Norwegian customer review,5,2015-04-01,Flight was from Oslo to JFK in New York. The flight was almost five hours late in departing. The unacceptable part was that at no time was I informed that passengers need to pre-order food for the flight before they board while they are booking the trip. As a result while passengers sitting next to me got a full meal there were many like myself who were told that we are not getting a meal. Three hours into the flight I was able to beg a sandwich and a drink. Norwegian did not even supply water. After sitting at a gate that had no food options available I boarded the flight already famished only to be told that I was not getting food. Had I been the only passenger not knowing this I would think that perhaps I was at fault but there were many passengers like myself left hungry. This is completely unacceptable for a long-haul flight. Surely Norwegian could send out an email to passengers letting them know that they need to pre-order their food or go hungry.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,3,,False,
Norwegian customer review,8,2015-04-01,Flew out LGW-FLL 13th March and returned JFK-LGW 24th March. Flight out was good had prepaid for our seats and meals got seats 34AC both ways which was a row of 2 seats felt very roomy the rows of 3 did look a bit cramped. Vegetarian meal was ok snack later on in the flight was not a very tasteless tomato and cucumber sandwich which they also served for breakfast on the return flight. Inflight entertainment a lot better than BA or Virgin. Arrived 45 minutes early in FLL however left the airport nearly 3 hours later due to the shambles of FLL arrivals moved from room to room joining queue after queue! However was advised by the rental car bus driver that they are building a new international terminal which will hopefully solve this issue. Flight back was also on time crew were very noisy laughing and talking loudly throughout the flight in the galley so could not get any sleep however that may have been a downfall of seats at the back of the plane. Encountered very bad turbulence for the last 3 hours of the flight if a dreamliner is meant to make it more comfortable I would hate to be flying through that in a 777!

Norwegian customer review,6,2015-03-20,Used Norwegian Airlines to fly from LGW to LAX. Overall satisfactory but one incident on the return flight spoiled it all a bit. The outgoing flight was around 45 minutes late departing but did arrive to LAX on time. Food was pretty poor on this flight undercooked risotto is not a particular favourite of mine! Sandwich snack towards the end was also a poor vegetarian option a couple of pieces of bread with some cucumber and tomato thrown between them. Staff were pleasant enough mainly Americans. The plane itself was comfortable with good entertainment facilities. The new design made flying through turbulence a lot more pleasant than normal. However on the return flight we seemed to have mainly Scandinavian flight crew and I was disappointed with how they treated the older gentleman sitting next to me. His entertainment system was broken as soon as we arrived on the plane. He caught a male member of staff as we were taking off who just waved a hand dismissively at him and walked on. He caught another male member of staff who said that if he had already reported it they were probably in the process of resetting his system. Still nothing and eventually a female member came up asked if it still wasn't working and then disappeared to the front of the plane. The screen was never fixed no other member of staff offered help or even an apology. There were empty seats at the front of the plane so he could have been moved. He was wearing a hearing aid and had to put this in every time he was trying to catch a member of staffs attention. It was heartbreaking seeing him rushing to do this and being ignored. I did offer him my TV as I could share with my husband but leaning over someone else isn't quite the same. The flight itself was on time and the American flight food was much better just a shame about the crew.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,True,

How odd it was that we were not even notified that we were flying into an air strike that had already started! Severely annoyed at the total lack of communication shown by this airline. We only found out that our flight had been cancelled up to Tromso by testing our non existing translation skills on a news report! All internal flights cancelled yet no one tells us anything on the email. Trying to call or have live chat was a complete disaster zone as we just couldn't get through. Poor show Norwegian very poor show!

Norwegian customer review,,2015-03-09,Due to fly to Tromso from LGW today for trip of a lifetime to see the Northern Lights. It wasn't to be. Norwegian pilots went on strike over the weekend but that was not supposed to affect non domestic flights today (Monday afternoon). We watched the Oslo flight depart and went to the gate when advertised 50 minutes before departure. As we reached the gate something was clearly wrong. I asked if the flight was cancelled and was told that they were just looking into it. So I checked the airlines website. The flight was cancelled. People were called to get refunds for their duty free. Still no announcement that the flight was cancelled. The rest of us were asked to collect or baggage. At no time was the flight announced as cancelled. We queued to rebook but it was clear that we would miss half of our short break. Apparently the pilot due to take the plane to Tromso had not reported to work. I would have appreciated some information clear and concise about what was happening. I had to resort to Twitter and the company's website and this simply isn't good enough. I will never recommend the airline to friends or business colleagues and on a personal level I am bitterly disappointed not to be visiting Norway to see the aurora borealis which was a long held wish which my wife had bought for me as a Christmas present.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,1,,,,,False,
Norwegian customer review,8,2015-03-04,I flew from LGW to FLL on the 30th January and came back on the 7th February. The flight over left on time and even got in a little early to FLL. The AV equipment did not work on the entire flight but I know this can happen with any airline and I came prepared with shows to watch on my laptop. The staff were no doubt under stress but I found them to be very pleasant and friendly. Food was excellent if you're wondering if you need it on the flight I'm not sure I probably didn't. But as I'm lactose intolerant it was nice to have a very tasty and fresh tasting meal. Definitely one of the best meals I've had flying out of the States. The outbound flight was rather noisy due to the lack of entertainment and people not reserving seats so not sitting with their party I found it hard to rest even with my noise cancelling headphones. FLL arrivals was a nightmare - do not plan on being through in less than two hours! The flight back was excellent entertainment was pretty limited though. I slept for over 6 hours of the flights so I really didn't mind it at all! I would fly Norwegian again but you do have to brace yourself a little for the experience.

Norwegian customer review,4,2015-02-24,Yesterday my family and I flew Norwegian from London Gatwick to New York JFK. The flight was supposed to depart at 6.10pm and actually left at 6.32 which was fine no big deal. We knew that we are in for no service at all the entire flight since we had not booked meals. This really was not that bad because the entertainment system was the best I have ever seen. The touch screens are the most responsive in the air! Our real problem was landing at JFK. There was weather issues at JFK resulting in hundreds of delays and cancellations so we were lucky to land. All the international gates were in use and couldn't unload the plane. This resulted in numerous trips around the airport going to gates that claimed to be open. We need up being on the tarmac for about 2 hours and 50 minutes. The really annoying thing was that the crew was just sitting in the back of the plane on their phones. The customer rights on Norwegian state that food and drinks will be provided on tarmac delays in the USA for over 2 hours. When we finally got off we went to customs which had an extremely long line with 3 officers working. After waiting for a half hour in the customs line we looked for the claim that ha our bags. There was not one screen with our flight information on it so we resorted to asking passengers where they were coming from until we found our golden ticket. We retrieved 2 bags within 15 minutes and the other we kept on waiting on. Only one baggage cart was used for the massive plane so 30 bags would come then wait 20 minutes. It was extremely inefficient and caused commotion after being on a plane for 11 hours and it was 1:45 in the morning. We finally got the last bag at 1.57am.

Norwegian customer review,5,2015-02-24,Really enjoyed the comfort and efficiency of the newer aircraft. The cabin crew were pointedly rude and dismissive to any passengers who had not ordered a meal service in advance and overly obsequious to those who had. We had ordered a meal service which meant we also had complementary drinks and snacks. The other passengers even children were left for hours without even a drink of water. When the lovely family sitting next to us asked for water for their young well-behaved children they waited patiently for 45 minutes and finally the dad had to go back and pick up water himself. They had not had a drink for over 5 hours. Our flight was changed several times after booking which made it tricky with connecting flights but Norwegian is definitely the cheapest way to fly from US to Europe if you can handle the rudeness of the cabin staff who we noticed being particularly harsh with all parents who were traveling with children.

Perhaps I chose the wrong day as the good flight experience was marred by awful ground handling at Fort Lauderdale. Firstly we had to be bussed from the aircraft to another terminal with no priority for Premium Class passengers rather treated like cattle and pushed on to the bus. No cattle would have been better treated! Usual chaos at US immigration with no control of passengers although I cannot blame Norwegian for that. Worst experience was waiting 2 hours after arrival for the luggage to appear with no explanation no apolgy and no Norwegian ground staff present to offer any indication of when the luggage would be delivered.

After 8 hours waiting for a delayed flight and then another 8 hours on a flight this was the worst international flight of my life.

Norwegian customer review,10,2015-01-21,We recently flew Norwegian round-trip from LAX to CPH. I give them a thumbs up. First of all the price is substantially lower than other carriers. Ticket agents and flight attendants were professional and friendly. It as of now is the only non-stop from LA to Scandinavia. People who are quibbling about the add-on prices for baggage food etc. need to consider that this is an improved feature for all travelers. We used to all have to pay for two pieces of luggage free food and alcohol whether we wanted it or not. Now starving college students and budget-minded travelers have a choice and can go to Europe. They can buy a sandwich and bottle of water in the terminal and fly non-stop to Copenhagen for a little over $500 round-trip. That is the fare that two of my relatives obtained who are flying tonight to Copenhagen. That is an amazing fare! If you want food and alcohol and blankets and earphones you have a choice! Choice is good for everyone. By the way nothing is free. You either pay for it with a higher overall fare or you pay for it piecemeal. The in-flight entertainment available in each setback was great and that was free!,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Norwegian customer review,4,2015-01-19,Terribly trained airport staff. Chaos in boarding. Poor communications regarding carry on bags that are taken at the gate.

Norwegian customer review,,2015-01-14,I took an early morning flight (6.30am) to Stockholm Arlanda airport with my 4 month old son. Yes the flight was cheap but it was cheap for a reason. When we arrived at the airport they made us unpack one bag because it was too heavy it seemed like everyone's bags were too heavy because quite a few people including us had to buy excess baggage. It just went downhill after that to be honest. They don't make special provisions for mothers and children. Make you queue for an hour to board the plane then they are completely indifferent to the fact that maybe a mother might need help with her handbag and baby paraphernalia. What infuriated me the most was that the stewardess saw me struggle with my bag and baby but she thought it was a good time to show me how to use the baby seatbelt. Even at the airport when they placed my pram with the heavy baggage no one made me aware. I was fraught and teary eyed time I got to my relatives place. With the help of two good Samaritans I was able to collect my baggage and pram. Again the airport staff at the Arlanda were cold and indifferent. Overall it was the worst experience of my life. Never again will I fly with Norwegian Airlines. I do not recommend that first time mothers fly with them. I repeat they do not have any specific rules when it come to people with children unlike British Airlines.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,3,,False,

Norwegian customer review,8,2015-01-14,Flew Norwegian from ORY to LAX via CPH on 1/3/15. Both the 737-800 from ORY to CPH and the 787-8 from CPH to LAX were clean and comfortable. Both flights were packed but service were efficient if unremarkable. The check-in line at ORY was very long and slow with only 3 agents but since we got to the airport early enough it was not a problem and there were no drama regarding making the flight. The LAX leg left CPH a bit late but made up the time and landed a bit early. 1st time flying 787 and were impressed with the plane. The large window and lower altitude cabin seems to help my daughter with her typical nausea during flights. Best of all is the cost as Norwegian was significantly lower than any other carriers.

I was very disappointed with the flight in view of the cost. I have flown to the Far East many times and expected the same standard of food service etc. I am in my late 70's and feel the cold. I had to purchase a blanket. On Far East flights which are cheaper than Norwegian you also receive a pillow.

Norwegian customer review,2,2015-01-11,Flew with Norwegian yesterday CPH-ALS with stop over in Oslo. The first plane was delayed 1 hour meaning I had 10 min to catch connecting flight before departure. However I needed to transfer the luggage myself and make an additional check-in this being Norwegian law. I asked at check in if I could get some help through the fast lane security clearance or any assistance since I would be stuck in Oslo otherwise. They offered me the chance to buy it even though it was their flight that caused the delay in the first place. Fortunately ALS flight was also delayed one hour in the end so I managed to get on. In addition they have started with the same concept as Ryanair you will have to fit your duty-free purchase in the hand luggage otherwise you have to pay.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,1,,False,
Norwegian customer review,10,2015-01-11,It was our first time flying with Norwegian and after reading some of the comments I was quite anxious. I was flying with my little boy and was worried more about his comfort on this long flight. On arrival at Gatwick airport we checked in promptly most of the staff were nice enough. The flight arrived on time and we were allowed to board. The plane was very modern and clean and the entertainment provided was excellent. With so many films games music and activities available free of charge I didn't need to have packed onboard activities for my son. Food service was prompt and was to a good standard as plane food goes it better then any other airline I have used. The flight was smooth and we were kept fully updated and arrived at out destination on time. The only thing I would say is to purchase snacks at the airport at the selection of food and drink from the snack bar isn't great also I didn't like the fact you can only make purchases using a debit/credit card!,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Norwegian customer review,1,2015-01-05,High fares low service and reliability! Flight from Munich to Las Palmas (one-way ticket was app. EUR 500). Started with a delay of nearly 2 hours. No information nor apologies. The small choice of food or beverages onboard had to be paid. Even the water despite the delay. Seats not very comfortable service from cabin crew below standard even for low-cost carriers. Free WiFi onboard.

Norwegian customer review,2,2015-01-05,Norwegian just lost another 3 customers. We were pleased when they launched their London Gatwick to Rome service as we go to Rome quite frequently. Christmas 2013 they were superb. Amidst considerable chaos at Gatwick they left pretty much on time and got us there fine. However since then they managed to give my wife a 6 hour delay (Rome to London Gatwick) at Easter 2014 turning a late night flight into an early morning flight. Last night - Dec 28th 2014 - my daughter and I were on the 21.55 from Rome to Gatwick which suffered a 4 hour delay and I finally got to bed at 6.30am. They were also an hour late on the outbound flight. My advice would be to avoid. The late evening slot they have at Rome means a delay does turn into a real inconvenience particularly if you are supposed to go to work next day. Communication from their customer service staff almost non existent. Got the feeling they were scared of us and that these delays were pretty common. Also nothing to do with Norwegian but Rome Fiumicino airport is pretty awful for being stuck at late at night. Everything shut no food or drink and horrible metal chairs with fixed metal armrests so you can't lay out on even though there was plenty of space. People started laying on the floor. Anyway on 6 flights we have had a 1 hour a 4 hour and a 6 hour delay so I'm not interested any more fortunately London to Rome I have many options.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,3,,False,
Norwegian customer review,9,2014-12-31,I have flown Norwegian both to/from the Canary Islands and America. I have not been disappointed on either trip.

Norwegian customer review,7,2014-12-31,As an American who has flown Norwegian from Fort Lauderdale to Copenhagen and from Budapest to Copenhagen I can say the no frills carrier is clean comfortable and safe.

Norwegian customer review,10,2014-12-31,I have travelled more than 50 times between OSL-KBP OSL-WAW and sometimes to Berlin and Edinburgh with Norwegian. It is one of the best airlines in Europe and certainly the best low-cost carrier. I have always met friendly crew Norwegian has more flights in time than most other airlines (read the statistics) very cheap tickets new planes smooth check-in reminder on SMS I don't care if the sandwiches on board is not the best there is and that it cost extra money .More important is that I last year have problems with a knee and every time I got very good assistance both in OSL and KBP.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,
Norwegian customer review,8,2014-12-31,I have flown Norwegian twice one LGW to Stockholm and the other time LGW to LAX. The fleet is new and I particularly enjoyed the 787 Dreamliner I flew LGW to LAX on. No its not Emirates or Virgin but it doesn't purport to be. They are trying to make the cost of flying cheaper. I saved £300 per ticket on the LGW /LAX return fare and there were four of us travelling - so a great saving! Yes the food service isn't free and neither are the blankets or the bags but this is outweighed by the price the aircraft quality and the friendly staff. We will definitely fly with them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,True,
Norwegian customer review,10,2014-12-22,"My flight with Norwegian from Oslo to Bangkok on December 10 was a pleasant surprise. I had flown the QR Dreamliners from SIN to DOH and DOH to OSL so I was waiting to be disappointed. Norwegian's version of the Dreamliner is a dream to fly. The seating and legroom felt more spacious and the inflight entertainment system was one of the most responsive I have experienced. The choice of movies and other entertainment was more than enough for our 11 hour + journey. Remember this is a budget airline but at least they provided good Norwegian water during the whole flight. No WiFi on board this flight though and that will have been awesome. Very impressive ""low cost"" airline.",False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Norwegian customer review,,2014-12-22,My family and I were held up in traffic on the M25 but arrived at Gatwick just in time to clear security and board the flight. Norwegian did not provide any assistance in clearing security and did not inform the gate that a party of 5 people had been issued with boarding cards and were expected to join the flight. Norwegian did not arrange for any tannoy announcements that may have allowed us to clear security quickly. When we arrived at the gate it was closed and we had to wait for an hour in the departure area before being allowed to leave. Norwegian then stated that the cheapest alternative flight to our destination was about 700 GBP and that this offer would only be available for a short time. On refusing the offer and returning home I managed to book an alternative flight for 450GBP. Staff service has thus been rated as very poor.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,False,
Norwegian customer review,10,2014-12-22,Norwegian charges you for everything. Want to check a bag? Charge. Want something to eat on an international flight? Charge. Want to reserve a seat? Charge. But in the end it was still cheaper than any other airline. We flew on one of the new Dreamliners from Barcelona to Oakland. Most comfortable international flight I've taken. I'm thin and I inevitably leave the plane with sore hipbones and tailbone. This was the first time ever that I left the flight pain-free. Nice seats great to have wifi on the flight good entertainment in a very wide range of recent movies. The food was decent nothing to write home about. I had a good long nap in their comfy seats got some work done and answered emails on my laptop and watched a movie with my husband.

Norwegian customer review,10,2014-12-18,HEL-ARN-HEL went just fine. B737-800 was brand new with very good legroom and free wifi. Staff was also very nice indeed! Prices are far lower than Finnair and staff is much nicer. Norwegian offers unlimited free wifi during the flight but Finnair only has it on some planes and they charge a rip-off price of $23 for 20 megabytes.

Norwegian customer review,,2014-12-18,One-way CPH-FLL flight on Norwegian. It was by far the worst experience I have had onboard any aircraft. The aircraft flown was not a Dreamliner as I was lead to believe - it was an unmarked charter HiFly plane with an absolute minimum level of comfort. I had paid for a Premium seat which I had flown and enjoyed on previous Norwegian flights - but as the aircraft was substituted only a few premium seats were available and primarily occupied by Norwegian employees with their badges showing. The rest of us including those who were supposed to be seated in Premium were forced to sit in sub-par coach seats. It's not as much being denied the expected level of comfort but the behavior of an airline that downgrades its paying customers with no notice and no options while comfortably taking care of its employees on an 11 hour transatlantic flight. The only bright spot was the onboard Service Director who was very kind and actually told me how sorry he was for what even he agreed was a horrible experience for customers on-board.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,1,,False,
Norwegian customer review,8,2014-12-18,Had 3 flights to/from Gatwick - to/from Faro Larnaca Lanzarote over the past 3 months. The Faro flight was very uncomfortable as it was so hot and stuffy - and you cant escape it but after talking to a helpful person in Norway I was assured the other 2 flights would be properly air conditioned which they were. Always prefer airlines where you can adjust seats and that was the case re Lanzarote. The short films would be better if we had headphones and could listen too (or simply listen to music). The free wifi just about allows for emails to be received or sent but you need a well charged device to take full advantage of wifi (or provide a charging point). Slightly confusing in regards to 'flight mode' regulations as clearly it only works if your device is not in flight mode! This is the one airline however where the food and drink options are too limited and lack 'healthy' choices or good veg options - (Easyjet are best for food/drink). Unlike any of the other airlines we have to remember to bring own snacks etc. Finally no hassle with hand baggage which used to be a pre-flight concern with extra stress when flying with Ryanair or Thomas Cook. Easyjet has the best and clearest policy here 'if it fits it is free'!. One tip for all airlines - boarding should start with those seated at the back so front passengers do not hold up others when storing hand luggage.

Norwegian customer review,7,2014-11-25,I flew from Rome (FCO) to Stockholm to Oakland (OAK) on 21 Nov 2014. I was amazed at the price $493 one way including 1 checked bag 1 meal and 2 seat assignments. The next least expensive one way fare was another $450 and one extra stop! Do your homework read the Norwegian.com website to know their policies especially when it comes to checked baggage (20 kilos) and carry on (1 carry-on and 1 small personal bag). I decided to purchase my meal from Norwegian and I'm glad I did. In Stockholm you must clear customs and enter into a gate area specially for flights that are U.S. bound. One inside there is another processing before actually boarding. I thought two hours would be plenty to grab a beer and do a little shopping but after two lengthy line's it wasn't. Once you cross over to the international side there are no places to eat or drink! The first meal was surprisingly tasty I had a choice of Chicken or beef I chose the chicken. It came with two hot sides and a dessert. One drink was included I chose wine and a glass of water. Just before landing we were offered a sandwich and one cold side with coffee tea or water. The movies were all included in the price of the ticket. Do your homework and find out which seats have extra legroom on a 10 hour flight this will make a difference! I was in a bulkhead aisle row 7 the only problem with this seat were careless passengers passing into the galley and stepping on my feet. The seat was comfortable enough definitely bring your own pillow and blanket or just purchase one from Norwegian for $20. I thought the price of drinks spirits beer and snacks was expensive but I did like the option of ordering through my TV screen and having it delivered. I also liked the inflight map showing our route. I would definitely fly with Norwegian again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,True,

It was a whole 8hrs before we were given anything else to eat and was very disappointed with my very small sandwich muffin and apple juice.

The Crew were friendly and the onboard entertainment was good enough. Had heard horror stories about both the Dreamliner and Norwegian but I had a great flight both ways and would fly with them again to the States.

Norwegian customer review,1,2014-11-06,My trip to Europe in October with Norwegian was the worst I have ever encountered. I understand the cost saving and it is cheaper than many other airlines but doesn't mean that it is ok to ignore customers that didn't order food/drink from the menu. My flights were about ten hours long and if I hadn't got up and walked back to the galley for water I would be thirsty the whole time. Since I am picky with food I didn't order a meal but I would never thought that it meant I will be ignored. A smile and an offer with a cup of water won't cost you much and I think that service is the least you could provide.

At sometime around 5AM was called and told me that there is further delay to the schedule and it will now be in the afternoon. So all in all the delay is over 20 hours.

Norwegian customer review,9,2014-10-13,Gatwick-Fort Lauderdale Fri 10/10/14. Quick and easy check in. Flight left about 30 mins late don't think that was Norwegians fault. The Dreamliner was clean and comfortable. Flight attendants a bit moody looked like they didn't want to be there. Got water and pre paid meal choice of chicken or beef with a choice of tea or coffee and a small dessert. Inflight entertainment was good with new movies and good selection of tv shows. Liked the touch screen controls and 3D flight tracker. Windows larger and control dimmer was great also liked the changing mood lighting in the cabin. Didn't sleep will be attempting that on my journey home. Later had a small food box which contained cheese sandwich small chocolate muffin and a carton of apple juice (included for pre-paid price). I recommend you buy your own blanket and pillow pre flight (fleece with blow up pillow in a zip up travel bag) as I did as the plane is kept at a cold temperature. Fort Lauderdale airport is the worst I've ever been to. Had to wait 20 mins for the bus then kept on the bus for 30 mins before being allowed inside the terminal building. We then queued in one line for I don't know how long only for the badly organised staff started bringing people from the back of the line to the front for no apparent reason shifting barriers from side to side - many people not liking this getting irate and could have caused a riot. Getting past this hall only to wait in line in another hall luggage was waiting (had been taken off carousel). Then to wait in line again for customs. 4hrs after landing I left the airport from hell! Not good by this time I had been awake for 24 hrs. And all because an airport could not cope with 2 flights landing in close proximity. Will never use this airport again (apart from my return flight).,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,3,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Norwegian customer review,5,2014-10-13,One way Barcelona to Gatwick.

Norwegian customer review,9,2014-10-12,ARN-LGW-ARN Oct 04-06 on a almost new B737-800. Very smooth boarding and flight took off and landed according to time schedule. Being a low-fare airline getting there on time and in a safe way is priority no 1!

Norwegian customer review,9,2014-10-08,Four of us travelled from Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale on the Dreamliner and we were all very impressed with the plane and the excellent service on board. Fort Lauderdale seems to have a problem with processing the amount of people on the Dreamliner. We arrived on a Friday night and had to wait for buses to take us to the terminal which took ages and then we had to wait outside the terminal as it was full! Took forever to get through customs even with a renewed ESTA! On return we had half hour delay and then had to return to stand because of a faulty switch. The terminal had no announcements to update people and shops and restaurants were shutting early. I would fly with Norwegian again but not to Fort Lauderdale I'm afraid.

Norwegian customer review,10,2014-10-08,Flew CPH-LAX on September 11. The 787 Dreamliner lives up to its name. We were a bit hesitant when we read some bad reviews but the price was less than half the competitors so we went through with it. Inside the plane you will notice that the windows are much bigger and the ceilings are much higher in the cabin. The windows instead of having the shutters are dimmed. The windows in the entire cabin were shaded to the highest level and the mood lights made it feel like night for most of the 11 hour flight so we got lots of sleep before arriving. The inflight entertainment was great with plenty of movies USB and power outlets and the service was fast. I recommend bringing your own food and drink it is very expensive on the plane ($11 for a sandwich).

Norwegian customer review,10,2014-10-05,First time flying with Norwegian from London Gatwick to Los Angeles (LAX). To be honest I was very worried about delays but my 2 flights were on time. I must say I am pretty surprised with the company! The staff was very nice and friendly! My boyfriend is very tall and usually suffers a lot with the seats (no space for his legs) but in both aircraft's he had space and could rest properly. The aircraft is new you have a little screen where you can see films and TV series play games and listen to music. The only thing we didn't like was not being able to buy drinks until the snack bar was opened - our fault as we didn't book the food and drinks when we bought the tickets.

Norwegian customer review,10,2014-10-05,Flew Norwegian Oakland/Stockholm and Oslo/Oakland in premium economy. Great plane nice attendants.

Norwegian customer review,10,2014-10-05,Travelled from London Gatwick to Alicante and it was the best airline yet. We go to Spain regularly and travelled on different airlines but Norwegian airlines was by far the better one the plane was very comfortable not cramped at all and with free wifi and o board entertainment was a big bonus. The cabin crew were very friendly and approachable the take off and landing was very smooth.

Norwegian customer review,3,2014-10-05,Norwegian Flight 7005 Stockholm-New York on August 10 2014. Norwegian aircraft was replaced with Euro Atlantic Airways plane which not only had no USB ports and no WiFi as advertised but also no regular power outlets available for passengers of the Premium class cabin. I was completely unaware about this change and came onboard with low battery on my electronic book. It could be easily avoided if Norwegian use my contact information and informed me about coming change of aircraft. Moreover when I realized that I would not be able to read during the flight I decided to entertain myself with the video. Unfortunately the flight attendant informed me that video displays in Premium class cabin did not work. They tried to reboot the system but with no success. Honestly I am not a big fan of flying and thanks to Norwegian I had over 7 hours of doing nothing. I returned home completely exhausted.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,False,
Norwegian customer review,1,2014-10-01,Never again! Thought we would try this airline as we travel to Florida twice a year. But soon discovered by the time you add all the extras like baggage food headphones blankets and seats you could upgrade on BA. The flight from LGW to Fort Lauderdale was OK ish. Could not book in online prior to flight so given poor seats (was not going to pay extra to reserve). No extra drinks unless you pay exorbitant prices. Had to wait 30 minutes on the runway for buses to take us to the terminal. Our friends travelled to Fort Lauderdale 4 days before and had to wait 40 minutes. Once is bad luck twice is bad planning! Return trip tonight. As their website was down we were unable to book meals. When we rang from Florida told we were too late! How ridiculous is that? Now have the prospect of a 8 hour flight with no food or drink unless we pay their excessive prices! We can't check in online again or use the app. Not looking forward to the return journey at all!

Norwegian customer review,4,2014-10-01,I had flown previous sectors with Norwegian from Gatwick Alicante and Oslo. In comparison this Madrid-Gatwick flight was disappointing. Norwegian does not offer online check-in at T1 Barajas so the only option is to join a slow-moving queue even with hand baggage only. This fact alone would be sufficient for me to choose another of the many airlines flying MAD-LON next time. Security at T1 was poorly organised. Boarding was late and slow. The flight itself was satisfactory although the particular aircraft used had no on-board Wi-Fi which is usually one of the big pluses of flying Norwegian.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,False,
Norwegian customer review,,2014-10-01,Terrible! Will never book with them again. Flights from London Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale times changed by 5/6 hours hence connecting flights from Edinburgh rendered useless. Only discovered the change when an email arrived promoting price reduction on similar flights. Actual notification arrived 12 hours later. Their customer service won't answer phone or emails. Norwegian is worse than Ryanair! I have not flown with them yet and until I can communicate with them I'm not sure I will!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,False,
Norwegian customer review,,2014-10-01,Originally I was attracted to fly on Norwegian airlines by a very good price and a direct flight between JFK and Stockholm on the 787 Dreamliner. I live in Boston and my husband said he would drive me to JFK The morning of the flight I received a text message saying the flight was delayed by 5 hours from 21.35 to 02.35 however to make up for this inconvenience I would be given a free $20 meal voucher. They gave us the meal voucher but didn't tell us that all the restaurants had closed so that was useless. When I did finally board it wasn't a 787 as it said on my ticket but an older plane that had no air conditioning was dirty with trash in the magazine holder and none of the entertainment screens worked and the food was disgusting. My return flight was also booked on a 787 but was on the same plane I flew over on. I switched to the Vegetarian meal which was pasta with spinach on top. The only positive thing I can say is it was a safe trip and that I learned my lesson about a bargain isn't always a bargain.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,False,
Norwegian customer review,9,2014-10-01,No problem with flights took off on time landed on time. Staff were fine they did their job professionally. Problem is the schedule times landing at Gatwick at 12pm waiting 2 hours for a car rental an abysmal drive in traffic lost the entire day. FLL airport: what a dump landed on time then downhill use steps to debark bus to immigration hall held on the bus as immigration was full on line for 2 hours recovering luggage and getting through customs.

Norwegian customer review,,2014-09-28,We asked for a drink once airborne as the stewardess came past and she said that the passengers who had paid for a meal would be served first and that the snack bar would open for all other passengers after this time but she could give us water until then. 3 hours later the snack bar opened. Having to ask for water for 3 hours was totally unacceptable. I have flown with other carriers who open serve the customers who have paid for the meal along with the ones who have opted out but all I was told repeatedly was that I would have to wait until the rest of the passengers were fed and watered many times.

Norwegian customer review,2,2014-09-28,I flew from NY to Rome in September 2014 for the first and hopefully the last time in my life. The flight arrived on time even if we boarded with one hour delay. Ok no problem I told to myself it's very rare to be boarded on time almost everywhere so far. In any case since the beginning the service has been poor and the communications scarce. Nobody knew what was going to happen. Worst of all is that you pay 400 dollars for a one-way ticket which is not a cheap price and you don't even receive a complimentary cup of coffee or tea during your 7-hour flight! Not to mention food - they don't serve anything to drink unless you pay for it not even water which you have to beg for. Blankets and pillows must be paid unless you bring your own blanket or sweater. On the second part of the flight from Copenhagen to Rome they don't serve water. I understand that this is what may happen on a two-hour flight or on short distances but on a seven-hour flight. When food was served on the plane only for whom had paid for it (which you don't know if it has to be done before boarding at the booking time or when you are already on board because nobody tells you anything) and the tray was passing though the aisles with water and other drinks not one of the crew ask if you need water. I asked a hostess how this worked and she replied that I had to book my food in advance.

Norwegian customer review,9,2014-09-28,Had been reading Norwegian reviews here since I booked tickets for the new LGW-JFK service. Both flights left departed and arrived on-time (give or take 10 minutes). The 787 was clean felt new and was comfortable. Legroom was no worse than any other transatlantic economy service (and was certainly not the worst I've encountered). The night flight could be aided by offering quieter announcements the flight leaves at 11pm I'm pretty sure if you haven't eaten or ordered meal service you're ready for sleep. Very loud announcements about duty free shopping at was effectively 3am were unnecessary. Still managed to get a few hours of sleep on the way over despite being in the middle seat and the lack of lumbar support in the seat itself. Toilets were clean and well-stocked. Flight crew was pleasant well-dressed and seemed to be made up of a very diverse group of nationalities. Snack bar service on the return flight was quick and friendly. I wouldn't go out of my way to fly them (price and schedule are key) but definitely wouldn't hesitate booking in the future.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Norwegian customer review,,2014-09-24,Absolutely awful experience. 20 hour delay on Sep 17 from Stockholm to NYC. No hotel. No offer of compensation. The issue was a technical problem due to ventilation. No chance to book a hotel either since they kept moving the departure 2 hours at a time pretty much ensuring that we had to stay by the gate. Supposed to leave on the 17th at 5.30pm. Left at 12.30pm the next day. Slept by the gate with 100s of other passengers. When we did take off - icing on the cake: made us pay for our blankets!

Norwegian customer review,10,2014-09-22,Flew Gatwick to LA for a low cost airline it was fab! Plane was modern the crew were more than pleasant meals were what you expect on a budget airline it really annoys me when people moan about airline food - you're on a budget airline you get what you pay for! If you don't like airline food don't purchase it. Plane left on time and we arrived half an hour earlier. Flight back was excellent also we got to check in and saw a board saying that there were upgrades available so we thought we would ask. They gave us premium seating for two for £200! What a bargain. I've flown premium with other airlines and I've got to say this was the best premium seating I've used seats were huge leg room was excellent.

The cabin crew didn't stop working and nothing was to much trouble. The whole inflight experience was leaps and bounds above other economy airlines we've flown.

Didn't sample anything from the BOB menus as we'd eaten at Weatherspoon's (avoid like the plague at Gatwick food was awful) but they were selling food and drink on board like hot cakes. I had a hand in a splint and the check-in staff were lovely even though we where late checking in making sure I had a seat where I wouldn't get bumped into.

Cabin pressure and temperature spot on. Staff were polite and attentive. I read some terrible reviews about Norwegian (after I had booked my flight) so was quite apprehensive. Couldn't fault them and will definitely fly with them again. My only criticism is the position and angle of the footrest when extended. I'm 6' 2"" with long legs so my feet felt a bit bent backwards.

We had no information about the time we were due to land in London until we actually got there which made our organization for transfers impossible. My fiancé and I couldn't sit next to each other because they gave us seats allocated in different rows despite the fact that I booked those two tickets together 2 months before the flight and that we checked in together as early as possible.

Norwegian customer review,5,2014-09-19,I have a mixed opinion of Norwegian airlines after having flown them R/T LAX-ARN (Stockholm). Flight out from LAX went without a hitch. The flight from LAX to ARN was not on a Dreamliner and the service was traditional with complimentary food and drinks (and headsets) and the flight departed on time. The return flight however was 14 hours delayed. The airline ate the cost of putting all the passengers in a hotel on site at the airport and included vouchers for lunch and dinner. The return flight was on the Dreamliner and that aircraft is so smooth and I'm glad that I got to experience it. Nothing is complimentary on the return flight. Even basic drinks like coffee and soda are $4. Video entertainment however is complimentary and there was no shortage of things to watch.

She reported to us the plane was old and very uncomfortable seating. Once in Copenhagen she was told to find her own hotel and submit a receipt to be reimbursed later. She could find a hotel with any vacancies. The airport tried to help but they couldn't find one either. Forced to stay the duration in the airport.

Norwegian customer review,10,2014-09-17,Great flights! I must admit I had my concerns about travelling with Norwegian after reading some reviews on here but our experience on the 787 Dreamliner was great. We flew London Gatwick to Fort Lauderdale departed on time had pleasant cabin crew great inflight entertainment and the best beef steak I have ever tasted! We decided to upgrade on check-in to Premium Economy and if this option is available I would highly recommend. We paid an extra £180 each to upgrade at last minute and it was worth every penny. The only downside was the delay once we had landed at Fort Lauderdale. Although we landed on time Passport Control and Customs could not handle the sheer volume of passengers/aircraft arriving at the airport at the same time. We were kept waiting a further 2 hours on the aircraft as airport staff would not let us disembark. In total it was 4 hours after landing before we were able to leave Fort Lauderdale airport to begin our holiday. This was the case for every arrival and was not the fault of Norwegian Airlines but it ruined what was otherwise a perfect flight.

The Dreamliner was fantastic sensored dimming windows USB ports on screen and mains power point under every seat. There are more on board facilities than other scheduled airlines. Seats were comfortable and we had enough legroom. My husband and son are tall so had aisle seats. We had no food on board as wanted to keep the cost down but that was fine.

Norwegian customer review,8,2014-09-14,"After reading all of the bad reviews we were a bit nervous with the tickets we purchased to travel from Ft Lauderdale to Oslo. We watched this site carefully so I wanted to share our experience. We did not pay for any ""extras"" - advanced seat assignment meals or bags. We traveled only with a carry on it was weighed in FLL when checking in. I think we were a little overweight but they did not charge us. Outbound flight was delayed around 3 hours due to the inbound aircraft being diverted because of a passenger onboard suffering a heart attack. We were told this upon check in and were not upset as we would want the flight diverted if it was our loved one. The Dreamliner was great - no complaints. Note: if you do not pay for their meal you are unable to buy a drink/snack until after the paid meal service is complete. For the return flight from Oslo it was an odd boarding process. They scanned your boarding pass at the gate and you entered a room crowded with other passengers on the flight and waited. When the plane was ready they opened the door and everyone just filed in - no boarding by row zone etc which caused people to all rush the door at once. It was odd.

Norwegian customer review,8,2014-09-14,I was very apprehensive after booking my flight with Norwegian. I was told to read reviews which were not good. I left LAX airport heading for Gatwick London. The flight was on time the cabin staff friendly food was great. I got to speak with the pilots prior to boarding. Boarding was fast. Very enjoyable flight. My flight out was on Sunday August 17th arriving on 18th. My flight back was from Gatwick to LAX on September 7th. Flight was again on time little slow taking off due to run way being busy. This time the cabin was dirty huge dirty spot next to my seat and trash in the pocket. They ran out of options for the 1 st meal served however the food served was good. Not my choice but not too bad at all. The breakfast served was not good. I am very allergic to onions and was served a cheese/onion sandwich. I let the young man know of my serious allergy and he kindly stated he would find me a replacement which he did! However he did not check the replacement and that too had onion in the coleslaw. The coleslaw was inside the sandwich. I was not able to eat it so I was quite hungry when I got off the plane. All in all I would say Norwegian had it right. I am happy I flew with them and would do so again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Norwegian customer review,10,2014-09-14,Having read the extremely mixed reviews about the Norwegian long haul flights and the turbulent history of the Dreamliner I was more than a little nervous about the flight from Gatwick to New York on 9/9/14. However the entire experience from check in to arrival in JFK was fantastic! There was no queue to check in security at the airport was rapid and smooth the Dreamliner was there and it was wonderful! Flight departed on time and arrived an hour ahead of schedule in JFK (however due to congestion we had to wait on the runway for an hour on arriving so no difference in the end). We were in economy and the seats had plenty of leg room and really good inflight entertainment as well as the ability to use your card to pay for things at your seat which was fun. If you pay for food in advance you get 2 meals (one hot one cold) as well as tea and cold drinks. If you don't pay in advance you get nothing (you can pay for cold snacks separately if you wish) so bring your own food and drink. The flight cost £300 one way (Virgin is £999) so you really cannot get better value.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,

We find out on the day of the flight that there was a stopover in Iceland (that they added without telling anyone). The flight was delayed by over an hour. Plus this extra 2.5 hours because they needed to refuel this incredibly out of date plane they put us on. No Dreamliner for us. No TV. My seat wouldn't recline. The service was awful.

Norwegian customer review,8,2014-09-10,Flew Gatwick - Arrecife - Gatwick. We flew with Norwegian as part of a package holiday booked through Monarch. At first we were surprised that we were flying with Norwegian instead of Monarch due to Monarchs flights being full. We were a bit concerned when we found out that the airline was a low cost airline but we were extremely impressed. Our outbound flight was on the 29/8/14. We used there self-service check in and it took no more than two minutes to print our boarding pass and drop our bags off and we were through security and airside within 5 minutes. The flight was 10 minutes delayed but the flight still managed to land so early that our coach wasn't even ready for us. Coming back on the 5/9/14 check-in was a nightmare we were in the middle of the queue for check in and still had to wait over 50 minutes it was only after about 30 minutes that they decided to open another check-in desk taking it up to two. The flight however still managed to board quickly and pushed back 10 minutes early. The aircraft we flew on was fairly new and had Boeings new cabin lighting which was really relaxing and changed colours. Cabin crew were smart professional and friendly and although you had to buy your own drinks and snack on the flight (very expensive but it's how they make their money) the service was very good. The plane had wifi and they use the wifi to display the flight details and flight map rather than on the overhead screens. Inflight entertainment was available on your phone/ipad/laptop for 7 euro but for a part of the flight they had short films playing on the screens such as Tom and Jerry. The only thing I can fault about the actual flight is that I found the seats fairly hard but at the end of the day the flight was less than 4 hours.

Norwegian customer review,1,2014-09-10,"Norwegian is cheap because the cost includes nothing and because the seat spacing is absolutely terrible. Not comparable to a ""normal airline"" watch out! Flew from LGW to JFK. I am quite tall and the seat spacing is on par with Ryanair for local flights. For an 8hr intercontinental flight this is torture. In addition the ""pre-booked"" meal thing means I had no food for most of the flight. There is no good warning about this before you book. Prices for snacks etc. are ludicrous even for in-air standards. Flight delayed 1h which is not a lot in the grand scheme of things but if you don't fit in the seat it is certainly an added bonus. My point is: the flight is terrible if you are not really small even when the ""Dreamliner"" is available and you are not delayed. If you really must compare on price make sure to add another 100 pounds for luggage/meal. Then factor in that you get much more space in the economy class of other airlines.",False,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,2,,False,

Norwegian customer review,1,2014-09-06,"We were due to fly to Fort Lauderdale on Friday 25th July. We arrived at Gatwick at 1pm for a 4.30 flight only to be informed by the check in staff that the flight was 'delayed'. We were given meal vouchers and a room at the Hilton. On the Norwegian website the flight was scheduled for 11pm that night. However a letter pushed under the hotel room door informed us we were delayed until 6am Saturday. This later turned into 8am on Sunday. We had seen that a Norwegian flight was delayed in LA - I asked the ground staff at the Norwegian desk if this was our plane; they were quite dismissive and uninterested and said ""No definitely not. Your plane is here but has technical issues"". After a second night in Gatwick we went to the check in desk on Sunday 27th July only to be told the plane was delayed a further two hours. At 10am the gate number flashed up on the screens. At last! when we got to the gate we were further informed there would be yet another hour's delay. At 11am an announcement told passengers that the flight may not depart as it had not been catered! At this point there was uproar and people demanded to go even without any food. Suddenly there was food and we took off about noon. The cabin crew were pleasant and chatting to one I was informed that this was the plane delayed in LA as he was crewing and had also been delayed! So why did Norwegian lie? The plane was freezing and yet there were no blanket unless you paid - the A/C was unnecessarily high and I am sure this was a ploy. Because of the 44 hour delay we lost a hotel booking for the 25th and our car hire was cancelled.

Norwegian customer review,8,2014-09-06,Following all the negative reviews of the transatlantic service I was somewhat nervous about our London Gatwick - JFK return flights. However I have to say that the whole experience was as good as economy class air travel gets these days. Norwegian is using the budget airline model for this service so if you have to be realistic in that you will either have to pay for everything or take it yourself (drinks snacks pillows blankets etc.). We did a combination of both. All the staff we dealt with were professional and polite we travelled on the Dreamliner both ways which was comfortable and had no issues with the entertainment systems that others have described. We were delayed on the return leg of the journey however this was not the airlines fault as someone had checked a bag and then not turned up for the flight we had to wait while their bags were removed. My only negative comment is that Norwegian put the time of the return flight back by several hours after we had made our reservations. Although we had a lot of notice of this and were offered the option to cancel the flight we were unable to re-arrange our plans as we had already booked connecting flights etc. As we were travelling with young children this was a real pain.

Norwegian customer review,1,2014-09-01,"When customers pay you for a flying experience aboard the Dreamliner that is what we expect to receive. Instead they switched everyone onto an ancient TV-less smaller non-direct flight due to the Dreamliner being ""unavailable"". I'm sorry to inform you however that when a plane is not booked enough and you don't want to waste money you can't just say that the original plane is no longer available. What you do is suck up the losses like a real company and fulfil customers' orders at a loss. Due to this unfair decision passengers had their direct flight aboard the Dreamliner changed into a 2.5 hour flight to Iceland a 1 hour refuel where everyone was stuck onboard and then an 8.5 hour flight to Oakland. Because of your decision to change your passengers to a smaller plane not capable of making the entire trip from Norway to Oakland without a refuel you wasted about 4 hours of our time.

Norwegian customer review,9,2014-09-01,In July 2014 I flew Norwegian from Bangkok to Oslo Oslo to Bergen and Bergen to Paris (Orly) with my wife and young daughter. The price (and the chance to fly a 787 Dreamliner) was what attracted us but we were very happy with the whole experience. All flights were pretty much on time (give or take 10 mins). The Dreamliner was great. The seat space was equivalent to the Qantas A330 we flew Sydney to Bangkok. The pre-ordered (Thai) meal was good and the inflight snack purchase system was fun (swipe your credit card in the entertainment system and order from there). The inflight entertainment was also great both the selection and the system. The Norway / Paris flights were straightforward but good. Leg room was reasonable (I'm 6' 4) especially compared to other LCCs. And the in flight magazine was well worth reading. Hopefully the teething problems that people reported with the Bangkok - Oslo flights have been worked through because I really buy into the ethos of Norwegian.

The flight was outsourced to Euro Atlantic which was an old dirty plane and there was no announcement or notification about this change which included the flight now have a two and half hour stop for refuelling in addition to the one original delay. The lack of customer service was the most frustrating because it can easily be improved with more honest communication.

No delays at all and cabin crew very welcoming. Window dimming system is a nice idea and blocks out the sun quite well. Inflight entertainment is pretty good couple of older films and not that much for kids though. All flight attendants were great and reassured us during turbulence. The LED system was used well.

Heading up our company in this region I wanted to try out the highly advertised Dreamliner to and from New York. Traveling to NY from CPH was fantastic. I had booked Premium class. Going to NY I enjoyed the great seats and also quite good service. Norwegian had the return flight operated by ""Titan Airways"" a budget carrier from the UK. With an all coach seating arrangement. Norwegian did not inform us despite their website saying that if a different plane is used the customer will get informed prior to the flight. The check in people at JFK said this other plane had also premium seats. So do did the gate crew. All lies. One of my fellow travelers noticed that on his reservation document from 1 week before the trip it already said ""Titan Airways operated"" meaning that Norwegian already knew before the outbound trip that the return flight would not be the Dreamliner. Norwegian however sold us Premium tickets for both Outbound and inbound flight. I have traveled a lot throughout my career but have never seen airline just advertising one product but selling another without telling the customer. Not at the time of buying nor at the time of check-in. Besides the fact that the premium class customers had to travel unexpectedly in a very tight coach seat they now also need to go through the hassle of claiming money back.

We didn't have a chance to book much in advance but while most airlines were quoting $2000 Norwegian was quoting $1500 and that's the reason we picked them. My trip out was in economy and the leg room for a 6'1"" guy is not the best. I felt really cramped but other airlines are probably doing the same thing. We prepaid for the food/baggage/seat assignment (included in the $1500) and I recommend anyone do that but don't expect the food to be all that great. The chicken tasted boiled. On the way back I opted for premium economy. It was about $300 more which is not bad compared to other airlines but the only real pluses are increased leg room and a 2 suitcase allowance rather than 1 and slightly better food. The beef I had was not bad at all! You get a free glass of so-so wine with the meal and a Bailey's to cap it off (premium economy only) but I found it weird that I still had to cough up $7 for a beer later in the flight! Really? The movie choice was limited - I didn't know most of the titles but I guess there was enough choice to keep me amused. The electrochromic windows are weird.

I have recently flown with them for the first time Long Haul from LGW-JFK out on 7th August 2014 returning overnight on 12th/13th August 2014. I have to say that apart from a small delay on the outgoing flight the all round experience was excellent. 787 Dreamliner planes were comfortable and actually felt less cramped than larger planes on other UK airlines flying the same route. I had booked the extra legroom seats (rows 7 and 24 respectively) grab them if you can! Inflight entertainment system was like having your own ipad state of the art and more reliable than other systems I have experienced with alternative British carriers. I actually managed to sleep a little on the return overnight flight which is a first for me on a long haul flight and I had little jet lag as a consequence. Cabin crew were efficient and friendly and the ambient lighting and windows which have automatic filtering depending on the external conditions were remarkable.

I opted for the Premium Economy service as that was their top tier class and I was over the moon with the whole entire experience. The worst thing about the flight was having to fly from Gatwick south terminal which is just awful however everything about Norwegian was top class. The premium economy seats were extremely comfortable for a non flat bed seat in comparison to Word Traveler Plus on BA it was simply incredible. Right from the offset I had a good experience with the express premium baggage check/check in desk and priority boarding on the flight. The food was presented in a very nice package only down side is that they only had one option of fish available when they reached me (I don't eat fish). However the sides dessert and drinks were delicious. The service was slightly slow but was excellent so didn't mind.

I booked with Norwegian because they offered a unique experience about the 787 and direct flights to NYC. I checked the flight status before leaving for the airport my flight was delayed more than 5 hours with a new departure of 11 pm (instead of 5.30pm). I went to the airport on time to learn that the flight was definitely delayed because of a technical issue on the plane that occurred 2 days ago. After waiting 4 hours at the airport with my luggage we were allowed to drop our luggage and check-in. I waited 1.5 hrs to drop my luggage. At the desk the receptionist discreetly ask me if I would agree to switch to another flight (because of over-booking) the following day and Norwegian would offer me 600€. However they were not able to tell me if the flight would be on time and if over-booking problems would be absorbed. I refused as I had to be in NYC the next day and he gave me a voucher for a meal. We were waiting 45 minutes without any explanations. Finally we took of at 11.45 more than 6 hours after the scheduled departure. The plane was an old and dirty EuroAtlantic plane seats were narrow plane was dirty. The EuroAtlantic crew were welcoming but it didn't change the fact that the plane was so uncomfortable. To return we were on EuroAtlantic again with limited entertainment. The flight was only delayed one hour which was a good surprise. The plane was indeed old with limited entertainment but still better than the first one as we had larger seats and individual screens.

Norwegian customer review,2,2014-08-15,DY7006 1 Aug 2014 New York - Stockholm-Arlanda. The original booking was to take the flight on the Dreamliner but that did not occur and the flight was subcontracted out to Portuguese Air. This appears to be a common practice for this airline and after reading the reviews is the basis of many of the complaints. We booked first class and found accommodations no better than economy. No pillows and few blankets. Flight crew was more interested in socializing during the flight rather than addressing the needs of customers. No entertainment during the entire 7 hour flight. Some of the restrooms were non-functional. Food was substandard. But what concerned me most was a lack of safety culture by the staff. Upon landing customers jumped out of their seats and started removing items from the overhead bins and remained standing as the plane proceeded to the airport. Not a word was said to anyone by the staff. In all my years of travel I have never observed such unsafe behavior.

Norwegian customer review,9,2014-08-14,Paris to Oslo rtn. It was not a new 737 with the sky interior but it was clean and everything worked and the service was wonderful. We were travelling as a family of 7 and the staff were very helpful and friendly. The flight back was on one of their newest 737-800's with the sky interior and it was excellent. Comfortable seats and the WiFi was fast. Very impressed and would certainly fly Norwegian around Europe. The inflight snacks were nice (had the chicken sandwich and it was delicious).

Norwegian customer review,,2014-08-14,I have travelled quite often with Norwegian Air during the past. I have always been satisfied with their service until I travelled on flight DY1633 from Vienna to Oslo on 25 July 2014 when “the walls fell in”. The incoming flight from Oslo was about 3 hours late in arriving in Vienna. The waiting passengers were not aware of the reason for the planes delay in arriving. Shortly after the planes arrival in Vienna 5 or 6 Austrian police appeared and started taking 4 or 5 of the awaiting passengers out for further interrogation. No explanation was given by a member of the ground staff as to the reason for the 3 hour delay in arriving at Vienna which was apparently due to the connecting flight from Bodø to Oslo being delayed 3 hours because of fog. When we got on board at about 00.30 an explanation was given by the Captain as to the delay. Drinks were available on the flight but had to be paid for instead of being offered free of charge after such a long delay. The flight eventually arrived at Oslo Airport at about 03.00 over 3 hours late! As I had 2 tickets for the Airport Train to Sandvika I asked one of the flight attendants how I could get to Sandvika as no trains were available at that late hour. I was given a short rude reply to contact Norwegian Air’s Service company at Oslo Airport. I eventually did and the service company rudely told me to take a waiting bus to Oslo Centre and a taxi on to Sandvika and make a claim to Norwegian Air afterwards. Lack of information and rude flight attendants with in my opinion little experience has made me think twice about travelling with Norwegian Air again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,,,2,,False,
Norwegian customer review,10,2014-08-14,We flew low fare from Fort Lauderdale Florida (FLL) to Copenhagen Denmark (CPH) on August 7. I had read the reviews so I knew what to expect - delays and no frills. Our flight was delayed 1 hour found out via FLL website - no big deal. We did not pre order food baggage or reserve seats. Flying as a couple we checked in together and we assigned consecutive seats. Aircraft was new media selection was good. Hard to sleep - lots of interruptions. There were 9 seats per row so a 3-3-3 set up. It's a 9 hour flight it's an economy airline it's what I expected. Don't buy food on the plane - it' starts at $4 cokes and $8 mini Bailey's. As a couple in our twenties traveling to Europe on a budget it was satisfactory. We have 2 more Norwegian flights while here - will review again. Note on the FLL airport: if you have a late evening flight be prepared that the shops/food close around 8.30 - disappointed not to get a meal. Not even a cup of water will be offered to you on the plane. Headphones/blankets not free. I brought a big sweater - that was a good decision.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Norwegian customer review,2,2014-08-11,I had a one-way flight LAX-CPH Dreamliner. No delay and service was good. The flight was cheap so that was fine. What I didn't like was that you get charged a lot on all services - food luggage blanket seat and so on and the price level is very high. What I didn't like was that if you didn't pre-ordered food then you have to wait to order food/drinks until after all the pre-ordered had got their service. The selection of food was either chips or a sandwich and to very steep prices - I took a cheese sandwich (no other option) and a 25cl red wine total cost 19 USD. The temperature in the airplane was roughly 18C/64F at least below what I am used to. I suspect that the Dreamliner plane has an advanced indoor climate where the temperature could be set electronically to a certain number so why didn't they set this from the start? If this was deliberately to make us buy blankets I don't know! Overall I don't like long overseas flights where you have to purchase food and drinks. A tip - buy food from the departure location (non airport) and save money.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,2,,False,
Norwegian customer review,9,2014-08-08,"Flew OAK-Oslo on July 2nd. Had bought my ticket months earlier and was very excited to fly on the ""Dreamliner"". Reviews on this site as well as others left me a bit worried so I was greatly relieved to see the Dreamliner roll into the gate at Oakland ""International"" Airport right on time. Check in was simple quick and pleasant. Plane left on time. Flight crew professional and pleasant. The plane itself being new is great although not greatly different than a 777 or Airbus. I will say the improved cabin ventilation system seemed to make quite a difference upon arrival. Did not order food but flight attendant comped me a beer and nuts after giving up my seat to a woman with two young kids. Arrived on time and did not have to worry about missing my connecting flights out of Oslo on another airline. Biggest drawback was the $36 half sandwich & beer I had at Oslo Airport.

Norwegian customer review,2,2014-08-08,"The flight from LAX to London on Norwegian Air's Dreamliner was superb. The crew were friendly and polite. The seats were comfortable. The entertainment system worked perfectly. The upgraded ""nice and tasty"" meal was quite good. A wonderful experience! Then came the return flight from Copenhagen to LAX. We waited 6 hours in the airport and 1 hour on the plane before takeoff with no explanations. The Customer Service offered a $10 meal voucher but they were almost offensive in their behavior. Thinking we would be returning on the same airline that we flew to Europe on was an assumption we should not have made. To our dismay the Dreamliner was MIA and instead we ended up on EuroAtlantic. As if that wasn't enough of a stunner the entertainment system was a total joke no WiFi our paid for ""nice and tasty"" upgraded meal never manifested and when we inquired about it the flight attendant got irritated acting as though we were out of line to even ask. Never would I fly Norwegian Air again without an absolute guarantee that it would be the Dreamliner both ways which will never happen.

Norwegian customer review,9,2014-08-08,I flew DY7015 to New York from London Gatwick on July 15th and returned on DY7016 on 2nd August. Having booked flights last October due to very cheap fares and being able to flying on the 787 I was not disappointed. I had read about the use of rented aircraft when things go wrong with their 787s but I flew on the 787 on both flights without any technical delays. Both flights left just a bit behind schedule but that was due to late passengers and the shear amount of aircraft movements at each airport. The first thing I noticed once stepping on board was the clean and fresh new smell (I flew on their newest 787 which was less than a month old) and the crew were very welcoming and helpful much more so than BA long haul. My IFE stopped working within the first 20 minutes on the outbound flight and I had to share my mum and sister's and the cabin crew didn't reset it despite being asked to twice so that was my only disappointment. It worked fine on the return flight. The pre-ordered meal going out was actually quite nice but on the inbound flight was not the best but economy airline food often isn't the best regardless of airline. The crew were attentive and friendly on both flights engaging with the customers well and always did their best to help which was great giving Norwegian are a low-cost airline. Well what can I say about the 787 it really is a pleasure to fly on! The electronically dimmable windows were cool and the size of the windows is quite large compared to similar size planes. It is a quiet plane even on takeoff so during cruise you aren't kept wide awake by the bellowing roar of the engines. I found the seats to be comfortable with great leg room (so much more compared to the likes of BA) and the mood lighting that changes colour gave a fresh feel to the flight. As an aspiring airline pilot/aviation enthusiast as well as a passenger all in all I loved my experience flying with Norwegian long haul on their 787! For a low cost airline the service is good friendly crew the pilots on the return flight were welcoming and kept us informed when possible about updates etc and there were none of the notorious extraordinary delays that seem to affect a fair few of their long haul flights. I really hope their long haul expansion works out for them as they look set to receive 9 more 787s next year in addition to the 7 they already have and that the technical issues that sometimes affect their 787s iron out. I would not hesitate to fly with them again giving the great fares. My parents are flying with them Gatwick-Barcelona in October and are eagerly anticipating their modern sky interior 737-800.

Norwegian customer review,1,2014-08-06,Aug 1st. Flight DY7087 from Arlanda to Los Angeles. Almost 8 hours delay. Scheduled departure time was 1400 and actual departure was 2145. We had driven 3 hours to Arlanda airport to check-in at 11am to be told that due to technical reasons the flight was delayed 2 hours until 1610. This then became 1840 and subsequently 2040. The announcements were made on the departure notice board. There was not one Norwegian Air employee to speak to at the airport. Given a 100 kroner meal voucher which barely covered the cost of a sandwich. The whole experience was a nightmare and we eventually got to LAX at midnight instead of 1615. The cabin staff were very polite and apologetic telling me that Norwegian Air long haul flights have a lot of problems and are very often delayed. I checked out the historical data for flights from Arlanda to Los Angeles and found that there were delays on 5 out of 6 flights the previous week with average delays of over 3 hours and in some instances cancellations.

Norwegian customer review,,2014-08-06,"Avoid Norwegian is my honest opinion and let me explain so many reasons why: Last week I accompanied my niece from LAX to LGW on Norwegian's advertised ""dreamliner"" aircraft. It turned into a 3 day delay and since we live hours away my niece had to sleep in the airport as no hotel rooms were offered. We were given limited info from the ""handling agents"" at LAX for Norwegian since apparently there is no actual Norwegian staff at any airport. I tried to call customer service. After excruciatingly long wait times we got a very unfriendly person who sounded like they did not want to be there. I read other reviews where Norwegian farms out the Dreamliner sometimes to a ""leasing"" company and much older aircraft well I did not believe it until my niece got a text message that her return flight would be on such an aircraft. It is nothing like the Dreamliner they proudly advertise. Well my mother always said if you want cheap then you will get cheap. Now I see it firsthand.

Norwegian customer review,,2014-08-06,We missed our connecting flight from Paris to Copenhagen. We contacted Norwegian Airlines at ORLY airport who informed us the flight would not be refunded or changed-the flight would still stand as is. So after spending 1000 euros to get trains to Copenhagen to catch our flight it was then delayed 5 hours and they switched us to an EuroAtlantic Boeing 777-200 from 1998 instead of the Dreamliner we had paid for! The plane was dirty with food debris and trash all over and under seats. Very apparent it had not been cleaned at all. Seat arms were broken the light switch above the seat broke apart when turned on. Also the TVs did not work. On some TVs there was no audio. No entertainment package games or wi-if that we had paid for and been promised. Also the crew seemed lost and confused obviously operating on a plane they were not familiar with. No complimentary drinks for 7 hours in between the 2 meals provided. The stewards were never around never collected trash. I had to seek them out in the back of the plane where they were standing leaning over earplugs in playing on their iPhones oblivious and disengaged from passengers and their needs. After reading all the previous comments it appears Norwegian maybe doing a bait and switch promising paid Dreamliner tickets but providing defunct broken dirty old planes but collecting premium money for it.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,
Norwegian customer review,,2014-08-06,Norwegian did it to us also. Our flight was DY7091 Copenhagen to LAX aboard the Dreamliner on August 2nd. We also never received a text or phone call about the delay. Upon arriving at the airport and checking in we were given vouchers to eat to make up for the 5 hour delay. No one ever told us about the plane change. We proceeded to board a Euro Atlantic plane which we just assumed was maybe a sister company (Not the case). Our flight was the most miserable flight. This plane was old dirty and even had ashtrays. We sat in seats that had white stuff sprayed all over from the previous flight and cups on the floor. One of the sinks in a bathroom was broken and another bathroom was completely out of service. The inflight entertainment or TV's did not work for most of the seats. The ones that did work had grainy and rolling pictures or no audio. My arm rest was broken and kept pinching me. You could not get a pillow or blanket. The overhead lights and remotes were hit and miss if they worked. This plane had no wifi staff that were clueless missing and just plain lazy. They did provide 2 meals with a drink. The food was ok no drinks were offered between the meals that were served 1 hour 30 mins after take off and before landing. My kids were bored and had no entertainment but me for 11 hours as their DS died while being used in the airport during the delay. This was a horrible flight for an adult but worse for a family with kids. Warning it looks like this is a common practice for Norwegian if you can get your money back try to or take a different flight completely. This is an unacceptable chartered plane Norwegian has leased to deal with the Dreamliner problem and they have been doing this to passengers for months.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,
Norwegian customer review,9,2014-08-06,New York (JFK) to Copenhagen (round-trip) July 2014. This route (JFK-CPH) is contracted out to EuroAtlantic Airways and uses a Boeing 777 with a friendly and efficient Portuguese crew. The airplane has leather seats older headrest entertainment screens (including a navigation channel) bring your own earbuds blanket/sweater pillow and hand sanitizer. The price you pay includes a 22 pound carry-on bag any checked baggage has an extra charge. JFK-CPH - Norwegian Air uses the generic check-in counter and generic agents at the far-end (southern side) of Terminal 1 at JFK. You only need your passport to check-in. The agents didn't seem too concerned with weight limits. The plane loaded from rear to front at the gate. No pillows blankets or earbuds. Everyone got a free dinner (tasty) and a skimpy pour of free wine. Everyone got a free box breakfast also. Many drinks were offered during the flight. Since they didn't give out blankets the plane was kept uncomfortably warm. Overhead storage filled quickly. CPH-JFK - Norwegian uses it's own employees at the Copenhagen check-in counter. Only a passport was needed to receive a boarding pass. Checked baggage was weighed. Carry-on bags were never weighed. Only two generic employees at the gate: one allowed entry to a secured seating area at the gate after checking passports and boarding passes; the second allowed everyone to board at once and collected boarding passes. Boarding went smoother than the rear-first boarding at JFK. Everyone got a free dinner (tasty) and a free large pour of wine and a free box breakfast. Many drinks were offered during the flight. No blankets pillows or earbuds. The plane was kept at a comfortable temperature. Lots of room in overhead storage. I purchased the Norwegian package that included a reserved seat a meal and one checked bag (44 pounds/ 20 kilos). If you arrive three hours prior to the flight you'll be the first to choose from the unreserved seats since everyone got free meals there was no need to pay for it and a checked bag can be purchased separately.

When I went to the bathroom to wet the napkin I noticed the bathroom had not been cleaned from the prior flight. Once the flight started we were told that the entertainment system on the plane did not work. It did not work the entire flight even though the crew stated that they reset it numerous times.

I bought a box of chips which cost me $3.00 for a tiny little bag. Flight home to Oakland was where it really broke down. Arrived at the Stockholm airport (ARN) 4 hours ahead of my departure time of 16.30. I was notified at check in that the flight was delayed two hours. Sat at the airport waiting. They then added more delay time and presented everyone with meal vouchers. 100 Swedish Kroner. Sounds like a lot until you go to buy something. Finally after checking the website for Norwegian I noticed they still hadn't changed the status of the flight and showed it leaving on time. I walked over to the counter where I learned that the flight was cancelled. No notice no announcement. Nothing. So I do as instructed by the women in charge and collect my luggage and find the counter where they are giving out vouchers for hotels. They inform me that the flight will be delayed until 18.30 the following day! No other flights are available as it is too late. I collect another 150 Kroner voucher (almost enough for 2 beers). I go to sleep and wake up to find out the flight is delayed again. The new time is now 20.30. So the bottom line is this. Norwegian knew the flight would be cancelled as the plane was still sitting in Los Angeles at the time I originally checked in. It didn't even leave LA until 2.00 the next morning! If they had told me then that the flight was cancelled I could have had a better chance of getting another flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,,,False,
Norwegian customer review,10,2014-07-27,Just a follow up to the review on my Fort Lauderdale to Gatwick flight on July 7th. I returned on July 21st and had the same pleasant experience.

Norwegian customer review,,2014-07-13,This is by the far the worst airline I have flown with. We were flying from Gatwick to Gran Canaria on the 4th of July 2014. We were meant to fly at 8.35am but the flight was delayed 2 hours which was fine. At 10.30 we went to the gate only to be told the flight was again delayed with no explanation to why just to wait for more information which was coming at 12.30. 12.30 became 12.50 and still no further forward on to what was going on. Finally at 1.30ish we got news that the flight was delayed as the plane was broken and they had to wait for another plane to take us to Las Palmas. They were hoping to get us boarded by 3pm. Got the call to go to the gate at 3 when we got on the plane we sat on the runway for 2 hours cause they had to wait for fuel. The staff were nice enough on the plane but by that point everyone on the flight was annoyed and irate after being delayed for 9 hours. It was meant to be the Dreamliner but of course it wasn't. Coming back we were delayed by 20 mins which was fine considering what we had entitled on the way there. If you get the Dreamliner it's a really nice plane with comfy seats and plenty leg room but I for one will never be flying with this company again.

Norwegian customer review,1,2014-07-13,My friend and I flew Norwegian to Europe. The plane was dirty. The staff hardly ever showed their faces. The entertainment TV did not work and the wifi they offered did not even exist. The food was interesting. Our flight back from Europe was even worse. People gathered and sat in the middle of the plane to charge phones laptops iPads etc. The staff left all the drinks out on the counter for everyone to help themselves. Bad thing with that is they also leave out the alcohol for everyone to help themselves to free beer and wine. There were many men standing around getting drunk. Free alcohol is fine when it's served in moderation especially on a plane. This is a disaster waiting to happen.

I think the dreamliner was a good travel experience flying from Fort Lauderdale to Copenhagen despite a 1 hour delay in take off. The return from Copenhagen to Fort Lauderdale with a 787 was less of a pleasant experience however the worst was arriving at Fort Lauderdale airport. Horrendous in many ways confusing and tiny passport hall even worse was the baggage hall no information total confusion and a line to customs that wrapped around the baggage hall twice yes twice!

Norwegian customer review,10,2014-07-13,I travel regularly ALC-LGW and the only bad experience was my last flight which was delayed due to the French Air Traffic Control strike which was no fault of the airline. Since I 'discovered' this low cost route I always try to book with them. I particularly like the free wifi on board and the easy check in at Gatwick as no queues to check baggage in. The only drawbacks are that you can only check in online 24 hours prior to departure and that they do not fly as regularly from/to Alicante as they do from/to Malaga. Would like to see direct flights from Manchester too! Maybe that is pushing it a bit! No problems with the flight attendants they have always been helpful and polite.

Norwegian customer review,1,2014-07-13,Just flew from Tenerife South to Hamburg Germany. Flight no. DY5366. The boarding was everyone at once instead of in sections. There was plenty of waiting time. The staff were unfriendly and hardly communicated with anyone. They didn't even bother to welcome us onboard! One had to pay for food and beverages. Just odd that flying to Tenerife from Hamburg a week earlier with Air Berlin food and beverages were provided without extra costs. I did have to pay for a warm lunch onboard Air Berlin but everything else they provided we were not charged extra for. However on this flight they came twice with their food and beverages wagon and before we could enjoy the paid beverage they were asking us to return the empty cans and plastic glasses. Rushed and silly. The seats as you would expect on a low budget airline. Nothing fancy about the new fleet. The toilet was a total mess by the third hour into the flight.

Norwegian customer review,10,2014-07-10,I flew on July 7th from Ft Lauderdale to Gatwick. Flight was on time no one at the airport at 9.30 pm so security was a breeze. Very efficient boarding was in a premium seat which was comparable to other airlines business class. Lots of room nice quiet flight and I did notice much less drying of nasal passages which normally affects me. The Dreamliner is a vast improvement on lighting etc. The food service which was included in premium was actually quite good. Good movie selection really there was nothing to moan about.

Can honestly say have never been more impressed with any airline - Norwegian delivered 5 * service with free wifi and comfortable seats. This was my first experience with them and will no doubt be my last. At Gatwick we boarded as soon as the gate was called which meant we left 30 mins early! Coming home we left 20 mins early due to low load. I must say Norwegian are one of the best for delivering quick and quality service.

On the outbound flight there was no sound for movies at her seat or the seats next to hers and on the way back no entertainment system at all.

I can't really say how bad 'Norwegian Air' was as we never flew them except for the leg from Copenhagen to Nice. Instead of the Dreamliner we ended up on a Portuguese charter 777 run by Euro Atlantic Airways. We got nothing the antiquated system on this plane didn't work. When was the last time you had an ashtray in your armrest? The food was inedible - even for airline food. The crew were on the verge of hostile and the seats were worn and uncomfortable.

Two meals included was average I bought snacks later since I was still hungry. Only one wine or beer beverage included (except for small cognac with coffee) otherwise alcoholic drinks are extra for remainder of flight.

Baggage self check-in was not available for passengers traveling to the U.S but this was not clearly displayed so I wasted 30 minutes waiting in line for self-check only to have to stand in the much longer line with ground crew afterwards. Dreamliner Boeing 787 is a comfortable quiet and well-designed aircraft and hopefully they can master the technical issues that seem to come up more often than on other Boeing aircraft. Friendly Thai crew food was good but only one wine or beer beverage (except for small cognac with coffee) any cocktails and snacks after were extra (had some issues with sliding the credit card for payment).

Norwegian customer review,,2014-06-25,"So many problems with this airline pretending to have a long-haul service. They are constantly using older ""leased"" aircraft even though they advertised the Boeing Dreamliner experience. When they do actually use the Dreamliner any minor technical issue creates massive delays over several hours and a domino effect for days. Example flt 7002 on 19 Jun delayed until past midnight due to late incoming aircraft! This happens every 2 weeks it seems as I am a busy traveller to Europe. The website constantly has credit card problems even though on other airline sites my card works fine. Last but not least a very confusing baggage policy. Most airlines to Europe offer at least 1 checked bag but Norwegian's ""lower"" fares do not make up for all these extra fees and complications.

Why would Norwegian Airlines throw away their great reputation (we've flown with them dozens of times and always enjoyed the experience) by the appalling service to NY from Copenhagen. I didn't notice that the flight was not operated by Norwegian but instead by a cheap charter company based in Portugal. I wonder how many people look at this sort of detail when they are booking a flight on an airline company website. Unless it is pointed out clearly you assume if you are booking on Norwegian you will be flying to NY on a Dreamliner operated by Norwegian with all their promises of clean aircraft tasty food free WiFi etc. None of this is the case.

All the above can be somewhat expected with a low cost charter airline however what was must alarming was their flight attendants. On such a long flight they only appeared in economy about every four hours. Of course they were present for the pre-flight speech and then reappeared about an hour later to ""toss"" box lunches to each passenger then quickly pick up the trays (I say quickly because the majority of passengers took one bite and knew instinctively to not eat the meal). After that we did not see another FA for four hours. There was no drink service but we saw many passengers going to the empty galley and figuring out how to open the cabinets searching for water bottles and soda. There were children running and playing tag in the aisles and around the lavatories. Our flight two weeks earlier on a Norwegian 787 from FLL-CPH was wonderful. Great service free wine in economy (we did pay for the seat/luggage/meal package) and a nice IFE system.

The flight back was delayed 6 hrs and 49 mins due to a technical problem with the plane which meant that we waited at Arlanda airport until 4am for a flight that was supposed to leave around 9pm.

Departure on time really nice crew at Gatwick and onboard. The aircraft was just months old and fitted with the new Sky Interior which does add a sense of spaciousness to the cabin.

Checking in at Gatwick was a case of a bag and drop using new scanning technology. A number of helpful uniformed staff were at hand to help those not used to the technology. I shall add that the boarding process was well managed and some very nice cabin crew assisted an elderly couple and a young dad with a baby.

After booking tickets on the Dreamliner aircraft which they promote we ended up on an old airbus which was dreadful to say the least. Norwegian held this fact back about the aircraft until the last minute. It was overbooked which caused a huge problem. They tried to offer an inducement of 200 euros which not many people went for. Therefore people we made to take a flight the next day. These people had bags already checked in and these had to be taken off the flight before we took off. This took time and in the process a panel door on the a/c was damaged. Overall it was over 2 hours before we took off. In this time we were sat on the plane without even being offered water. During the flight which was operated by hifly crew who seemed out of their depth. There was an old entertainment system but no headsets. The WI Fi was non existent. Therefore we watched and did nothing for 8 hours. The food which I pre-bought never came and we had no choice of what was eventually given. My seat was broken.

Even thought the service was horrible the aircraft was very clean and new and had reduced jetlag because of the air of the aircraft. Even though the snacks were really good the food that you can order in advance (which my partner ordered) was very disgusting affecting the score for food to 3 stars (out of 5). Also the IFE system was really nice since it had a cool 3D map and a lot of fun games.

Norwegian customer review,4,2014-03-26,Have flown with Norwergian regularly for 5 years. Cabin is good and clean. Free WiFi. On time. Good prices. Ground crew contractors used outside of Norwegian bases Scandinavia generally lets the whole experience down. Due to traffic I arrived at Amsterdam Schiphol airport check-in desk 35 minutes before departure with only carry-on luggage. The flight had not started boarding yet the line at security (which was adjacent to and could be seen from the check-in desk) only had two people in it. The gate was immediately after security i.e. not a long walk. Despite all this the representative at the check-in desk (from Menzies aviation) refused to print me a boarding pass bluntly stating that I should have been at the check-in desk 45 minutes before departure time. I wasn't even given the chance to catch the flight which I had paid for. Very poor customer service.

I understand how one can have a pleasant experience on the Dreamliner but that's not a credit to Norwegian that's a credit to Boeing. Unfortunately that is not always the case and since they are new planes they've had more than a few problems which one could consider as an opportunity for Norwegian to show some grace. They're not allied with any other airline so really hope they're on time and you don't have connecting flights with other airlines. They won't offer you any help. Their customer service is the worst if your flight is delayed or cancelled. You get the same smiling people who pretend to sympathize with you but that's it. Don't expect any compensation or help. My flight was delayed almost 3 days. I missed my connecting flight with another airline as a result. At the departure airport JFK in NYC they told me that they would put me on the next available Norwegian flight to my destination when I arrived in Oslo. When I got to Oslo they said I would have to buy another ticket because I was then traveling with another airline. This is despite the fact they were the reason I missed my flight.

Norwegian customer review,,2014-02-10,I have held up on writing a review to allow Norwegian the opportunity to get the growing pains out of the way. I expect less quality and comfort since it's a discount airline but Boeing Dreamliner is more like a nightmare than a dream. Four separate trips in six month (8 total legs 8 delays). Premium business is a joke. Only advantage is larger seat. Check-in with Norwegian nationals is unpleasant due to their rude nature. The staff are uninformed and do not care to inform re delays.

Perfect airplane with really high comfort and I was just as rested as would normally be flying business. Check-in in Copenhagen was smooth and pleasant even without my normal privileges as a K1 member of United. But here the good part of the story ends. The advertising says free wi-fi onboard but the only thing I got was some ""no sir sorry sir"" from a crew who barely spoke English and were constantly talking between each other. The food was pretty bland and I had to ask for my pre-paid food several times before I got it - I did wait another 45 min than my son - not so nice. Barely any water during the flight which should be complementary on any long haul flights but not here.

No ifs or buts you had to put it in the hold even though not locked or labelled try to explain this was not acceptable as did most of the other passengers but got met with you have no choice take it or leave it. As it took so long taking every bodies hand luggage from them we were delayed even further. To add insult to injury they allowed the late passengers on with any size bag.

Supposed to leave at 2.20pm but instead they set it at 7pm which they altered to 8pm and again to 9pm. They decided to board passengers only to realize we would sit in that plane for 1.5 hrs more. During the entire delay they compensated passengers with 10€ coupon? It was barely enough for a drink and a sandwich. We finally take off but to my surprise I find out that you have to buy the headphones and even the blanket on this 11 hour flight. I found it quite shocking that there was no meals on this long trip. I would have to buy it from a Snack Shop on the passenger seat monitor but I would not be able to do so until everyone else has eaten that pre-ordered hot meals.

Flight only 80 mins and left on time. Cabin Crew service fine and I paid an extra 6 pounds each way for 1st row seat which was worth it. Had the breakfast pack for inflight service for what amounted to AUS$13 and though it was reasonable value. Return flight through immigration security at CPH and left pretty much on time at 7pm the same day. Wanted to buy a sandwich and a beer for 108 kroner and wanted to pay with cash (I had the exact change) but alas they only take credit card.

So it was slow and it seemed like your co-flyers hadn't ever seen an airplane before since they just couldn't do anything fast or smart.

The journey out was on a 737-800 which had been retro fitted with the new Dreamliner interior it was smart and modern looking. We departed on time and was kept well informed during the flight from the flight deck. On the return journey the plane had a pre-retro fit and so looked more worn. Again the flight deck kept us well informed. The return was quite bumpy due to turbulence. The cabin crew were friendly both ways and I could hear them reassuring people on the return leg that were nervous of the turbulence. The prices onboard are in my view higher than other airlines but for the price you pay to travel with them I suppose they have to make the money back other ways. I am due to fly with them again in September from LGW-JFK and on the whole I'm looking forward to travelling with them again.

I spent about $70 in extras (food mostly) and still spent less on the flight but the experience left me feeling ""nickel and dimed"". The aircraft was a 787 Dreamliner and I thought the seats were more comfortable than most. The entertainment system was solid but had a poor selection compared to the United flight I took on my way to Europe with about 3X the selection. The big windows made it possible to see out from the middle section of seats. The staff did not seem to be well trained and the lighting and sound systems changed abruptly.",False,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,False,
Norwegian customer review,10,2013-12-16,This was our first experience with Norwegian Air we cannot fault them in any way. We arrived late at Edinburgh Airport for our flight to Copenhagen we were accepted for Check In we were so grateful as we only had a weekend break booked. The plane looked quite new very clean plenty of leg room the Cabin Crew were very nice. Would not hesitate to use them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Norwegian customer review,10,2013-12-10,From Alicante to Bergen on Dec 7th-13. As always: an attentive crew relaxed and efficient and with a touch of humour. Also good and reassuring information from cockpit about turbulence delays and the like. Tidy cabin and toilets leg-room ok. Web page and ticket reservations excellent. On-board WiFi very good. It's obvious that the airline over the years has put much emphasis on building a robust passenger-friendly culture. Given the recent press coverage about salary-cuts and increase of working-hours I think it's impressive that the crews keep up the good work as always. From long flyer-experience with Norwegian I've never noticed any negative fluctuations of the service-level.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,True,
Norwegian customer review,4,2013-12-06,Flew Malaga to Munich Monday 2nd December. Could not print out boarding pass so stood with all the hold luggage folks at check-in. On the plane the staff hid behind a curtain and told my wife off for waiting for the toilet inside the curtain. Drinks came round eventually but not offered a second one on a 3 hour flight. Today 6th December arrived early at Munich to catch flight to be told it's delayed from 9pm until the following day at 6.30. As I write this am not yet on the flight so we will see. However the compensation for 9 hours at the airport was just food and not other help offered. Claimed adverse weather was to blame but at the check in desk this evening the Oslo flight was boarding so they have abandoned a non hub flight to support a flight but to Norway. Norwegian claimed via their handling agent that everyone got an SMS which was clearly untrue as others we spoke to had not got any update for a travel delay.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,2,,False,
Norwegian customer review,8,2013-11-29,"Bergen to Alicante. The flights with Norwegian are always the same I mean: the overall ok quality of the product is very stable. The cabin crew are very relaxed efficient and friendly. Norwegian is very serious about safety regulations in the cabin and the crew enforces the rules in a friendly and helpful manner. While the ""nordic"" idea about service may lose out against an Asia-based airline the advantage shows aboard a low-cost airline like Norwegian. You may have to wait a few minutes until the crew's free to serve your coffee you may have to stand in line a few minutes for the toilet to be vacant but the crew really work to make the best of it and you notice!",False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,5,,True,
Norwegian customer review,10,2013-11-18,CPH-LGW-CPH in B737-800. Clean cabin and pleasant crew outbound as well as homebound wifi functioning above flight level 300 as announced. Food & beverage still on the expensive side however that's up to the individual. So far my three round trip flights on DY have been smooth.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,5,,True,
Norwegian customer review,10,2013-11-11,My first trip with Norwegian today and impressed. Low cost ticket but beats the other two major low cost operators hands down. Aircraft presentation first class Crew all wearing a professional looking uniform and provided excellent service a credit to the airline. Wi-fi availability on board the flight made such a difference. I will certainly be looking to see if they fly routes to any future destination I may choose if so will certainly book Norwegian.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Norwegian customer review,8,2013-11-11,OSL-BGO. Punctual - arrived a little earlier than scheduled time. Aircraft (737-800) brand new. Free WiFi. Seats OK but not too much legroom. No drinks or snacks (it's only a 45 min flight) available - nor for purchase. Staff friendly. Only one seating class (all economy). Ticket fares very reasonable compared to other airlines.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Norwegian customer review,10,2013-11-04,Gatwick to Lanzarote. My wife and I had a great flight no problems at check in no problem boarding.

Norwegian customer review,8,2013-11-01,Alicante to Gatwick 31st October 2013. 21.15 departure. No Online Check-in which meant long queues at the airport for passengers with hand luggage only to get their boarding passes from the desks (no explanation as to why online check in was not available). However there were 4 desks open for just 1 flight which meant the queue moved quickly. Boarding process chaotic with people unsure which rows were boarding (unclear announcement poor organisation by gate staff) so only a trickle of passengers boarded for quite a while meaning the whole process took twice as long as it needed to. Other carriers have much more efficient and streamlined boarding procedures which Norwegian needs to learn from. Last 30 passengers to board had their hand luggage put in the hold because there was no more space in the cabin (no-one checked size of number of pieces of carry ons). Onboard seat pitch good seat comfort acceptable for a short flight. IFE shown on screens (cartoons etc). Free wifi available but extremely slow. Cabin crew very friendly. No pushy selling (in fact no announcements were made after takeoff until just before landing). Lights dimmed for people to be able to rest. On-time arrival. Norwegian on the ground are somewhat amateurs however onboard experience was very good. I would use them again but they need to improve their ground experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True,
