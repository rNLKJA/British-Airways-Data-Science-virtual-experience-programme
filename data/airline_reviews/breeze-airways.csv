Five days before my trip they canceled my flight out of nowhere with no explanation. The only offered choices for resolution were to rebook the flight within fourteen days of the original departure date or get a refund of $160 for the canceled roundtrip flight. There were three snags with this: firstly, I needed the specific dates scheduled as I had booked over $1,200 worth of stays and activities at my destination which were non-movable (due to it being a holiday weekend) and non-refundable. Secondly, no other flights to and from my destination were even available within the allotted fourteen day window, so even if I hypothetically wished to take advantage of that resolution path it would have been entirely moot. Thirdly, because they waited until five days before the flight to cancel it, I had to pay $400 to rebook with a different airline, far more than my initial $160. When I went to their customer support page to get help with the myriad issues they created, I found out there is no way to call them for assistance. Instead, you must text message them. I text messaged them within five minutes of being notified my flight was canceled. The automated response said it would take ""several hours"" for a response. It took more than a day and half. When they did respond, they offered less than zero help. They offered the same two options given online with zero empathy, explanation or apology for their actions. They basically said ""screw you, we don't care."" They did not care about the extra expenses I incurred, would not assist even one iota with those expenses when asked, and did not seem to care that they had created a nightmare scenario through their own ineptitude. Because I had one more trip booked with them for later this year and I no longer trust them to honor their agreements, I requested a refund for that trip. Their bot-like agent offered me ""breeze points"" in lieu of a refund. Despite multiple appeals to empathy, common sense, and functionally begging for any leniency, decency or kindness, they merely stated ""this is our final business decision."" Their customer support is non-existent. They are happy to take your money, but will not honor their commitments to their customers; worse, when asked for accommodation and assistance due to their ineptitude, they refuse to issue even the mildest of apologies, proffer any explanation for their despicable behavior. Thank goodness I booked these trips on my Amex Platinum, so getting the refund through them was much easier.

"""hands down the worst""",1,2022-06-27,"Not Verified |  First, they cancel our flight after 2 delays. Which aside from the loss of an entire day and schedule disruption, wouldn't be terrible, but their employees at the counter abandoned it, leaving only a sign saying to use their app for support.. Our bags were nowhere to be found, support wouldn't answer, they were not at the baggage claim. We lost several more hours just trying to find our bags we dropped off hours earlier when checking in. After rescheduling, I completed my journey.. but the pilot we had on the return flight was obviously new, they didn't do any snack or beverage service, citing ""bad weather"" as we flew between two calm, sunny destinations with no turbulence. It was quite obvious at takeoff and landing, I've never been on a flight that shook so much in clear weather. Now I'm sitting on the tarmac here, we arrived ""on time"" 25 minutes ago but for some reason we don't have a gate to deboard?

"""This airline is a complete scam""",1,2022-06-25,"Not Verified |  Never got to fly with them because they cancelled my flights twice. The first time they cancelled the return flight for my whole family and I had to extend my trip to take their next available flight which takes a lot of additional booking and planning (lodging, transportation, etc.), then one week before our trip they cancelled all flights. So after working around their initial failure, they cancelled our entire trip ONE WEEK BEFORE. At this point trying to rebook with another airline is far too expensive being so close to the date and during a holiday which is why we booked our trip early in the first place! Now we have to go through cancelling every booking and plan we had and having to pay cancellation fees for everything because Breeze Airways absolutely screwed us. This is too far. I don't know how they are in business. After seeing every review on their social media page, it looks like every single person has had their flights cancelled by Breeze and even worse, the day of. This airline is a complete scam. Consider yourself warned! Don't believe me? Research reviews, check their social media comments...all the same thing. It's not right for them to keep doing this to people.",False,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Norfolk ,June 2022,1,1,,1,1,,False,
"""proven to be completely unreliable""",1,2022-06-25,"Tried out the airline due to nonstop flight from TPA to RIC. On 6/23, flight was delayed but we still departed and I made my business dinner on time. I was set to depart the next day on 6/24. I received a text at 1 a.m. advising the flight was cancelled and rebooked for Saturday - zero explanation or support info. I was forced to rebook my hotel and cancel pre-made plans on both Friday and Saturday as a result. I made the best of up and was ready to leave the next morning for the reset 11 a.m. flight. However, at 1 am, I again received a text message that my flight was delayed and not departing until after 3. I have now had to beg for refunds for preplanned ticked and events in TPA that I no longer can attend due to these delays. I tried to get in touch with Support to just get answers and options, and I was met with an automatic text response that they are very busy and a response would not be given until several hours later. I was willing to try and recommend this airline to others. The planes themselves are quite nice, but they have proven to be completely unreliable.

"""Recommend avoiding""",1,2022-06-25,"This airline may be a fine choice when they sort out their problems, but I didn't have the opportunity to actually fly with them. I was excited to find a much better fare than any major airline flying SFO to RIC for a business conference, and nonstop as well. However two days before the flight I received a one sentence text message saying the flight was cancelled. This is the first thing to sort out--send the apologetic email with links for getting a refund first, not the curt text message! I was not pleased to see that. The next available flight on Breeze was one week later (maybe... if they don't cancel it). In the end my full fare was refunded, but the new flight on United cost about 80% more than the Breeze fare ($250 more). I was given a $50 credit in ""Breeze Points,"" but when I asked they refused to refund that to me as cash as a goodwill gesture. And, I'm in Richmond waiting to go home, and I see that both Breeze's flights to Tampa and SFO have been cancelled today.

Then they cancel flight home at 0100 day before flight. They expect me to pay extra 2 days Hotel stay. Next flight was Monday. Canceled flight was Saturday.

"""just not ready for flight""",1,2022-06-23,"Not Verified |  This airline is just not ready for flight. They cancel and delay flights with little notice and no assistance. They really do not have customer service available in any meaningful way or channel. They took away our purchased first class (nicest class) seats with little more than an e-mail. Most unsettling is their crew admit to being unfamiliar with their aircraft. When asked about the equipment we got a shrug and “it is new so we don’t know”.

"""recommend avoiding Breeze Airways""",1,2022-06-18,"Just had the worst customer service experience of my life with Breeze Airways. Two days before my flight was scheduled to depart, they emailed me with a notification that my flight had been cancelled. No opportunity for recourse, no phone number on their website, and no response for almost 24 hours to the emails, sms messages, and messenger app messages I sent. Even worse, if and when they do finally respond to you, it turns out that they won't even help you rebook a comparable flight. It's basically, ""Sorry, you're out of luck."" This is absolutely unacceptable. I built my vacation around the availability of this flight. As a result of their mistakes, I had to book a far worse flight at a far greater cost that will not get me to my destination in time to work the next day, which means that I am also losing income. Overall, their mistakes are costing me hundreds of dollars and a lot of wasted time and energy, and they offer no real compensation or even sincere apologies for what they have done. I know budget flights are tempting, but given my experience here I would highly recommend avoiding Breeze Airways. They are worse than all others.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Richmond,June 2022,,,,,1,,False,
