"""the flight itself was unbearable""",1,2021-01-06,"Not Verified |  I had a business trip from Hamburg to Stockholm, I hated this flight. The cabin crew were quite nice but the flight itself was unbearable! The seats were very dirty and the floor was very sticky like someone had spilt a soda! I do not like this airline and I'm not going to fly it again! My meal was very dry, I had to drink so much with the meal to make it somewhat bearable.",False,CRJ900,Business,Economy Class,Hamburg to Stockholm,June 2020,1,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,1,False
"""legroom is more than okay""",7,2017-12-06,"Warsaw to Tallinn. Our flight was in code-share with LOT Polish Airlines. Between our arrival and departure there were 55 minutes (gate opens 30 mins before departure), the ground crew worked very well so we could catch our Nordica flight to Tallinn with ease. The seats are comfortable, the legroom is more than okay. Bigger meals and drinks are available on purchase but they serve complementary drinks (coffee, tea, water) and snacks (chocolate bar). The cabin crew was kind and the cabin was clean.",True,Bombardier CRJ-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Warsaw to Tallinn,September 2017,5,4,,5,3,,,True
"""sign of high professionalism""",10,2017-02-16,"âœ… Verified Review |  Stockholm to Tallinn with Nordica (a LOT flight). Upon boarding flight LO8122 on Feb 14 there were three drunk youngsters who had been quite loud in the terminal building and this went on in the plane. The flight attendants noted the guys, made quick analyses of their behaviour and personalities and approached them in a strict, polite but decisive way. Their approach was perfect given the situation. The guys got the message and behaved. This was a sign of high professionalism from the FAs. In addition to that the CRJ 900 was fresh and clean - Announcements were perfect.",False,CRJ 900,Business,Economy Class,Stockholm to Tallinn,February 2017,4,5,,5,5,,,True
