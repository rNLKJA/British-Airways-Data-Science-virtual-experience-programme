Horrible includes the fact that they are always delayed but if you are running behind they charge you a $100 “rebooking fee,” which is about what it cost for a ticket anyway. But they will tell you that a ticket costs $200 one way, which is nonsense. If I could find another way to my destination I would never fly them again. They price gouge and are inconsiderate.
