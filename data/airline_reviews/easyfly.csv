"""pleased we chose EasyFly""",9,2022-03-24,"Not Verified |  We flew EasyFly from Medellin EOH to Pereira. When we checked in online, we discovered they'd moved the flight 15 minutes later. This wasn't a problem for us, and we checked in online without problem. Check in at the airport was quick and we had no issues with bags - one was slightly over 15kg, one was under, and we didn't get charged. The flight was on time and upon arrival in PEI the bags were on the belt immediately. The plane was clean and seemed fairly new. It was impossible to buy a ticket from the US (with a US credit card) on their website, however we were finally able to buy a ticket online using a Colombian travel agency, Aviatur. We had no problems and were pleased we chose EasyFly.",False,ATR 72,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Medellin to Pereira,March 2022,4,3,,5,5,,True
"""overall a great experience""",8,2020-01-20,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bogota to Pereira. After reading many bad reviews, were prepared for anything. Fortunately, everything went well! Our slightly overweight baggage was not an issue (16kg+7kg), the ground staff was friendly. Not knowing if they charge extra for not printing the ticket, we did the check in ourselves (but seeing many with an airline printed ticket I assume this is not an issue). The flight left 8 minutes earlier (!), the cabin crew was friendly as well and during the short flight, they even offered us a small free drink. The plan was clean, the captain friendly. So overall a great experience. Not much to complain about, really!",True,ATR72-600,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bogota to Pereira ,January 2020,4,5,,5,5,,True
"""worst airline I ever knew.""",1,2018-05-17,"Pereira to Bogota. This is the worst airline I ever knew. I bought a plane ticket because I thought it was cheap and because my mum had an important appointment in Bogota that she could not miss. The plane was delayed for more than 1.30 hours in Pereira, which made my mum very stressed as she could miss the appointment (which had costed me much more than the plane ticket). I spoke to the airline over the phone and asked them for compensation, they told me that the passengers usually get offered compensation at the airport. They lied. My mum was only offered a sandwich lunch. When I asked the airline the amount of compensation I could get, they tried to avoid the question and did not give me any answers. In the end, they told me to fill in a form online, that who knows how long they will take to come back me with an answer. My recommendation is to pay a bit more, and not make the mistake that I just did, and buy plane ticket with Avianca, which is a much better airline.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Pereira to Bogota,May 2018,1,1,,1,1,,False
"""meal was so poor""",2,2017-12-04,"Medellin to Pereira. I flew to 49 countries around the world. My work involves some serious traveling and here I am after 7 hour delayed local flight with no apologies of EasyFly. This is the worse flight I have ever taken. First they don’t notify you of time changes, then they gave me a meal that was so poor that I couldn’t even eat it. Then they put all passengers on a bus to take us to a different airport and dropped us there without any kind of information. Unbelievable. Different airlines are taking off in our eyes while they said the flight is closed due to bad weather. Wouldn’t be flying with them any more, for sure!",True,,Business,Economy Class,Medellín to Pereira,December 2017,3,2,,2,2,,False
"""Don't take it if you are a tourist""",1,2016-07-31,✅ Verified Review |  Easyfly from Pereira to Medellin. Don't take it if you are a tourist! Booked and payed online more than a month ago and only once arrived at the check in they told me my booking was cancelled (although the money were charged on my bank account). I had to pay a higher price to fly. None at the check in or call center speaks basic English.,False,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,PEI  to EOH,July 2016,2,2,,1,1,,False
"""best opinion about this airline""",9,2016-03-27,"✅ Verified Review |  Matecaña to Enrique Olaya Herrera, Medellin with Easyfly. The flight was a little delayed, but not too much. They have a nice staff, the flight was very quiet and comfortable. They bring a little catering, but the flight just takes 30 minutes so it`s a really nice detail, the plane was clean, the price is very atractive. I have the best opinion about this airline.",False,JS-41,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,PEI to EOH,March 2016,4,5,,4,5,,True
"""helpful and professional""",8,2016-01-11,"Palonegro to Cucuta with Easyfly. Was put on this flight after Satena cancelled one of the legs. I was hesitant since I had to make it to CUC that day. The JS41 are quite small, yet efficient planes. Easyfly ground staff at Palonegro was quite helpful and professional. Flight was smooth and punctual. No complaints at all. Despite the short duration of the flight (35 minutes) refreshments were offered. Would consider it if needed.",False,JS41,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BGA to CUC,December 2015,3,4,,5,5,,False
