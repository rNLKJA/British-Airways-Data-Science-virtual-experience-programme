"""Before I even got on the plane its a disaster""",1,2022-11-07,Before I even got on the plane its a disaster. Original flight cancelled and moved to a flight two hours later. This was not suitable so had to call to get an earlier flight. Managed to get one an hour earlier. They didn't transfer my seats across so now I'm going to have to separate my two small children so good luck other passengers. Waited on hold for 25 mins to speak to someone because couldn't check in online. I started speaking and they put me on hold then came back pretending they couldn't hear my and just cut me off. Told me to wait 15 mins and the online check in would work. it didn't.

The on board staff were exceptionally pleasant, helpful and obliging. The space when seated was larger than Jetstar offers, and the leg room accordingly. And what a surprise to be offered a snack with Tea or Coffee, AND at no extra cost. My only disappointment is, that they don't fly to Darwin.
