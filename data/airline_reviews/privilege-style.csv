On the morning of our flight, TUI informed us that due to scheduling issues, they have enlisted Privilege style as a charter airline.

I had a 1 year old and 6 year old with me. The staff on board were amazing! They were friendly, great with my children and when my 1 year old was crying before take off they came to play with her distracting her. My 1 year old went to the front to play with the staff at one point of the flight. I found the seat comfort fine, it was clean and just what I expected.

"""I had an amazing experience""",10,2019-07-29,"Privilege Style operate an old Singapore Airlines 777 and I took their flight between Miami and London Gatwick as Norwegian were unable to run their new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. I see a lot of people complaining about Privilege Style however I had an amazing experience in their business class cabin. I actually chose to fly with Privilege Style so I could experience the old Singapore Airlines business class cabin and I wasn't disappointed! The business class cabin was in a 2-2-2 configuration and was completely booked out, however the seat I had was very spacious and I had so much room to myself. The cabin crew in the business cabin looked after us like a true business class experience, which I was not expecting! We had a welcome drink and there were plenty of staff for the small number of people in the cabin. I pressed the call button at one point and a cabin crew member came over straight away. The food was very good too, nothing special but it was better than I expected. It was also served quickly too which was great, there's nothing worse than waiting hours for your meal. We had blankets and a pillow provided too really making this feel like a business class flight and I liked how the cabin crew stopped economy passengers from using our toilets. As we flew over the Atlantic the cabin lights dimmed and most people got sleep. I've flown business class several times before and for the price I paid this is one where I got the most value. Note that the entertainment system is a bit rubbish, but I knew that and took my laptop pre-loaded with some films and my own noise cancelling headphones. I'm posting this because I did research before this flight online and couldn't find any positive reviews about the business class experience, and for that reason I was worried about what it was going to be like. I hope this review helps people who might be thinking about booking with Privilege Style.",True,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Miami to London Gatwick,June 2019,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",5,5,,True,
"""avoid flying with them""",1,2019-06-04,"Miami to Gatwick. We just came back from Miami to UK with this airline outsourced by Norwegian. My seat was broken and would not tilt back so all 8 hours flight I had to seat stick straight. I did report it to a staff member but they have done nothing. There is no entertainment at all so make sure you take book, or magazines. To make it worst we waited over 2 hours in to a flight for stewardess to buy any drinks. We asked 5 times and they kept saying that someone is coming. Staff members were sharing funny looks with knowing smiles when asked for something by customer. Although they were all nice and polite you could see it was not genuine. There is no wifi or USB plug to charge your phone. Would definitely advise to avoid flying with them if possible.",True,Boeing 777 200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Gatwick,June 2019,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",2,2,,False,1
"""aircraft is from 1990""",1,2019-01-02,"Rome to Newark booked as a Norwegian flight but be wary of flights like this that area operated by Privilege style. I have never been more disappointed by an overseas long haul flight. The name itself is terrible, but paying almost $650 to fly one way made me angry. This aircraft is from 1990, there is no on flight entertainment that works (2 channels did but the headphone jack didnt), there is no complimentary water, the staff on these flights are like robots. The seat pocket was falling apart and culd barely hold the magazines.

After 4 days a friend of my bought same ticket and spent 250 dollars round trip same airport.  I will keep with British Airways, American Airlines and Alitalia.

"""an antiquated aircraft""",2,2018-09-19,"Norwegian notified us that Privilege Style would be operating both legs of our EWR trip to and from Rome.  Purchased Premium seats at $900+ Each and basically had an antiquated aircraft with one or two movies that ran on a track if you’re lucky to have a tv, remote, light or seat that was operable. Both ways seats were inop or stuck. The man in front of us had the seat I had going to Rome. The overhead lights, call buttons that were broken were now causing others frustration and a very strong sense of bait and switch. I have flown business/premium On Norwegian previously without a doubt I will think twice before booking Norwegian. Crew was nice coming back, all he did was repair pax equipment.
