I know that no airline is perfect and that there are tons of things that can go wrong from a logistical standpoint, but how the company handles this is important. Swoop could not care less about customer service. There is no working phone number to speak with a CSR. Emails are unanswered. Tweets are promised a 72-hour turnaround time. The FB Messenger bot is useless. Do not fly on this airline. We were actually booked on another airline LAS - YYZ but wanted to go home earlier. Swoop had an early afternoon flight (as did AC and WestJet, but we wouldn't be able to sit together). We booked it with extras - checked & cabin baggage, priority boarding. When the agent took our bags only then were we advised that the flight was delayed several hours. Although it was about 2 hours before the flight was originally scheduled to depart Vegas, the inbound aircraft had not even yet left Toronto. The departure was ultimately put off to 5:30 pm and we were each given a $10 meal voucher for our trouble. My originally booked flight, which I had to cancel, departed on time at 5:05. (Flair). When the aircraft arrived at the gate, the boarding process began with our zone 1. We passed through boarding pass scanning, and were met with a long line of people waiting to board in the jetway. We were towards the back of the line, near the entrance to the jetway. We waited there about 15 - 20 minutes before some people in hi-vis jackets passed by us and then quickly came out to abruptly tell us the flight was cancelled. We immediately re-booked on the later, red-eye AC Rouge flight 1704 (which was excellent and on-time, by the way). We had to be in Buffalo by 11am on Saturday. That red-eye was our last chance to meet that deadline. Swoop later emailed us with a link to book an overnight room and rebooked our flight to the next morning, Saturday Nov. 12, at 10am. It ultimately left late, at 11:50 am, arriving in Toronto at 6:30 pm, about 24 hours later than originally scheduled. Do not fly this airline. Literally choose anything else- rent a car one way if necessary. Since we had only just bought our ticket that same morning, I certainly assumed that getting a refund would not be a problem. It has now been well over 72 hours with no communication whatsoever from the airline in response to our many inquiries, and no real way to reach them. You are better off walking. Although Swoop said that the delay was somehow due to customs & immigration delays (even though the passengers on the inbound flight YYZ - LAS would have all precleared US customs in Toronto), I suspect that the real issue was that the delay had taken the crew out of its allowed time for service, and they had a mandatory rest period before the flight could resume on its way back to Toronto. Why do I think so? Because I sure didn't see any new crew show up and I was at that gate literally from 11:30 am - 5:30pm. So, they'll try to avoid having to make refunds by lying about the reason for both delays - inbound to LAS and outbound from LAS.",False,Boeing 737-8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Las Vegas to Toronto,November 2022,1,1,,1,1,,False,

This time was different though, I had my one year old daughter with me. What started out as Swoop airlines telling me I was at the wrong gate - turned into over $1400+ in expenses and damages in just a few hours. As I approached gate B5 at Toronto Pearson airport which was stated on my ticket where my flight would be - the service staff informed me that I was infact flying out of B25 instead. So, from there I pretty much ran pushing my daughter in the stroller approximately 15 mins across the airport. Once I reached B25 I was informed there that the flight I was trying to catch had already left. From there, I back tracked. Racing both my daughter and I back to B5. And what happens when I reach B5? I am denied boarding. They told me they called my name so many times that I can no longer board, I've missed my chance, as I watch the plane preparing to leave the gate. Keep in mind, my reason for flying is because I am relocating from Ontario to Saskatchewan. I have no family left and not many friends in Ontario. I am flying to Edmonton to meet my family. With my one year old daughter. I begin panicking, as someone who does infact suffer from major anxiety, I'm being told I can't catch my flight. At this point I'm told to sit down and they will help me. I'm crying uncontrollably when the supervisor approaches me. Telling me infront of the rest of the people waiting for other flights to ""get it together"" and ""what example I am setting for my daughter"" So now I'm being shamed by someone who has no compassion that a young mother who has been denied access to fly to my new home is over reacting? I'm sorry but if you were told to get it together and go home with nowhere to go how would you react? At this point some stranger came over to me and tried to calm me down. I couldn't stop crying and began having a panic attack. This went on for over an hour before they told me to go home and that they can do nothing for me. Not only blaming me for missing a flight I was prepared and waiting for but shaming me, calling me names and being far from decent. There was no compassion for someone who was told to go else where and then sent back to where I was originally was just for them to tell me that it was my fault? Telling me to go home but where do I go? No car, no house, no family. Just me and my daughter at this point it was midnight and I was left alone at the gate. The only person who showed me any decency was the security guards who helped me find my way out of the airport and over to the connecting hotel. The Sheraton. How is it fair that I had to check in to a hotel at 1am with my baby and be charged $545 for a single room from the hours of 130am until check out which was 11am that same morning?

We originally booked a flight via credit card in January 2020 to travel in June 2020. After the flight got changed multiple times(different time of day and then to a completely different airport which was an hour and a half away) it was inevitably cancelled due to the pandemic. We were offered credits for the flight that would expire in 2 years which we took as that was the only option available at the time. We did not qualify for a refund as it was uncontrollable. Finally, this year we decided to book our trip again and use our credits. We booked 3 months ahead of our flight time. We were no longer able to fly out of the city we live in as Swoop was no longer offered at that airport so we booked our flight out of an airport 2 hours away. We also had to pay a little bit extra as flights were more expensive now. They changed our flight times 3 times since we booked. Same day but different times which is a little annoying but not the end of the world until today when we got the notification that our return flight had changed again, this time it was 2 full days after our original return date. For us, this is not an acceptable change as we are scheduled to leave in a week and a half. Our vacation time with work was already booked, our accommodations were booked and our car rental was booked. When this happens, they give you the option to accept the changes, make your own changes or cancel and receive a refund in the form of the original payment. I contacted them on social media asking if I could receive a full refund to my credit card and they said no. Since this flight was booked using mostly credits, I could only receive another credit to my account but I would receive the additional money I spent(since the flights for more expensive than our original booking) on my credit card. I fought with them a bit on this because I don't really want credit towards an airline I never intend to use again due to the complete uncertainty of the flights themselves but the answer was still no. They put the onus completely on the passenger to change their whole schedule around every single little change they make. They make it incredibly difficult to make your own changes but they are allowed to make several unreasonable changes.

I had nowhere else to stay, and he and my extended family all had to quarantine for ten days (my trip was 8 days). I did everything possible to cancel or change my flight.

"""had an excellent trip""",8,2021-11-05,"We are a family of 4 that took a mini-vacation from Edmonton to Victoria over Thanksgiving 2021. I was hesitant to book Swoop based on the plethora of bad reviews but the price was just too good to pass up. I had only flew with Swoop once before on a solo two-day trip to Toronto that went without a hitch. Booking: Fully-online. No trouble. Seat selection: Paid for 4 seats up-front as a kids was free to select a seat for if an adult paid for a seat. Not too shabby. Bag Charge: Paid for one checked bag up front to save costs at the Airport. Weighed in at 48 pounds. Checked bags: Did not bring checked bags due to cost. Personal items: Kids brought mini-back-backs that held small electronics, snacks, a water bottle. All within specs. No issues. I brought a laptop case that also fit snacks and water. No issue. Wife brought large purse with no issue. Just don't expect to pack clothes to avoid the check-in bag charge and you will be alright. Post-booking: Swoop up and changes out return date from Tuesday to Monday. Given that we were departing on the Saturday, this cut the by a 1/3 if accepted. I did not accept and changed the flights to arrive and depart a day earlier resulting in the same length of stay. Did this on-line with no issues and no additional fees for either the change itself or cost of the new dates as the original cost of both those dates was $150 more than the dates we originally picked. Swoop absorbed the cost on-line due to the cancellation of one of the return flight date. Issues post re-booking: The paid checked bag moved over to the new flights but the seat assignments and the fact we paid did not. No ability to select seats on-line without paying the same fee over again. Called the call center number, put the phone on the desk while I did other things on the computer and was connected after 105 minutes. The call center agent was able to book the 4 of us together at no charge based on the fact we had originally paid for the tickets. A bit of a hassle but we were getting a better itinerary dates than the one we originally purchased so I took the good with the bad. Check-in: Checked in on-line and downloaded digital boarding passes. That did not take care of still needing to check in the checked bag so we arrived 60 minutes before the check-in closed to drop off the bag. Bad check-in took 4 minutes.

Toasted by wife on what was an excellent vacation.  Despite the cancellation of the return flight date (they cancelled all Tuesday flights from Edmonton to Victoria for the next year which meant we were not a one-off) everything else went as expected. Same thing could have happened with any other airline so we did play the victim card and had an excellent trip. The only word of advice I would give is to book refundable hotels in case this type of cancellation happens. We booked our hotels using air miles so lost a night at the end.

"""showed me zero compassion""",1,2021-11-03,"Not Verified |  I've been experiencing quite possibly the worst few month of my life and Swoop agents showed me zero compassion in anyway that actually matters, adding insult to injury. I had to cancel my flight within the 24 hour window on October 5th due to illness and had to get a COVID-19 test. I was told my flight could be rescheduled. Under the impression my flight was successfully cancelled I was instructed to call back to reschedule the next day when I knew a return date. That very same day, my father had a stroke. I was actually visiting him because he had a heart attack just 2 weeks prior. Needless to say he was in the hospital and this was a scary time where I was far more preoccupied with my parents and making sure my father was going to be ok. A few days after that, I get the news that the man I love and was supposed to spend my life with passed away suddenly. I don't think further explanation is needed for just how taxing what I have been experiencing is on one's mental and physical health, let alone finances. My week long visit turned into one month and it's quite evident why calling Swoop back was not a top priority. I put a request in for an agent to contact me days ago and never heard from anyone. I called today and was on hold for around an hour. The agent I finally connected with, despite my specific circumstances around my return, was purely focused on the fact that the last agent who was supposed help me with my flight conveniently did not ""cancel"" my flight or take any notes that mention the word cancel. Meaning she could not credit me for a flight that was not cancelled and was unwilling to consider any other way of assisting me. Life happens, and being a budget airline I thought that they may understand the gravity finances have on people's lives. Due to life events entirely out of my control that I am still learning how to cope with today, I'm now out more money paying for another flight so I can return to work before I stop getting paychecks.

Leg room and seats were perfectly fine. Food was lacking but when you are paying literally less than half the price of other airlines you cant complain!

They have overnight flights which are great because you end up sleeping through most of the journey.

The attendant proceeded to tell me that she can’t do that and there is no return policy so I have to pay for the bags again. I told her I am not asking for a refund, I am asking if the bags can be switched to my departure. She said no. I asked if I can speak with someone she said she was the supervisor and it is their policy. I get that, but is there a way to adjust this so I don’t have to repay for this simple mistake. She called someone and I’m at the end of it when I was told I would still need to pay again the same price I paid online ($110).

"""denied boarding for my flight""",1,2019-10-05,"Abbotsford to Hamilton. Yesterday evening, after nine hours of travel (air and land) from Queen Charlotte BC in Haida Gwaii to Abbotsford I was denied boarding for my flight to Hamilton. The reason for denial was having incorrect identification according to company policy, but I feel that the issue was addressed with little respect and understanding of the situation and the lack of willingness to cooperatively address the issue will result in me missing my brother's wedding tomorrow. Earlier this week I lost my wallet with my passport in it, leaving me with no photo identification, living on a small island with no access to apply for an emergency passport or other government identification. From a Service BC satellite office, I acquired an interim driver's license and interim BC Services Card (Care Card). Prior to my travel, I checked the Transport Canada regulations and found that for domestic travel 2 pieces of valid (not-expired) government issued identification were acceptable so long as they had the name that matched the ticket, birth date and gender. It also mentioned in the case of a driver's license having the expired license as accompanying photo ID. I had all these pieces, although my expired driver's license was for an Ontario license rather than my interim BC license (which is just the reality of me moving from Ontario to BC within the past few years). I figured I had all the necessary documents to travel. I did a quick scan of Air Canada and Swoop policies and noted they mirrored Transport Canada policies. I was able to board my Air Canada flight from Sandspit to Vancouver with the documentation I had on hand. I then traveled 2 hours from YVR to YXX on public transit and was denied boarding for my 9:55pm flight. The reasons provided to me were as follows: - Because my expired license is from a different issuing agency than my interim license, it was not considered valid as a primary or secondary piece of ID - Swoop accepts ""Care Cards"", but the customer service representative said that ""BC Services Cards"" are not the same. BC only issues Service Cards now, so the paperwork I had was as close to a Care Card as I was going to get. The other ID I had on hand included a fishing license (accepted until very recently), several student cards (which I recognize are not government issued), photocopy of my passport, and an expired government-issued residency card. I was told that there was no grace period for accepting the fishing license, although the Transport Canada policy change is still in its grace period. When I was denied I respectfully accepted that I did not have what was required, but asked if I could switch to the flight the next day... I would have my friends send down my birth certificate and any other documentation today (Oct 4) to board the 9:55pm flight. I also asked if he could help me identify what ID I would need if I rebooked the flight. The agent said he did not have time to help with re-booking and told me to call Swoop (the offices were closed at that time). I asked if his team lead could help me, he went to ask her, but came back saying she was too busy to talk to me. This morning I called the Swoop office. The woman I spoke to was very sympathetic and said if I was able to get proper ID she could book me on this evening's flight and offered to ask her supervisor if they could give me a voucher towards the price of the flight (which had gone up to over $450 one way).",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Abbotsford to Hamilton,October 2019,,,,1,1,,False,

I thought from Winnipeg to Edmonton I would use some credit from the unused flight. It took 3 times at 45 minutes on hold each time before I got through to someone. Although I had prepaid the seat and baggage that was non-refundable - absurd since neither was use. There was a $100 cancellation fee - I couldn't use the insurance I purchased because I couldn't get through on the phone to re-book my original flight. They agree to refund me $59. A month later I still didn't have it so I went on their online chat. 6 hours I was on chat as the ""person"" would leave for an hour at a time. They said there was a credit to my Swoop account for 90 days - really? They never said that before. After understanding the full story, not being able to re-book due to their shortcomings not mine, providing them with my re-booked flight info, etc they then agreed to refund $76.70 to the original method of payment. This conversation occurred Aug 15th. To date no refund. I went back on chat and was asked all the same stuff - I think they are trained to wear a person down.

"""great for lower price flights""",5,2019-09-13,"First and foremost Swoop has the worst customer service help available. It takes them 5 hours to a few days to reach back. They do not come up with solutions, their reps are extremely robotic on the phone and they strictly stick to their policies. So avoid making any mistakes or changes, or you will run into this issue, and it's the biggest pain. On a lighter note, Swoop is great for lower price flights. You pay for your base cost flight, then you pay for your seats, baggage, and any thing extra. So you get to control what you want and how much you want to ideally pay for for a flight altogether. The plane itself is comparable to Westjet's comfort, especially the Emergency Exit seats. Those are my go-to seats, I'm not sure about the front row but so far the Emergency Exit Seats are my favourite. I highly recommend for trips that are longer than 2 hours, or if you happen to be on the heavier side, no shame.  Swoop does not have free wifi or inflight entertainment, so make sure you have your own music/videos/movies downloaded beforehand. Food & beverages are overpriced like any flight, bring your own because snacks are life.

Of course, my husband could always call in sick tomorrow to pick us up, just to add to work disruption this one person's actions have caused. That said, it's not the crew member's fault. It's Swoops. Are you really telling me they do not have on-call crew members for such occasions? If not, they need to seriously consider a business plan rethink or maybe just shut down their entire operation.

Both legs arrived relatively on time (with about a 15-20 minute delay). Boarding was speedy and efficient in both instances and the overall experience was more than acceptable. My only gripe with Swoop is their luggage policy. I have flown with other Ultra low cost carriers in Europe (Pegasus, Ryanair, EasyJet) and never had I dealt with the type of scrutiny that these guys place on luggage. I was flying down with just a personal item on both legs. Leaving Hamilton, it was clear that my medium sized backpack fit comfortably under the seat (even though in all fairness when I tried to get it to fit in their ""luggage size testers"" it was virtually impossible. This was just a regular school sized backback, so this is a word of caution to anyone thinking of stuffing a backpack and thinking of getting away for a weekend with just a personal item. Leaving Vegas to return back to Hamilton is where I encountered my first issue (and probably only issue on this trip). Immediately at the check in counter I noticed that they had people aside (5-6 others) which they had marked as having bags too big to count as personal items. I was told that my backpack was too big and that I too, would have to pay to either have it checked or carry it on board (both fees were in the $75+ range). This is a word of caution to anyone thinking of getting away with it. Pay for the bag or make sure you have a small backpack and can make it work. They gave me a break this time, but based on all the other reviewers here it is very apparent that this is not the case most of the time. Wifi was slow on the flight, the menu surprisingly didn't even have cold sandwiches available, however, snacks and drinks are very reasonably priced ($5-$7 for beers or spirits, most snacks in the $3-$6 range). The aircrafts are all relatively new ex-WestJet B737-800 series planes and in both instances during my flights were clean planes. Cabin crew staff were pleasant and were helpful with whatever issues people had around me. Overall, you get what you pay for. In my case, if I am paying for my flights out of pocket I will definitely consider these guys again. I saved at least $200 Canadian with them for my round trip.

"""communication about delays was unacceptable""",5,2019-02-17,"On February 2 I flew out to B.C. on a flight with Swoop to visit my daughter. Had a great flight out to B.C. However, my return to Hamilton on February 6, 2019, was a different story. Ontario was dealing with an ice storm. At 6:30 am I received an email from Swoop that I could cancel my flight, due to the inclement weather. I would receive a complete refund, provided that I sent an email to Swoop. Unfortunately, I decided to be pro active, and cancelled my flight home to Ontario, even though they did not mention that the flight was cancelled or delayed. Thirty minutes later, I realized that the flight back to Ontario was still on schedule. I decided to rebook on the same plane to Hamilton. I was shocked to see that the price had doubled to $449.00 for a one- way ticket (WO106). However, I booked a new seat on the same plane. I rushed to the Abbotsford Airport, and tried to explain to the Swoop attendant that I wanted to cancel the new booking, and keep my original booking for the same flight. The attendant was on the phone for quite awhile, explaining the situation, and she confirmed that I was back on my original plan and that the airline was refunding the $512.00 onto my credit card for the one- way ticket home. I was given a boarding pass, and everything was good. Once through security it was announced at the airport that the plane was delayed 5 hours. Because we were landing in Ontario after 10 pm, I decided to book a night at the Super 8 at $145.77. Finally, we were called to board the plane around 3:00 pm. (original flight time was 10:20 am). Just before take off, an attendant called out my name, and ordered me OFF the plane! I was travelling alone, confused and devastated! The attendant went to the computer and noticed that I was cancelled off of both bookings.The attendant admitted to Swoop’s mistake  and the best they could offer was a booking on the next plane with $100.00 off the new price of $449.00. Unfortunately, the next plane back to Hamilton was on Thursday, February 7 at 10:00 pm, landing on Friday, February 8 at 5:30 AM! I was scheduled to work on Friday! I then decided to find a flight on WestJet that would get me home on Thursday, February 7. The entire trip home cost me an extra $663.02 because of Westjet's one way flight cost ($598.30), another night at a hotel ($136.82), no refund on the cancelled Super 8 Hotel ($145.77), and cab fares,etc. The emotional distress to me because of Swoop's error was huge. Travelling alone, without my luggage, far away from home, was the worst day I had experienced in a very long time. I know the risk in travelling during the winter months, but the communication within Swoop about delays, was unacceptable. They knew that the flight to Ontario was delayed, yet waited until I was sitting in the airport, already checked in, to announce it? I would have never cancelled my original flight, if I knew that it might not be cancelled? Even though I enjoyed the lower cost of flight and the convenience of a direct flight to B.C., I was devastated by the experience getting home.

Of course, none of us can control the weather, but an airline can control the customer service it offers its passengers. This is where Swoop failed so miserably. Swoop ground staff had no idea how to handle the situation in front of them effectively. They gave conflicting information. They behaved rudely. they clearly couldn't care less about the individuals involved and the impact it was having on them. Yes, people were upset, but their vacation plans had just been ruined. For the folks working at the airport, this is just their job. Provide customer service and do it well. Well, they didn't do that. on the plane, the flight crew advised us to contact swoops customer service department in Calgary. Of course, anybody who tried to do so immediately learned that Swift customer service in Calgary was closed. Since the cancellation, it has just been a continued serious of frustrations trying to contact and get any kind of satisfaction out of swoop. It might look like you're saving money when you see the Swoop price, but to my mind, it isn't worth the hassle. Don't let them ruin your vacation. I ended up flying on a different airline out of a different airport the morning following the Swoop disaster.

This was great since it was a red eye. They loved my little girl and gave her all kinds of free food. On the way back we got into our seats and one seat had a ‘do not occupy’ sign on it. So once boarding was over they moved us and they ended up bumping us up to premium economy! We just brought a backpack each and checked one bag.

I asked him why they didn't change their computer check in status then because at 3:40 Tuesday AM the flight was still on time. I cut him off and I told him what the staff in Hamilton told us - it was delayed because the pilot came to work but was unable to fly and so they needed to find a pilot and fly him in and then the rest of the crew would be over there regulated time so they needed to fly them in. He stopped fighting with me then but then said that the $30.00 person coverage for food d/t the delay was only $10.00 per person. Once again I told him we had been told by Swoop staff in Hamilton that it was $30.00 person. He said they made a mistake at the airport for telling us this.

Downside: no public transport whatsoever at Abbotsford, prepare to take a taxi to the city center or to be picked up by someone you know. Both flights were on time. The amenities on board are way better than Ryanair. In-seat power, in flight entertainment via wifi and movable neckrests were available at every seat. This is even comparable to Westjet and Air Canada and well beyond low cost carrier standard. However, recline was minimal, so sleeping was not quite possible in this upright position. If you bring a neck cushion it's okay. On board amenities for purchase were limited but reasonable priced. 3.99 for headphones or 4.99 for a bowl of ramen soup are fine in my opinion.

Considering this is a low cost airline, we knew we’d would have to pay for any extras which is typical for any budget airline. Booking was simple and the cost of add-ons was clear. Prompts for extras could quickly be by-passed if not required. We didn’t pay extra for seat selection as we don’t really mind where we sit on a plane and we were ok if we were not seated together for a short flight. Both times when we checked in manually before arriving at the airports, we were assigned adjacent seats anyways. Clear convenient options were provided at check in to print your boarding pass, download it, or have it emailed to you. Rules regarding minimal check-in time, baggage check-in, boarding time, restrictions, in-flight costs etc were very clear and repeated through-out the process. It was also clear if you were late and missed the minimum check in times, you would not be allowed to board and the plane would not wait for late passengers.  When we arrived at the airport there was no line up, staff was efficient and friendly, and our check in was very quick. Flight was on time, the airplane was clean, and staff nice. An information announcement was made to download the Swoop app for entertainment. (I had already downloaded the app when booking our flight and found it user friendly). We had checked one bag which we retrieved quickly upon arrival and were on our way. Our flight back was a very similar experience. Check-in was quick again with a minimal wait and 4 staff members available. We were pleasantly surprised with the offer of upgraded seats on the emergency exit aisle which had a lot more leg room. Just after we cleared security, we received an email notification advising our flight was delayed 30 minutes which was fine as things happen and our flight boarded and left right on time for the new departure time. Again the plane was clean and the staff friendly.

The weather outside had gotten even worst, raining and so windy that the plane was shaking while even on the ground but because they’re too cheap to actually let us off at Pearson so they don’t have to pay to land there, we were heading back into a storm worst than what diverted us in the first place. They would not let anyone exit in Toronto. At this point you have babies screaming, everyone’s hot, thirsty and annoyed and the flight crews response was “we want to go home too and we don’t get paid while on the ground”. They announce that we were waiting to refuel and we would then be back up in the air for our “12 minute flight to Hamilton”. This went on for another hour at least to wait to refuel.

When we arrived in Edmonton, my daughter realized that she would not be able to fly back with me on September 2nd. So she went online to the swoop website and cancelled her flight.

When I returned to the Edmonton airport on Sept. 2nd for the return flight , I was told that my flight was cancelled also and that I would need to rebook for $200+. I tried to explain the website cancellation had been only for my daughter, and not me, but they really didn't care and said it was out of their hands. I argued and asked to see a manager, but to no avail. I am now going into hour 2 of being on hold to try and get some resolution to this issue.. Customer service is pathetic. The agents in Edmonton were terrible, under trained and not the least bit interested in trying to problem solve for a paying customer. They are only capable of looking at a computer screen and reading back what it says. Swoop has lost me as a customer.  I actually waited 2 hours and 5 minutes before being connected with an actual Swoop rep. She said it is impossible to make partial cancellations online. We went round and round until I asked to speak to her manager The manager also insisted that Heather, my daughter must have cancelled both reservations and no matter how much I insisted that the website had said ""Heather J.... confirm cancellation"" she would not acknowledge that this happened. She said partial reservations can only be cancelled by telephoning a customer service representative. I suggested that if every customer who wanted to cancel a partial reservation had to wait 2 hours to actually talk to a person ( as I did today) that perhaps their website and systems needed fixing. She stated they were thinking about changing the system but had not yet done so. She also stated that the reason I had to wait so long today is that they were backlogged with calls because their call centre was closed on Saturday and Sunday! What the hell!! She then covered that tidbit of info by saying that they do have agents who respond to emails 24/7!! So here's what I got from all that. Don't use their website to cancel partial reservations because their system can't handle it.  Instead call them directly(which by the way, they state will cost you $15.00 plus applicable taxes and it may take 2 hours + to get an answer!

In that case you will have to email them and I have no idea how long their response to an email might take! Totally laughable!

I had bought the Modifly option, and they did not acknowledge it, or offer a solution to rebook or reschedule. On their main website, there is no link to sign into your account!

And I actually prefer it that way, as travelling with young children, they are on your lap and moving quite a bit, and reclining seats take up valuable space. The biggest issue that came up involved our car seat. We checked it in oversized luggage in Edmonton, and it did not make it on to our plane. There was another family in the same situation when we arrived in Hamilton. Swoop offered us replacements for the missing car seat, and boosters for the other family. On the spot, we were issued new in-the-box seats and a follow-up and return of our missing equipment was promised. This situation went from panic, (as it is illegal and unsafe to transport a young child without a car seat, so we were effectively stranded) to a reasonable and fair solution.

"""budget airline is a great option""",10,2018-08-07,"Hamilton to Winnipeg. This budget airline is a great option for anyone looking to save money with no-frills flying. I was hesitant to use it, since a lot of the reviews were quite horrible, but after my experience I don't understand where these other people are coming from. First of all, I had no issues getting on board, if you follow the times and rules you will have no issues, as with any other airline. If they say you must check in by a certain time and you don't, and you cannot get on because of that, that is your fault not a problem with the airline. My first flight was delayed by an hour, which wasn't great but these things happen, and we were politely kept informed through everything. They let us know as soon as the delay happened, through the app and through the announcement in the terminal. They updated us when maintenance crew was on their way, when they arrived, when they were completed, and when we could start boarding. It honestly was more information than I would have expected from any airline. I did not pay for extra legroom seating and still found the space adequate, mind you I am not a large or tall person. The space is less than you get from non-discount airlines but not as significant of a difference as I was expecting from the comments. There were people behind me with extra legroom and they commented how good it was, so I believe if you are worried that would be a good option for you. You'd likely still save money even after the extra costs. The seats were not comfortable but not much less than an average flight, I would struggle on a long-haul flight in them (mine was a 2 hour flight) as with any long-haul flight, but for short distances it was fine and again, I think the difference in comfort wasn't much compared to the difference in price. The flight attendants and pilot were some of the friendliest I have experienced from any airline and were incredibly helpful and entertaining, this part especially made the flight seem less budget-oriented. They do nickle-and-dime you for everything, and I paid $30 each way for carry-on luggage, so if you are pricing airlines be sure to account for any of these extra charges you may want added on when you are comparing prices. You also have to pay per hour ($6.49/hour) for the in flight wifi which I didn't know going in, so I just skipped using, but the people beside me connected and streamed movies on their phone without issues. All that being said, I paid less than half of what I would with any other airline. The flight cost was just over $300 there and back and usually the trip would have cost me over $700. This made it so I could actually afford to go see family, so I am very grateful to Swoop for providing this service! If you are truly a traveller on a budget this is a great option! I had zero issues and you likely will too. If you are looking for all the above and beyond comforts, you shouldn't be looking at discount airlines anyways.

However, she waived that fee. So, $50 and taxes for each ticket and they also kept my money for my bag which for two tickets, was the entire amount!

The counter agents where rude and unsupportive. They offered no solutions to my problem, just said I would not be getting on the flight. I phoned swoop and waited to for an hour on the phone to speak to an agent. The agents were rude and unfriendly. Both the agent and manager told me they would not put me on a flight home tomorrow and would not give me anything for my missed flight. They said it was my fault I missed the flight and were unsupportive and unsympathetic. I realize now that the fine print says you have arrive 45 minutes prior to leaving. Unfortunately life happens and when travelling with children you sometimes fall behind. The complete lack of support, kindness and professionalism was disgusting.

"""upset about the luggage fees""",1,2018-07-12,"I booked a flight for my son, daughter and I on Swoop to visit family in August 2018. Unfortunately, due to a work conflict my son was not able to join. I cancelled the trip 3 weeks before we were to travel. I understand, though am not happy with the fact that the refund is Swoop credit that expire in 90 days. What I am really upset about is the luggage fees. We were only going to travel with 2 suitcases between the 3 of us. I purchase one for my ticket and one for my sons. Since he is no longer travelling the money we paid is gone, not refunded and not transferable to my daughter who is still part of the original reservation. My daughter and I still need a second suitcase which I now need to purchase again. So I lost the seat selection fee, lost the $60 I paid to check a suitcase and need to pay another $60 to get the second suitcase on board even though I originally paid for 2. My flight east is now more expensive the with the other more common airlines and I still get only the discounted service. As a person who travels a lot for business and personal this is a real shame.

"""go in with zero expectations""",2,2018-07-12,"Not Verified |  We flew Swoop from Hamilton to Edmonton at the end of June with two toddlers. The flight to Edmonton from Hamilton was fine, the wifi did not work the entire flight which was annoying but the rest of the amenities on board were pretty standard. Our July 7th flight home on the other hand was non-existent. Swoop advises passengers check-in closes 45 minutes before the flight, we arrived 1 hour before our flight, there were 2 attendants working the check-in counter both had passengers with ""issues"", by the time the couple ahead of us got to the wicket the attendant stated ""sorry the flight has been cut we cannot check you in"". That was it, done deal. Our flight was scheduled for 10:25am, check-in closed at 9:40am, the couple in front of us got to the wicket at 9:53am the two attendants knew we were all in line waiting but made no attempt to get assistance or put the passengers with issues aside to get us checked in. Swoop's attendants left us stranded in the airport with a customer service number that was useless. We received zero compensation and had to pay an additional $1500 to get our family home with another airline. To top it all off the flight was delayed due to lightning and did not leave till after 10:25am - we absolutely could have made our flight. I do not recommend flying this airline, the staff from the check-in desk to the customer service call center is uncompassionate and extremely rude.

With the new departure time we arrived at the airport to check in at 4:30pm. My husband went to return the rental car and I went to check our bag, we were already checked in. The gate agent told me they were closed. I said ‘What are you talking about?’ and she pointed to a sign telling me there was a customer service number I could call. I called the number and customer service was closed on Sundays. I chased her down because she left the desk and she said she was going to get a supervisor. I kept saying this doesn’t make sense and she told me the plane wasn’t even there yet. I called my husband and told him they’re not letting us on the plane. The supervisor came and she confirmed this. I said I have a 4 year old and a 2 year old I had to get home to and she didn’t care. My husband in the mean time called WestJet customer service. Long story short the supervisors phone rang and my husband said ‘We’re getting on the plane right?’ She nodded. We are very frequent flyers with WestJet. We were told we were getting on the plane but our bag would not be travelling with us. We live 3.5 hours from the airport in NS. When I called the next day it was in the notes we were irate and the customer service agent called us liars, they wanted us to pay to get our bag to us. A girlfriend was going to the airport and got it for us. I was horrified at how we were treated when we were there 15 minutes before the 45 minute cut off time listed on their website. Everything else could have been ok but that kind of fear, to be left there with no where to go when I have young children at home makes this airline not worth anything.

However, they did not allow my carry one in even though I have fully paid for it. They even not accepted the credit, that I have paid for the Carry one, to be applied to the newly incurred charge of $42 (for checked bag at the time of boarding). It's totally outrageous.

"""The pricing was amazing""",9,2018-07-05,The pricing was amazing. The pricing was amazing and the cost to check a bag was comparable to other airlines when I booked my flight ($260 round trip with a checked bag there and back!). The staff were very friendly and I had no issues with either flight. Both flights were on-time or very close to on-time. They offered free inflight entertainment for the summer as a promo which was great but did cut out a bit throughout the flight. A heads up that they only accept major credit cards for inflight purchases. I can see connecting flights being an issue as other customers experienced. I don't think I would book a connecting flight due to the limited time options and that there is no guarantee it will depart or arrive on time. Check in was easy online and like any airline you need to adhere to their strict check in times so I made sure to arrive early in case there was any issue. The seats are small but again they are trying to get as many people on as possible to give a discount. If you need more room pay the extra for more space.

"""how uncompassionate they were""",1,2018-06-28,"Hamilton to Halifax. I have flown a lot, and never have I been treated so terribly. I was unable to check in online due to a computer system error and we arrived 5 minutes late for the 45 minute check in at the airport. We had no bags to be checked and apologized that we were not there at the 45 minute mark. A stewardess was so nice and said it was no problem; the flight is delayed because they just waited 20 minutes for passengers on the incoming flight because ""we don't leave any passengers behind"". (Please mind you the Hamilton airport takes 5 minutes to get threw security). A pilot came out from the incoming flight and told us he couldn't get us through - another passenger came after us and they helped her get threw because she checked in online but would not help us. I called customer service and the lady was extremely rude telling me it was all my fault. I told her I understood we had just missed the 45 minute mark but we had a 9 month baby at home who did not have a place to stay tonight. She was rude, but said she would change the system only this one time so we could board. She heard the other late passenger being helped and said ""oh it looks like you are being taken care of so I don't need to help you"". The supervisor at the airport refused to let us through security and told us to call the call center only after the plane was fully boarded. She showed no compassion and told us we should have been on time. I called customer service back and they said they charge low prices so there would be no compensation or help rebooking a flight. After telling them how uncompassionate they were for only being flying for a few days they told us they would send one of us home the next day, and the other 6 days later. We told them that was unacceptable and they said ""that is your choice"". We ended up not getting any compensation or help rebooking. We paid 700$ for another flight with another airline so we could get home to our daughter at Pearson Airport. Moral of this very long story is do not fly with this airline.
