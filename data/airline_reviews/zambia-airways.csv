"""Nice staff, water served ad libitum""",7,2022-09-15,"Flew Lusaka to Ndola via Solwezi 11 Sept. 22 on an old De Havilland Dash 8 propeller aircraft. The airline has been revoked by financial infusion from Ethiopian and appear to be very reliable according to statistics and my experience. Zambia Airways has only this sole aircraft only but 2 new aircrafts are ordered incl. a B737. Flight on time. Luggage generous, but no space for hand-luggage, it has to go as inscribed (except my laptop). Nice staff, water served ad libitum which was welcomed on a hot day. Noisy, but cosy. Luggage no issues. Price cheaper than the private competitor Proflight Zambia which further have only 15 kg luggage allowance. Homepage excellent, fast and friendly.
