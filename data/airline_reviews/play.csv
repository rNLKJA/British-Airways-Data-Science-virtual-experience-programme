"""Not enough time between transfers""",2,2022-11-19,"Not enough time between transfers. They failed to take ""Boarding"" off the roster and I did not make it in time. This was because I was directed by an airport worker to go all the way to ""Arrivals"" between flights which was incorrect. By the time I got back the gate had closed 5 min before and they turned me and others away, telling us to go elsewhere and buy another ticket out. Ours were worthless and they were not willing to allow us on the plane, which was still being boarded on the tarmac. 40 min between two long international flights isn't practical. When I went to the help desk for Play, I was told I should have been able to make the flight and that all others had made it. When I told her that wasn't true, she stated again that I was. I reminded her I'm not deaf or blind, and that the very last person she had at her counter was there because she too missed this flight for the same reason. She told me she wasn't able to credit my ticket, so I moved ten feet down the line and bought one from Icelandic Air (way better than the other three flights I had on Play). I did the wrong thing by trying to go with an economical, new airline. It ended up costing me over $1,000 to correct this. Other things to mention is that they don't offer long layovers or open jaw flights. Too new for me, and I suggest you let them work out all their growing pains prior to flying with them. Pack some beverages because they don't even offer water. No gluten free food options, just candy so pack hard if you have dietary needs because there is NO TIME to eat between flights.

After I previously set up my account and input all of the required information for me and my family, I got a green checkmark for all 3 of us indicating our profile and information was complete. When I accessed my account later to check in, it said the information was incomplete! It took a long time to figure out that our country of residence (USA) that was previously entered was now missing and we had to enter it again after we thought we were cleared earlier when the reservation was made. The staff at the check in counter in Stuart Airport was unacceptably rude. Every single member of your flight attendant staff on your airplanes in both directions was outstanding.  Both aircraft were spotlessly clean. The seats on both flights lacked enough cushioning for a 5 to 6 hour flight. They were very uncomfortable compared to your competition. The low cost of your ticket prices initially caused us to select PLAY Airlines for our travel to Iceland. In the end when I checked out and paid for the tickets, I was surprised to see all the extra fees added to the ticket price. I suggest you include all of these extra fees in the ticket price so your customers know exactly what they are paying and don't feel swindled. I have flown over 1 million miles on United Airlines and I always receive a complimentary upgrade to Economy Plus, I can select my seat assignment free of charge, I am entitled to 1 free carry on in addition to my Personal item and I can check 2 bags that weigh up to 70lbs. each free of charge. These benefits are extended to anyone traveling with me on the same reservation. After paying for these things on PLAY including all the taxes, departure fees, etc, the price I ended up paying for each ticket was slightly less than I would have paid on United. Since I would have a movie screen with free movies, music at my seat and I would have received valuable mileage on my frequent flyer account on United, the slight savings for the PLAY tickets definitely was not the bargain I was expecting and not worthwhile. I realize that due to my extensive travel giving me my special privileges with United and Star Alliance partners, I am not a typical passenger.

By the end I had paid nearly an additional $250 for various catches, screw ups, and obstacles from this sin of an airline. This isn’t counting food or drinks — I packed my own — and bought my carry on luggage ahead of time. I flew from Baltimore to Reykjavik and hours before I arrived at the airport I tried several times to check in online. Each time the website was broken and I could not get a digital boarding pass.

I went back to the counters and explained the problem, and the attendants informed me I needed to show a negative COVID result to fly. I brought three rapid (antigen) tests with me, which the US accepts for re-entry, and said no problem, I was happy to take one. They said I needed a “certificate,” and apparently the only way to accomplish this was to take a cab to a nearby testing center ($35 round trip and pay for one of their antigen tests (same tests I had) which cost $54. None of this information was available on the airline’s website or any of the emails I received from them. At this point I was cutting it close, and the attendants made me wait another 25 min when I was back before I got my negative result. Finally, I was allowed in line to check my bag. I explained the issue with the carry on again, and that it fit their measurements, but they told me I had to purchase a checked bag instead.

The gentleman checking in our bags kindly let us know about a pharmacy in the airport that may be able to get the test in time to make the flight.
