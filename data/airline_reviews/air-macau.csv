"""had a great experience""",9,2019-02-01,"I had a great experience flying with Air Macau yesterday. Was surprised that other reviewers have rated them so low. In particular, their reservations team were really helpful when we had problems with our travel agent, travelgenio. Our original flight was cancelled by Air Macau 2 weeks before departure, which was annoying but they offered us a selection of four alterative flights (via our travel agent). Our travel agent then gave us the wrong rebooked flight details. We therefore didn't turn up to the airport for the flight and we looked like a no show to Air Macau. Travel agent took no responsibility for their error and we were worried we would have to pay for a new ticket. However, a quick call to Air Macau customer services and they rebooked us onto a flight the following day for no extra charge. Brilliant! Departure experience: There was a bit of a queue at check in but not abnormally long. 1.5hr flight included a pork roll, cookie and water which was a nice touch. All the staff were friendly too. I suppose one downside was that there was no inflight entertainment and electrical sockets, but that didn't bother us on such a short flight. I would definitely fly with them again.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Macau to Taipei,January 2019,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",5,5,,True,
"""the most unreliable airline""",1,2018-04-17,"Hangzhou to Macau. I have had the misfortune of flying Air Macau numerous times over the past 6 years. On virtually every occasion the flight has been late, often by at least 2 hours. The airline has the annoying habit of boarding passengers first, and only then informing them of the delay, creating a long and frustrating wait on the tarmac. The Macau - Beijing route seems particularly liable to delay, but recently I have travelled on Air Macau to Hangzhou and Nanjing and both flights were 2 hours+ late, with little or no explanation. Air Macau gives the impression that it simply does not care. After many years of international travel, Air Macau is quite simply the most unreliable airline I have ever had the misfortune to fly on.",True,A319,Business,Economy Class,Hangzhou to Macau,April 2018,2,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,False,1
Air Macau customer review,7,2017-07-21,"✅ Verified Review |  Beijing to Macau. Air Macau is the only one carrier operating 3 daily flights from Beijing to Macau. The aircraft they use on this route is A321. The flight attendants can speak English well, but the service do not have any shining spot. Dinner is provided on this flight, which tastes not too bad. Although the plane delayed for 30min to get airborne, due to traffic of Beijing Airport, the flight made landing 10min earlier than estimated, which surprised me.",False,A321,Business,Economy Class,Beijing to Macau,February 2017,4,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",4,4,,False,1
"""attendants were a mix bag""",5,2017-04-17,"✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to Macau with Air Macau. Check-in in BKK was painful. The line was long and extremely slow moving. Check-in staff in BKK seemed busier chatting / messaging on their cellphones. The agent who was checking us in was unpleasant and unprofessional. She was busier message chatting on her phone when we reached the check-in counter. She didn't know the dimension of cabin baggage yet tried to deny my IATA cabin certified carry-on. Then, she started ""lecturing"" my 67 years old mother and I on Macau immigration requirements, imply us as potential over-stayers. I am an economist at an international organization and I travel on a monthly basis for work and leisure; I used to work in the air transport sector myself and I have lived in 6 different countries and I am very well informed with immigration requirements.  Finally, we only receive our boarding passes after the involvement of check-in supervisor. On the other hand, kudos to check-in personnel at MFM. Check-in was a breeze - the line was fast moving, and personnel were friendly, helpful and efficient. No personal IFE on board; seats for both ways were very uncomfortable; food was average but only water was offered. Flights were slightly delayed both directions.

"""worse than a budget airline""",2,2017-01-12,"✅ Verified Review |  No pre-flight selections of seats. All seats have to be assigned upon checkin at airport counter in Macau and in Bangkok. This procedure takes forever and so time consuming. Flight experience on the return trip, Bangkok/Macau was horrific. The flight was scheduled for 9:50 pm but was delayed for at least an hour. Was warned that this airline on-time performance is terrrible and it sure is. In addition, cabin temp was too hot making it impossible to breathe. Never again will I fly with this airline.

"""the poor condition of the plane""",5,2017-01-01,"✅ Verified Review |  I used Air Macau for a round-trip from Tokyo to Narita. I was able to get the tickets for a quite low price, so I was not expecting much from this airline. At the end, I was able to get a fair flight from them, but there were still some issues that made my journey inconvenient. The thing that bugged me was that some items in the cabin seemed to either have issues or was non-functional. One of them was the tray tables. It was mandatory for me to use it as both of my flights included 1 meal. But, whenever I try to place my food tray on it, it keeps sliding towards me. It was quite annoying at the time. Also, in one of my flights my seat recliner was broken. Despite the poor maintenance, the cabin staff was very friendly and helpful on both of my flights.  Overall, Air Macau is a minor airline and passengers shouldn't expect much from them. If you are a person that doesn't mind the poor condition of the plane and want a straight flight to Macau, then I would recommend this airline to you. If not, then I would rather suggest taking other flights heading to Hong Kong and using the ferry from Hong Kong to Macau.",False,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,NRT to MFM,December 2016,2,3,,3,3,,True,

"""not very impressed with safety""",3,2016-06-11,"✅ Verified Review |  Hanoi to Macau with Air Macau, and not very impressed with cabin crew and safety procedures. I fly a lot and have used many different airlines. It appeared that the staff were not interested in doing their job properly. The passenger in front of me never put on his seat belt once, (take off and landing included) and not one member of staff checked or asked him to do so. The woman in the isle seat next to me had 3 bags which she held on her knee and at her feet, a flight attendant came to answer her question about how long the flight would take, but negated to request the passenger to put her luggage in the stow compartment during take off and landing. Some seats remained reclined during decent. I will mention (and this may reflect on the airport) but once we were off the aircraft we were put onto a bus to take us to the gate, as the door opened there was a lot of pushing and shoving from passengers to be the first one off and through to passport check. I had to hold onto a rail so that I would not be pushed over. I have never experienced anything like this.

Each of the four flights were delayed between 10 minutes and an hour and a half. Not a single on time departure on my trip. This airline seems to a have its pilots climb and descend very rapidly. There are economic advantages to this type of flying but it can be uncomfortable on your ears. Cabin temperature inconsistent, hot at times and cold at times. For food, ""fish rice"" was the only option on one of the legs, the other also had a chicken and rice meal. I am 6'4"" so very sensitive to seat pitch.

The weather in both Osaka and Macau were very cold at the time, yet the cabin temperature was almost 30 degree Celsius. It was so hot that it was unbearable. Several passengers reflect the issue to the flight attendants yet nothing was done. It was like sitting in the baking oven. It was the worst 4 hour flight I have experienced. There were apparent difference in temperature between front section and rear section of the cabin (much hotter in the front and mid section). Maybe that's why the flight attendant who were staying in the back did not take passengers' request seriously.

Air Macau customer review,6,2014-02-12,An hour late leaving Taipei. Plane seating was very tight but ok for me. Staff immaculate and very polite - probably this airlines saving grace. Food was hot but a bit bland. Couldn't hear hostess or pilot on the intercom. Return flight was ok smaller airbus but seating adequate. Again food was nice and hot but I had to ask for tea which should be served after meal. I didn't expect too much from an hour and a half flight but they could supply headphones and music.

Air Macau customer review,2,2009-02-04,Flew Air Macau from Tapei to Macau and back during the Chinese New Year. A321 were deployed at the TPE-MFM sector. Economy class was full seats were cramped but bearable for the 1.5 hr flight. Food was poor. MFM-TPE sector had no boarding bridge so has to take the bus to the aircraft. Which I find it quite annoying given how small the Macau International Airport was and not much traffic go through Air Macau still can't find a boarding bridge. Again food was poor on the way back. Crew on both flight were efficient though but lack of smile and can clearly felt that they were treating Business Class passengers better when the curtain between the two classes is still open.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,

Air Macau customer review,,2007-07-26,Taipei To Beijing which transfered in Macau. Economy class seat was incredibly small.

Air Macau customer review,,2007-02-01,Y class MFM-BKK. Check-in with few smiles actually but smooth not charged any excess baggage charge despite being slightly overweight departure on time. Onboard the staff were polite and cheerful helped lifting heavy hand baggage in overhead locker and present throughout the whole flight. Language skills good and attentive in all our needs. Offered music headset pillow and blanket and at time of meal served also main course choice: appreciated that. Good security instructions by video presentation and good IFE with an interesting travelog film. Wide duty free choice. Toilet conditions could have been much better!

I would recommend it also for its good fares and I would definitely prefer to fly again with them instead of trying low-cost competitors on same route.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Macau customer review,,2006-06-30,Shanghai to Taipei The flight was delayed for more than 3 hours without explanation. Eventually we were informed to board an A300.

Air Macau customer review,,2005-05-06,"Macau-Bangkok - business class. The airline changed its departure time without notifying me from 6pm to 11:30pm! Fortunately I found out by accident. My experience with the ground crew and Macau airport personnel was similar - poor or no English. The Business Class Lounge lady told me ""no more food go downstairs"". When I went to the restaurant there was almost no food left. We finally departed at almost 12:00 midnight amidst great confusion. Onboard the service was very polite the food was ample but mediocre entertainment system was retro with service announcements that seemed to occur every 15 minutes. Air Macau is not cheap.

Air Macau customer review,,2004-04-21,I flew Air Macau SHA-MFM-TPE-MFM-SHA. The service was OK; the FA's spoke all English and were very polite.

We had to wait 2 hours for the luggage to arrive in SHA. Nobody of the ground staff spoke English; I had to ask a passenger to translate. As Air Macau's prices are not cheap at all it's a shame how they treat their passengers especially on the ground.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Macau customer review,,2003-04-20,I had a trip to Beijing with Air Macau. The first flight from Taipei to Macau. The cabin clean and new but the seat small. The service of cabin crews is bad. They never smile during the flight. When they took the meal to passengers they didn't say thanks or you are welcome. The breakfast was poor. Next flight was from Macau to Beijing. I changed aircraft and cabin crew on this flight. This aircraft is larger but the seat and service was still bad. A crew was really impatient when I wanted to buy some duty-free items. The entertainment was poor. They didn't have movies on a three hour flight. The program was almost the same as TPE/MFM flight. The third flight from Beijing to Maca - a very excellent flight. Cabin crew friendly and polite - food was delicious. My last flight from Macau to Taipei. Bad service bad food and bad entertainment. Air Macau earns a lot of money flying between Taiwan and China. I think they should improve most of their service (seat pitch entertainment meal etc.). They should educate cabin crews to be more courteous to passengers. Their service is worse than EVA Air and TransAsia Airways on TPE-MFM route.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Macau customer review,,2003-03-21,A very good airline! Flew Macau to Beijing and back. The plane was new and clean but the food was poor-noodles in a brown sauce and a vanilla cake. The cabin staff however were great! They all spoke English they were polite and well dressed and they found American magazines for us to read being the only Western pax on board.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Macau customer review,,2003-03-17,I just completed a round trip on SIN to MFM by Air Macau two days ago. The aircrafts (A319 and A321 ) are new and clean. The pilot gave comprehensive flying details in English and the cabin staff repeated the pilot comment in Chinese. This is good service as Air Macau is highly dependent on Taiwanese and China market exclusively where the passenger may not understand the pilot comments. The cabin staff are attentive and respond fast to the passenger demand. Food is good and the seat is comfortable. One setback is the flight entertainment. They have no movie shown onboard except for a short documentary show last for about one hour. I guess Air Macau majority Flight times are normally less than 2.5 hours and the time may not permit a movie program. Maybe they should consider to feature movie programs for flight to Beijing Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. Overall Air Macau a relative new airline with only 9 years of operation has done well and I will fly with them again.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
