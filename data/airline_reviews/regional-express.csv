I went up to speak to the flight attendant anxious whether cleaners might have removed it and taken it into the terminal and we might take off without it. She ignored me for several minutes before finding it (she had removed it - although we had booked the same seats right through of course - and the plane wasn't full so she should even have remembered us!) and returning it without a word of apology.

Return was also great with pilot greeting us at the stairs and we took off pretty well on time. A bit bumpy out of Sydney which were warned about but cabin staff looked after us and landed in Albury about 5 mins ahead of schedule. Overall it was flying as it was meant to be.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,,True
Regional Express customer review,8,2014-02-12,SYD-LSY (Lismore)-SYD: this is a great little airline: good aircraft good service at check-in nice personnel service on-board and Lismore Airport and its terminal are a delight. I only wish REX serviced the main trunk routes in Australia as a 'boutique airline'. On-time performance and luggage arrives into the terminal before the passengers arrive.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,,True
Regional Express customer review,10,2013-08-12,Flew Sydney-Albury with my 18 month child great friendly service at check in gave my daughter her own seat at no extra charge since plane was not full. Pram was over weight but accepted still free of charge cabin crew were just as great gave personal demonstration of how to put a child's life vest on. Was asked to wait for everyone else to leave the plane first in Albury before us and the flight attendant assisted us off with our carry on right through to the terminal. Would definitely fly with Rex again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,,True
Regional Express customer review,10,2013-03-04,Albury-Sydney return in 2 days. Great service on the ground and in the air. Albury is a small regional airport so no lining up to check in and all done with a polite smile. Boarding very organised and I had paid extra ($4.00) for an exit row seat. One flight attendant who did a great job explaining what that meant. Took off right on time and landed in Sydney a few minutes late due bad weather. In flight we were offered tea or coffee and a snack and also water. Return trip was also great with the same seat (6 A) and the service was excellent. Landed 20 mins ahead of schedule and bags delivered at about the same time it took to walk to the terminal. Overall a great airline which serves many areas of regional Australia.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,,True
Regional Express customer review,9,2012-12-19,Merimbula to Sydney. This was my first trip with this airline and overall the experience was a positive one. Check in at Merimbula was efficient and polite. Boarding was on time and the hostess for our trip was extremely charming  smiling and chatting to passengers throughout the flight. Once in Sydney we were quickly bussed to the terminal and there was a very short wait for bags. Also found their fares quite reasonable if you book far enough ahead.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,,True
Regional Express customer review,3,2012-07-15,"When the flights work its a good service but 8 trips and 1 that is on time is not uncommon experience to orange residents. Constantly late constantly diverting to Bathurst constantly ""caught by surprise"" with busses and planes not working. Take my tip hire a car or catch the train/bus its quicker (6 out of 8 times I would have got there before the plane) and much cheaper.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Regional Express customer review,10,2012-01-27,Sydney to Albury. The fare was cheaper than some rivals on the route. Everything worked like clockwork from check-in to arrival. Check-in easy and friendly. Bussed out to the plane in a timely and orderly manner. Cabin comfort was quite reasonable given the size of the aircraft (Saab 340). The flight attendant gave personal and friendly service throughout the flight offering seconds of tea/coffee. The flight crew gave periodic updates including the fact that we were arriving 15 minutes early - amazing for such a short flight. The flight attendant personally checking with every passenger during the flight to ascertain if anyone wanted them to book ahead for a taxi and the offering of sweets prior to landing were charming touches. I'd happily fly Rex again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Regional Express customer review,7,2012-01-24,Great airline but sadly airfares costing too much nowadays. Yes regional services are more expensive but why fly when a 2 hour car journey is far cheaper. Staff at BWT generally are rude arrogant and do not provide a friendly service. Trying to connect to other airlines from REX is a nightmare because of the huge disparities in luggage allowance and even worse when you connect to an international flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Regional Express customer review,8,2010-01-17,Coober Pedy to Adelaide. Nice experience. Check in at a little Bungalow in the desert friendly ground staff. Unhealthy snacks like chips or something sweet but they also offered drinks. Seatback was not able to recline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Regional Express customer review,9,2009-10-26,SYD-Wagga. On time and friendly. Offered complimentary tea/coffee/water and a sweet or savoury snack for 1hr 15 min flight. My only concern with Rex is that with the props going it is very difficult to hear the flight attendant over the PA. Otherwise good and hard-working airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Regional Express customer review,5,2009-07-04,SYD-Parkes return travelling alone so had A seat (config is A-aisle-BC) the SAAB 340 is a good little plane and smooth. Friendly and efficient attendant both sectors. Tea coffee water and biscuits or chip snack served on this short 45 min flight. Good landings booking check-in boarding all quick and simple and the bag was on the carousel in Sydney as soon as I got inside.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,5,2009-06-26,Adelaide to Broken Hill return. What a great regional airline REX is. Our flights left and arrived on time. Boarding was pleasant and effective. FAs were pleasant helpful and efficient. A light snack was served on both flights. Check in fast and pleasant. Well done.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,2,2009-06-17,Have had to travel to Albury a couple of times over the last 3mthsand decided to try Rex. Check in staff at Sydney very friendly and helpful. Can't say same for Albury staff. There is no country charm from these check in staff. Perhaps Rex need to give some Customer service to these outlying ports where no one does regular checks on them. Cabin crew nice although on a one hour flight with only one cup of tea and snack rubbish not collected until top of decent.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,5,2009-05-21,Adelaide to Port Lincoln return. Inflight service is the best service includes choice of coffee tea wine or champagne + light snack muffin or savory snacks.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,5,2009-05-20,Early morning flight form Sydney to Wagga with a return the next day. Both flights departed on time and the cabin crew member on both legs were friendly and genuine. On each flight a coffee/tea and biscuit served - bags were on carousel by the time I reached the terminal. The bus trip out to the plane from the terminal at Sydney adds a nice touch and gives one a different view of the airport. This is a fantastic little airline with a real charm about it and its service standards are truly something to be admired. Well worth flying with.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,4,2009-04-21,"Sydney - Lismore / Ballina - Sydney. Efficient and pleasant check in procedures in Sydney. Unlike Jetstar this airline does not view baggage overweight as a revenue stream. My first row seat was very noisy and I later learnt that it is the rear seats that enjoy a lower sound level due to the location of teh engines. The one hostess on board worked hard at serving our full flight of 34 pax with a cookie & coffee. Plenty of seating leg room on the Saab Turboprop but the toilet is really for emergencies only. Small and not designed for anyone higher than 5'5'' or wider than 34"" waist. All in all a great little airline. Well run and worth flying with.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,5,2009-01-21,Sydney-Ballina-Sydney. Was really impressed with both flights. The small cabin was not an issue on 80min flights. Seats comfortable and adequate room. Only recommendation is to not take too much carry-on baggage as there is limited storage space. Both ways the flight attendants were helpful and happy. Great addition to both flights were the FAs who stopped to have a chat to passengers after they had served the small snack - either a museli bar or packet of shapes and either tea/coffee/water. On the flight up we were delayed 90mins due to mechanical problems. The weather in Byron meant some baggage had to be taken off so extra fuel could be put on board in case of diversion. Staff were helpful and dealt with it in a professional manner sending the remaining bags up on the afternoon Virgin flight. I'd recommend REX over Virgin and Jetstar. I payed less than half for the REX airfare than what the other two were offering and was twice as happy flying with them.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,5,2008-09-24,Melbourne to Albury and return. Great flights both ways. Very comfortable middle sized twin- turboprop Saab 340 seating 11 rows of 1+2 pax. Leather seats very comfortable and mounted quite high giving you lots of leg-stretching room. Wide too compared to Airbus A320. Pleasant FA's each time adequate snacks available. Only downside is that the taxes and fees more than double the cost of the fare so the choice between using this shorthaul route and hiring a car and just driving there is closer than it looks on first quote. Highly recommend Rex if you don't mind flying in smaller aircraft than 737s or A320s.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,5,2008-09-01,Sydney-Narrandera-Sydney return 27 August-29 August on Regional Express Airlines also known as REX. Great flights with good clean quiet cabin (no loud overhead pop music thank heavens!) good service with coffee and snacks and very pleasant smiling attractive FAs. I like the Saab 340 and also now generally prefer REX to Qantaslink partly because of the use of pop music over the PA system on Qantaslink these days. Remarkably quick baggage collection at REX in Terminal 2 at Sydney Airport partly because I suppose one has to travel by tarmac bus from the aircraft parked at very remote stands from this terminal and that takes some time. However it is an interesting journey. A nice professional airline and look forward to flying with REX again.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,5,2008-08-11,Sydney to Orange return. First experience with Rex. Compared to some of the larger domestic and international carriers Rex provided excellent service and warm friendly crew on both legs. Although only a 45 minute flight each way we were still provided with a snack and hot beverage. Baggage collection at Sydney was outstandingly quick. We'd fly them again. The checked baggage limit of 15 kg per person could provide a challenge for some people.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,4,2008-07-25,"Have flown with Rex 3 times Sydney - Albury and have a few more sectors booked. Small Saab aircraft - but that means quick boarding and disembarking! Relatively comfortable and flight crew very fast and efficient. Always with a smile. Although you wouldn't want to be taller than 6'3"" (I'm 6'3"") to sit in their seats - unless you can secure the emergency exit row! A pleasure to fly with.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,4,2008-03-12,"MEL BWT return; relatively easy check-in & boarding. On short (1 hour) flight tea/coffee & nibbles served by friendly FA. A minor problem was in the different configuration of the aircraft (all are Saab 340). On outward flight there were overhead lockers above the ""2 seat"" side of the aircraft but on the return when we had extra carry-on there was none. Fortunately the flight was only half full so we could store it under the next seat. They do a good job for a regional airline.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,,2008-03-12,Sydney-Griffith return. Comfortable trip although the Flight Attendant was very 'grumpy' going to Griffith. Refreshment was a glass of water and packet of savoury 'nibbles'. The return flight was equally comfortable although we were treated to an aerial tour of Sydney courtesy of ATC and the only airport in Australia that qualifies for Third World Status.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,,2007-07-28,SYD-GTH-SYD-CMA-SYD over a few days. REX is a charming airline with excellent staff attitudes. Check-in in Sydney was very good. On arrival at your destination the First Officer hops off the aircraft to welcome you to your destination. Aircraft are Saab 340s. You might be lucky and get one with sheepskin covers on the seats. Good coffee or tea and a snack is served. Once again its the 'little' regional airlines that seem to be trying the hardest for their passengers.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,,2007-04-30,Sydney to Albury  Staff at Check-in genuine warm and inviting. On time departure on small and very full plane no room for much baggage. Just over an hour flying time . One crew operation and I was looking forward to a bubbly friendly crew member however this Hostess was abrubt and rude. Most of the short flight she stood in the flightdeck with door wide open talking with the flight crew. A little girl sitting opposite me travelling alone ( 6yr old ) pressed the call light 3times to no avail of the hostess. This was my first experience with REX and maybe I should try again as most comments posted here are positive.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,,2006-07-29,I fly each week with them and their service standards have to be amongst the best in the world. Last year they flew for the first time 1 million plus passengers to have no complaints on this site is a plus. Well done Rex.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,,2005-05-14,REX Is now flying to Cooma/Snowy Mountains airport as of 10th June (starting at AUD$129 one way all inclusive I think it's on the web). A number of airlines have tried to make it successful but it hasn't worked but with REX already having a good reputation and more financial support I think it might work. My only worry though is that the Airport is at 960m above sea level and is right on the Gt Div Range and it's flat and between to other ranges it is a pretty bad wind tunnel and if it snows (which is quite often in winter maybe once every 3 weeks) will the flights be cancelled?,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,,2005-05-10,Flew REX from Sydney to Lismore January 2005. Friendly check in staff flight attendant was very friendly. Small D8 style aircraft but I felt safe. The landing made for some great views landing into Lismore.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,,2005-01-17,In response to Alan Hume's post - Rex has just ditched it's Canberra-Sydney route. Bad news all round as Qantas is the only one flying to Sydney. I am predicting a sharp rise in CBR-SYD fares. Why should Qantas lower them? Who have they got to compete with? The flipside of the coin however is the leisure market and hopefully demand for low fares will ensure this remains the case.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,,2004-12-20,Also recently flew REX from Sydney to Canberra. Very friendly check-in staff member gave me Seat 6A (Emergency Exit) and was very friendly helping me as it was my first REX flight. Plane was small but comfortable. Kath the flight attendant was constantly smiling and helping passengers. Were given some water and mentos for the 30minute flight. I will definitely fly REX again. But unfortunately now the Sydney to Canberra service has been axed and Qantas now has a monopoly. Shame that REX has dropped this route but according to their website there are a few reasons why it's been unsuccessful.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,,2004-12-13,Recently flew Rex from Armidale to Sydney. The prices here just keep going down its fantastic (was 98 now 86 on special). Great cabin really friendly crew. A bikkie or packet of chips and a cuppa are quite sufficient though perhaps not so great if you're raher hungry but for a quick flight its just fine. Coming back from Canberra it was a really windy day and lots of flights were cancelled. Rex booked me at no cost onto both the CBR-SYD and SYD-ARM sectors. Perhaps my only gripe was trying to quickly speak to a rex person in Sydney checkin - the supervisor wasn't wearing anything that made her obvious and I actually thought she was just another passenger. But all smiles and repeat business here.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,,2004-09-29,"Yes I have to agree. I mean Rex has an excellent product but it should be focusing on regional routes. The simple fact is we are largely a ""Qantasised"" nation now and that's all there is to it. Alan Hume is right it's all about power and prestige and status (And sucking up to George W). What a self-centred bureaucracy this is turning into.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,,2004-09-28,"Rex has ditched its MEL-CBR run and has given notice that it will soon do likewise with the SYD-CBR service too if Govt business doesn't increase. The problem is unfortunately one of status and prestige. Exec Govt business fliers do not like ""small"" turboprop aircraft being bussed to the terminal from the aircraft having to declare to their colleagues in Qantas Club that they are flying Rex etc. etc. They like to be waited on hand and foot and have Business Class-size seats waiting for them at the end of a sealed corridor. It's a status/prestige thing that's all. If Rex could afford to operate midsize business jets on these premium services they would get more Govt business. Since this is not a viable option for them it must focus on regional services and forget the major trunk routes I fear to remain solvent.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,,2004-08-26,I had pleasant flight on REX  I had both SYD-CBR and CBR-MEL.... well done for Rex. Even though the costs and fleets they are using nowadays can't beat virgin and qantas but the service are unbeatable..overall I think they deserve more supports from all of us,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,,2004-08-12,Flew SYD-Ballina return on 6 & 10 August & very pleased with on time departures & early arrivals. Sole crew very friendly & helpful & fares very affordable compared to Virgin & Qantas on same route. Even my late check-in at SYD 15 minutes before take-off handled very efficiently & helpfully-unlike Jetstar these days. Flts not full and request for extra leg room seat very helpfully handled. Their promised new low fare regime deserves to be supported by Aussie passengers.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,,2004-05-25,I recently flew with REX from Adelaide to Melbourne and return and found them to be excellent. The staff were very friendly at checkin and on board - it was only 10 minutes longer than on other airlines (due to smaller aircraft) but the checkin was swift the baggage collection also efficient and all-in-all the same amount of time from checkin to baggage collection as with larger airlines (no huge queues at checkin or collection). Comfortable seating adequate snacks served on board. Wouldn't hesitate in flying with REX!,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,,2004-04-02,Yes the last couple of comments about REX are 100% correct. I fly with them up to 2 return trips a week from my regional NSW home so feel I am in a position to give an accurate and impartial view. The check in service at my regional airport and Sydney is outstanding the friendliness of the staff and the on time departures and arrivals(usually) is outstanding compared to the other players in the market.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,,2004-01-16,In response to a comment made on December 31 yes absolutely. Rex in my opinion help to keep the spirit of Ansett alive and I would be overjoyed for them to reinstate their Canberra-Melbourne service. There isn't much competition on that route and it would be good to see all of Australia's remaining three airlines serving it.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Regional Express customer review,,2003-12-31,Flew Rex from Sydney - Canberra last month and was pleasantly surprised by the level of service that is provided by Rex on such a short route(45min or so) Cabin hostess was extremely down to earth and friendly catering was quite good and we enjoyed breathtaking views on landing in Canberra. All in all I like Rex and think they should reinstate their Melbourne - Canberra service.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
