"""should improve their service attitude""",5,2020-02-12,"Not Verified |  Singapore to Dhaka. Flew with Regent Airways for the first time today. Is it the airline policy not to provide blankets to passengers? I thought it was a given in any airline.The staff mentioned to a male passenger it will be hot later on the plane so no need for blanket. What kind of explanation is that? Paying for ticket is also paying for the service and goods within the airline for that period of travel for usage. Also, the staff serving are not happy and don't smile.

"""Terrible experience""",1,2019-12-14,Terrible experience with Regent Air. I booked a round trip ticket from Singapore to Dhaka. The departing flight was delayed for 4 hours without any prior notice. The return flight was canceled without minimal effort to make an alternative arrangement.

If the counter lady have gave me the opportunity for transferring some of my accessories to my hand bag then problem solved. Moreover do 3kg very much overweight?

"""Not taking another Regent flight""",1,2019-02-23,"My 11:45 am flight from Coxs Bazar to Dhaka got rescheduled twice at 2:30 pm. Then, I went to check with Regent boarding desk at 2:15 pm to know that the flight has completed boarding at Dhaka only. Which means the flight from CXB is not taking off before 3:30 or 4 pm. This made me look at Regent Airways customer reviews and holy shit the review page didn’t have a single good customer review! A strong indicator that Regent Airways Management doesn’t prioritize anything between their flight timing, customer service, and overall flying experience.

But they didn’t mention that before. After sitting on the aircraft we came to know about that. We were stuck into the flight for all that time. The ground staffs behaviour was nice and professional.

"""don't recommend on international""",5,2018-12-21,"Cox's Bazar to Dhaka. The inbound flight was delayed by more than 1 hour due to dense fog at Dhaka which delayed the aircraft to come. The check in & luggage handling was quick & they made us board the plane as soon as the incoming passengers got of. The cabin crew need to improve their communication skills as they distributed mass snacks to the entire row of passengers & let the passengers of that row distribute snacks among themselves. It may be boring doing the same work again & again, but, still, a cabin crew can easily provide a sandwich to a passenger sitting beside the window in a single aisle aircraft.  Good airlines do operate old aircraft, but, its the attitude of the cabin crew & on board product that make all the difference. I don't recommend Regent on international routes as there are so many other airlines operate out of Bangladesh with outstanding on board services like Qatar, Singapore etc.",True,Boeing 737-800,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cox's Bazar to Dhaka,December 2018,3,1,,4,5,,False
"""seats were good pitch""",7,2018-12-18,"Dhaka to Cox's Baza. Booked a discounted ticket more than a month ago. Didn't expect too much. Just on time departure & arrival. That's what I got. Boarding & luggage handling was smooth. Cabin crew wasn't exactly cordial, but professional enough. It was a 40min ride, but the captain was able to make it bumpy despite clear weather. Cheese sandwich & cake was good enough for a shorts haul flight like this, but as expected no IFE. Aircraft was manufactured in 2001, so common for local Bangladeshi carriers. But the seats were good pitch even for a Dutch national who flew alongside me & was well over 6'.

"""It got hotter, and hotter""",3,2018-11-25,"As soon as I boarded the plane, it was hot. Air conditioner was not on. It got hotter, and hotter, and hotter inside the plane while all others after me boarded. That process took roughly about 40 minutes for everybody to board. Despite many people trying to cool themselves by fanning newspapers or whatever that were in their hands and requests to the crew to switch on the air conditioner, it was still not switched on. When, finally, the plane started moving, I thought the ac would now be switched on - bot no - they still would not switch it on. The plane spent 20 minutes taxiing on the tarmac before taking off. The air conditioners finally came on about 7 minutes into the flight, for a flight that only lasts 30 minutes. The same thing happened on the return, with no air conditioner on until well into the flight. This is utterly disgusting on the part of Regent Airways. I have flown on this airline before as well, and the same thing happened on those occasions as well. If Regent Airways are reading this, please increase your fares to cover the cost of fuel for keeping the ac on right from the time of boarding to keep passengers comfortable. This is obviously a cost cutting exercise in fuel costs - but this is really disgusting. I am pretty sure all those waving their newspapers and anything else to keep themselves cool would much prefer to pay a few more Taka extra for the ac to be kept on than the terrible experience they get whilst on board your flights.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dhaka to Kolkata ,October 2018,2,2,,2,2,,False

"""our seats were not good""",6,2018-02-24,"Dhaka to Kolkata. We were kept waiting for 15 mins due to their software problems, even in the business class queue. At last, they checked us in under special service from another counter. The flight was delayed by 2.5hrs due to heavy fog that day. But for the business class ticket, we were given a good lounge with premium food and wi-fi. So wasn't much frustrated. We were chauffeured to our aircraft in a 2006 Toyota Axio. But we were a little disappointed as despite for paying for business class, our seats were not good. The galley's wall was in front of us, so we were deprived of a lot of leg room. But suddenly, a passenger fell ill as the plane taxied to the runway for take-off. So the plane had to go back to its initial position, drop off the sick passenger in an ambulance and then returned to the runway, resulting in another 40 min delay. At last, the plane took off. The food quality (snacks), was average. Was served a hot dog, shwarma, and cake. But the seat itself was comfortable beside Window. There was no infotainment system at all, let alone wi-fi.

Worse was when they gave us an meal option to choose between 2 dishes A and B. Me and my wife both chose the same type A. The steward said they ran short of the same type.

We have been inside the terrible plane with horrible experience more than 30 minutes. They were unable to open the door for half an hour.

"""quickly going downhill""",3,2016-10-07,"✅ Verified Review |  Chittagong to Dhaka with Regent Airways. A moderately good airline that is quickly going downhill. I fly the Regent domestic route (Chittagong to Dhaka) 5 to 10 times a year for business and international routes (Dhaka - Bangkok and Dhaka - Kuala Lumpur) typically three times a year. Regent used to be my go-to option to avoid the national joke that is Biman Airlines, but over the past year, Regent's reliability with domestic flights has gone significantly downhill, with consistently late flights and a frequently chaotic check-in process to get a boarding pass. Regent now offers consistent delays of 30 - 90 minutes for a routine daily domestic flight and staff who open the ticketing counter 20 minutes before the flight's takeoff time and then rush passengers along as if it's their fault. Flight delays because of weather or other unavoidable circumstances are understandable, but when it's due to poor planning or airline staff just showing up late, it's absurd.

Regent Airways customer review,6,2014-01-29,I have flown with Regent a couple of times between Dhaka and Chittagong and Cox's Bazar and in general have found them to be OK although the air conditioning on their Dash 8 aircraft frequently doesn't work. However more recently I have twice flown with Regent on their new 737-400 aircraft fro Dhaka to Bangkok. However when they say new this actually means new for them as both aircraft are leased from other airlines and are actually starting to show signs of age. Only one of them has an onboard entertainment system which didn't work when I was on board and the other (seemingly older) aircraft actually still has ash trays in the arm rests which have been taped up to stop people from using them but on a lot of the seats the ash trays have been removed leaving a rather sharp and dangerous metal edge on the end of the arm rest. On my last trip from BK back to Dhaka the Pilot went AWOL and so were almost 2 hours late leaving BK. The meals on board are very typically Bangladesh and not good and of course you cannot get an alcoholic drink on board. The tea and coffee is also pretty bad. The FA's are for the most part friendly enough but efficiency is not their highpoint. However despite their shortcomings their prices are very good.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True
