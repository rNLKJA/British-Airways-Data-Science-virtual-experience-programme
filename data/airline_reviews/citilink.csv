"""best airline on the route""",7,2016-11-05,"✅ Verified Review |  Dili to Denpasar. Citilink has taken over Air Timor's Dili to Denpasar charter and, while not as good as Garuda, they are probably the best airline on the route (probably the most expensive too). They had a shiny A320 but they had packed 31 rows into it and there was no legroom for anyone over 175cm tall. No entertainment but that's ok on a 1.5 hour flight. Staff were quite good, food was ok. Citilink is ranked as a safe airline by our security advisors - possibly just piggybacking on Garuda's rating but I didn't notice any dodgy practices. Gardua's probably trying to position Citilink as the premiere Indonesian regional airline and they seem to be doing pretty well.",False,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DIL to DPS,November 2016,2,4,,3,3,,True,
"""flight attendants were friendly""",7,2016-07-14,"✅ Verified Review |  I flew from Jakarta to Semarang on Citilink. It was a flight near the end of the Ramadhan season, so, it's packed since most of the passengers are traveling to their hometowns to celebrate Lebaran with their families and relatives. The flight was the first flight of Citilink in HLP, which was scheduled to depart at 5:15. I was notified by Citilink to be at the airport 3 hours prior to the scheduled departure to avoid long lines at the airport, which is a bit upsetting since I have to be at the airport by 2:15, only to find the flight itself was delayed for about an hour due to ""operational reason"". Aside from that, the trip was pretty good. The ground staff were quick, but a little more smiling could be better. The flight attendants were friendly, informative, and helpful. The cabin was clean and comfortable. Overall, Citilink is pretty good, and I will fly with them in the future as long as they improve, especially in the ground handling and the punctuality of their schedules.",False,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,HLP to SRG,July 2016,3,5,,2,4,,True,

At around 18.30, I received a text message from Citilink saying that my flight is delayed to 21.50. At the airport, when I asked the staff about the delayed time, they seemed clueless. It was rather confusing, since the boarding pass and information board showed the flight time at 20.05. After not receiving any news from the staff or from the information board, at 21.50 they announced that the flight is being delayed again for another 3 hours.

Booked this airline due to the airport being located in Jakarta city centre - Halim Perdana Kusuma Airport (HLP). Airline changed the departure time without notification, I realized the delay through the web check-in and asked their call centre to confirm it. The check-in process was chaotic as they only have two counters open for 5 different flights. The baggage handling was OK for low cost airlines. The cabin looks good and clean.

"""very pleased and satisfied""",8,2015-11-19,"I flew two routes with Citilink, Jakarta to Padang and Kualanamu to Jakarta in early October and was greatly pleased with the overall experience. The aircraft were in good condition, clean and airy, the flight attendants attentive, kind and professional in their demeanor. Most importantly the product gave the impression of well practiced routine and safety not an unimportant impression for nervous fliers. We were on time on both flights. The for purchase entrees were laughably cheap and in fact more than satisfactory ie. enak sekali! As an aside, their website proved to be the easiest one to navigate of the various Indonesian airlines, permitting trouble free purchase with a US based credit card. The fares were very competitive in fact in most of the routes I comparison shopped Citilink was the cheapest. But it certainly was not the cheapest in terms of product and experience. I do not see much difference with Garuda in terms of the quality, condition and state of the aircraft. Of course Garuda does provide snacks and meals included in the price of fare. I rank Citilink slightly above par with AirAsia and certainly much better than Lion Air. The only drawback vis-a-vis competitor airlines is that the Citilink route network is substantially smaller than Garuda or Lion, flying primarily between Jawa and Sumatera. Hopefully they can add flights to destinations in the Eastern part of the archipelago to give Garuda and Lion a run for their money.

Flight experience was smooth, cabin crew were cheerful and energetic. They started selling selection of food and merchandise right after the seatbelt sign turned off. Attempted to buy coffee and sandwich but both items were not available during the flight. Seats are wide and legrooms are spacious enough for low cost carrier.
