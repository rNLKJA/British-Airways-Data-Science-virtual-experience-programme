"""a great experience""",8,2015-12-30,"Bangalore to Hyderabad. My first time with Air Costa – they been operating as a regional airline India for 2 years. A great experience, the legroom was really good, seats comfortable and the aircraft very new. It's low cost, so besides a glass of water, it costs.
