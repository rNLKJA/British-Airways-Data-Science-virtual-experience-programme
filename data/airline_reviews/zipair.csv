"""I highly recommend ZipAir""",9,2022-11-11,"It was my first time with ZipAir and I was a bit leery of flying so far with a budget airline, but it was an enjoyable experience. Off to a good start, the check-in was fast and efficient. I flew in Standard (economy) class with 3-3-3 seating, which was comfortable with adequate legroom. The basic fare is only for the seat, but I opted for the ""value"" package to get 23 kg checked baggage, seat selection plus a meal (pre-selected from a picture menu) and still saved about $500 over the fares of established airlines. Passengers are required to show their boarding pass during flight to verify the optional upgrade. The tasty meal came in a box on a tray, with just beef and rice next to bottled water. There was no salad, dessert nor other drink, But the free Wi-Fi connected to my smart phone allowed ordering drinks and snacks later, as well as compensating for having no seatback screen. The charming cabin attendants were very safety conscious, double-checking to make sure overhead bins were closed securely. ZipAir should be commended for creating a unique budget flying experience on lengthy international flights. Some earlier negative Skytrax reviews were based on unmet pandemic regulations and refund policies, not the flights themselves, Overall, I highly recommend ZipAir as an alternative to traditional carriers whose fares have skyrocketed on the HNL-NRT route since the pandemic, Just follow the their common sense rules and enjoy the money saved.",True,Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Honolulu to Tokyo Narita,November 2022,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",5,5,,4,True
"""insist I paid for another 23kg of luggage""",5,2022-11-10,"Twenty years in the film distribution business and never once has an airline refused to allow me to hand carry movie posters in a tube until my first flight with Zipair from NRT-SIN on Nov 4th 2022. They said my poster tube exceeded the dimensions of their overhead compartment. They insist that I paid for another 23kg of check-in luggage when my check-in luggage was 19.5kg of 23kg and my hand carry was only 4.5kg of 7kg. It was very clear that they did not want to listen to my explanation that my luggage was under weight and the poster tube weighed under 2kg. They kept saying that it is company policy. The flight was less than 20% occupied. A Very empty flight. The overhead compartment would have easily contained my poster tube with plenty of space to spare. Poster paper measures 27inch width and 39inch height rolled into a poster tube (cardboard) 2 inches longer than the poster's width.  The cabin crew were unsmiling patrolling the aisles like the police. I found them annoying as they made their presence felt, too much and gave out that I am watching you feeling. And it's not like they were giving out water. You have to pay for it. My pre-paid inflight meal was not bad. The expensive wagyu beef bowl is available and they seemed to have stopped selling their normal beef bowl.(minus points here) Purchased a can of Suntory Premium Beer and Pringles. Paid with a credit card but had to type in my details on their tablet. Prices were reasonable but I had to self-type all the cc details, etc for it to happen. Cash is not accepted for inflight sales. Otherwise, the flight was smooth., cabin was clean (hardly any pax) Less rigidity and friendly cabin crew may improve business. Keep your current attitude and Scoot will benefit most with their flexibility and surprisingly professional and charming cabin crew on my SIN-NRT flight on the same trip.

"""had me pay a fee to take the luggage""",1,2022-10-30,"Horrible experience. They say that my luggage is too big for cabin, because it doesn’t fit a small box they had. But inside the airplane there was not only plenty of space but I’ve flown with the same suitcase carry-on for years. So they had me pay a fee to take the luggage to checked baggage. I asked them if they can make it cheaper if I take stuff out. I had 15kg. They said no, 6500 yen is the cheapest. Then I looked on the website and the cheapest was under 14kg with 5500 yen. I came to the airport 3h before departure and waited and waited at the gate. I saw then boarding two other destinations (Singapore and Bangkok) before they started with Los Angeles (my destination). I went there one hour before departure because I was worried. They said that the gates are closed and we can’t het checked in, I said I was there for 3h and not once did I hear them call the LAX flight.  They eventually let all of us in and we managed to get on the plane.  I just wanted the minimum amount of respect and professionalism when dealing with customers. If one of them complains, it’s maybe the customer who’s crazy. But when you have 3 passengers not checked in because they didn’t know where/when to do it, then there must be a problem with your system.  Thirdly, they didn’t offer us water as a free service on a 10h flight. You had to buy it.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo Narita to Los Angeles,October 2022,3,4,,1,1,,,False

"""hoping that he is able to get a refund""",1,2022-09-09,"My son, active duty military, had a connection in LAX to go back to Japan where he is stationed. His connection landed 2 hours prior to his flight on ZIPAIR, he was informed his bag had to be re-checked at their counter prior to going through customs to board his flight. There was no agent at the counter to check his bag or father his required documents, check him in and provide a boarding pass. After multiple conversations with airport help desks and ZIPAIR customer service we ultimately had to book a flight on a different airline in order to get him back to Japan timely. Now we are just hoping that he is able to get a refund from ZIPAIR. I would not recommend using them for any flight but if you do be prepared for pricy inconveniences and no customer service.

In 22 of August I went to a clinic in Singapore and I and my grandchild did the PCR test. In 23 of August in the evening I received a e-mail from Zipair saying that my flight was cancelled. One day before the flight departure. And the next flight available will be only 28 of August (same day that my flight from Emirates will leave Japan). So I had to buy a new ticket that cost four time more from another company and I had to do a new PCR express test that cost me 280SGD per person. Total 560SGD + 2.300SGD for a new ticket.

"""the visa I did not have""",1,2022-07-29,"This is the worst service I have ever received from an airline! I spent more than 1000$ USD on a one way ticket only to find that there was no phone number to verify my flight details/requirements. The Japanese and US embassy claimed that I didn't need a visa for Japan to transfer there as long as my flight was within 24 hours. Since my layover in Tokyo was 6 hours I thought I was in the clear. When I got to my departure airport, Noi Bai Hanoi International Airport, the staff would not let me board my flight. Aside from the visa I did not have, the airport staff claimed I needed a negative PCR test, all for only a 6 hour layover in the same day? I used the online chat feature to chat with what seemed like a robot (programmed in India with barely understandable English) prior to my flight.

"""$300 savings was absolutely not worth it""",1,2022-07-22,"My issues started before we even flew. I recovered from Covid but was still testing positive for over a week. Had to get a letter from the Japanese Consulate. At first Zipair said they don't know if they can accept it and to email a copy in. So I emailed a copy and was told they won't accept it. So I called overseas to their Japan HQ and the people there said ""They might accept it at LAX, try your luck"". No I am not going to try my luck. 12 hours before before my flight was to leave they send me an email saying they can accept the consulate paper. Ridiculous that they are so disorganized. Check-in was easy but their online support said they will add TSA precheck when we check-in. At check-in they refused to do so. On the flight you are only given 1 meal, if you paid in advance and 1 bottle of water - it's barely a snack even to Japanese. You are also given the food 1 hour after boarding so enjoy 10 hours of nothing. You will get no more food, water, etc. If you want anything else you have to order it via your phone connected to their in-flight wifi. I ordered a coffee, cost about $2.50 and was brought in a very small cup.  At least when you order snacks they do come fast. In-flight entertainment didn't exist. The system worked on the ground but the second it was airborne all entertainment didn't work. So bring your own movies and entertainment. The seats were clear and nice.

Zipair did not take responsibility for the passengers and just left everyone to sort themselves out at 5am, even families with small children,  their reply was “oh, there are many hotels in Bangkok”.

"""It was immaculately clean""",6,2022-05-23,"Zipair is JAL’s budget airline. They don’t have classes of travel, you just pick your seat (flat bed, emergency exit etc) and pay accordingly. We usually travel BA or JAL business class. This trip was last minute and JAL business was going to cost $8k. Instead we paid just over $2.5k to fly with Zipair in their fully flat seats. Your ticket includes nothing but 7kg of cabin baggage (and they do weigh rucksacks/handbags etc), a bottle of water and the seat you booked. Check in process was not good. Of course we aren’t used to queuing for check in, but here everyone queues. There is no Advanced Passenger Information loaded, so with covid added the check in process was long. Also both our cabin bags were over 7kg so we had to put a bag in the hold. (You can pay to add a bag to the hold, but you can’t pay for additional cabin baggage. They are strict on weight to the gram). We were also asked if we had a return ticket, which as it was booked at the same time as the outward trip was a bit worrying. Finally because the seat map is misleading we had not booked seats together (eg row 2 does not align across the cabin so although we had seats that were both in row 2, in fact I was sat behind and to the right of my husband. This was pointed out to us at check-in but we weren’t allowed to change our seats despite the fact that there were only 2 other seats taken in the fully flat cabin. Seats must be booked at least 24 hours before check-in and again this is enforced strictly. (We couldn’t even change seats on board although the seat on my husband’s left was free). The fully flat bed was nearly as good as JAL/BA business class (not quite so much storage). Includes reading light, table and some storage space. You can stow your hand baggage under the foot stool for take-off and landing (an improvement on the new BA business class seats). Its quite hard, but otherwise good. It was immaculately clean (again better than BA), cabin crew were excellent and it felt safe. There is no entertainment screen. WiFi is included free of charge, and a (very) small selection of films is available. The fully flat seat has a USB charging point. Fairly basic food and drinks can be bought on board by ordering via your mobile device and QI code. The onboard shop opens about an hour after take-off and closes about an hour before landing. Otherwise meals must be booked in advance. Pre-booked meals are served before the onboard shop is open, so you can’t buy a drink until after your meal. Cushions and blankets are not included, but can be bought from the online shop. In deciding whether to use Zipair you need to compare cost to convenience. If you have time to download movies, book seats in advance (there is no app to make this easy), pre-order meals, and to bring your own pre- and with-meal drinks that will help. Also to bring your own cushion/blanket if you like to sleep as soon as you get on board. For me, some of the joy was missing. There wasn’t enough meal/entertainment/shopping to pass much time for those who are not good at sleeping.
