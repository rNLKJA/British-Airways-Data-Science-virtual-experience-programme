"""asked us to pay for luggage""",1,2019-11-14,"Bangkok to Delhi.  Booked package through Make My Trip and luggage was not included. At the time of airport check-in they asked us to pay for 40 KG of luggage where my luggage was only 18KG. Otherwise, they will not let us travel. So we paid and came back.  Till now refund is not processed after asking so many times.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Delhi,July 2019,1,1,,1,1,,False
"""a good flight""",8,2019-10-20,"Bangkok to Osaka. Smooth check in and efficient seat allocation. They didnâ€™t check cabin baggage weight nor size. Had to buy food and drinks as refused internet preorder because we used a travel agent. Seats ok but a night flight which was very uncomfortable. Saw in the inflight magazine we could upgrade enroute to premium economy - a good idea. For B7,000 a good flight.",True,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Osaka,October 2019,3,3,,5,5,,True
