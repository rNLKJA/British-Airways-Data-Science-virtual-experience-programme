"""No leg room and super hard seats""",2,2022-01-16,"They use a scam payment system for cabin luggage: if it doesn't fit into the tiny box (half of the normal size) you pay 25$ at check-in, but at another mandatory check during boarding it's already 40$. Impossible to check in online unless paying for the seat. No leg room and super hard seats.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Arkhangelsk to St Petersburg,January 2022,1,2,,2,1,,False
"""Avoid flying, unless really necessary""",1,2021-05-30,"Impossible to do online check-in, unless you pay for the seat selection. Ridiculous carry-on limits, what happened to IATA guidelines? Seats have no legroom at all. And can't say the cost was low for a low-cost airline. Avoid flying, unless really necessary.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,St.Petersburg to Kazan,May 2021,1,1,,1,2,,False
"""no service, but cheap ticket""",1,2020-08-19,"First flight was okay, 10kg carry-on, no questions. Small seats, no service, but cheap ticket. Flight back was a disaster, I wasn’t allowed to take the same bag back! Bag should fit in a tiny rack, where even laptop doesn’t fit. At first they tried to scam me into paying €35 for “oversized” carry-on (the ticket cost €42). After one hour of fighting with the staff they found another rule: that laptop can be taken separately. Never again.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class, St. Petersburg to Kazan,August 2020,1,1,,1,2,,False
