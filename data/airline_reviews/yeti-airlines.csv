"""Both the flights were delayed""",2,2022-03-25,"I have been in flight with Yeti Airlines for a couple of time during my stay in Nepal for a month. Both the flights were delayed by couple of hours. I was called at 4:00 pm but the flight took off at 6:00 pm. Similarly the flight at 7:30 is delayed for 9:00 am. This is the worst ever service from a domestic flyer. How could the service delivery of YETI be good, having such poor employees. I will never be flying on Yeti from next time.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kathmandu to Simara,March 2022,4,3,,3,1,,False
"""disappointed by the behaviour of air hostess""",2,2021-10-18,"First of all thanks to the team for on time flight experience. I am deeply disappointed by the behaviour of air hostess. I was traveling with my 4 yr kid who is inquisitive about surroundings so he was standing on the seat to see around, in a minute air hostess came to us and with rude pitch uttered very harsh words to my child  sit down on your seat otherwise i will lock you in the bathroom"". I request the airline to teach their members to behave properly.",True,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kathmandu to Bhairahawa,October 2021,1,1,,1,1,,False
"""the flight was on time""",2,2019-11-26,"Not Verified |  Kathmandu to Bhadrapur. First of all the flight was on time which is good. As I went on board the flight attendant was not pleasant. There was no in flight entertainment just a magazine. The food was not great, we got some sweet which I didn't like personally and a packet of peanuts with water. The flight attendants were very rude as when I asked for the washroom they said in an unpolite and rude way ""The Seat Belt Sign is on be seated"". I didn't notice the sign was on and I asked them. They could have at least said it in a nice way.  The good thing though was that they allow around 20 kg of baggage and a bit excess. I forgot to mention that when I got my boarding pass I gave my skyclub card and they didn't bother to look at it even and they didn't give my sky miles either. I couldn't argue as a huge line was building up and I had to move. One more thing if you are about six feet tall or a bit less than that don't fly with this airline the legroom is very less, I had to squzee my legs and fit it in. After landing it was fine, I collected my bag and was on my way.",False,ATR 72 500,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Kathmandu to Bhadrapur,October 2019,1,1,,1,3,,False
"""I would fly this airline again""",8,2019-01-05,"Pokhara to Kathmandu. I received very good service by Yeti Airlines at Pokhara and Kathmandu airport on 1st Dec 2018. Due to fog, my flight was delayed. I had a connecting flight to Delhi from Kathmandu to Delhi at 1445. The Staff at Pokhara Airport were very helpful to my request to advance my booking to an earlier flight and ensured my luggage was loaded in the cabin itself, so that I could get it first when I landed at Kathmandu. At Kathmandu, the staff unloaded my luggage and took me in the small van to the terminal, so I could leave the airport quickly. I would rate this as excellent service. On my next trek in Nepal, I would fly this airline again.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Pokhara to Kathmandu,December 2018,4,4,,5,5,,True
"""cabin crew was friendly""",8,2016-07-23,"âœ… Verified Review |  I flew Yeti Airlines, June 28 from Bhairahawa ( the airport near Lumbini, the birthplace of Buddha) to the capital Kathmandu. It was a morning flight, on time, the ground staff were friendly, cabin crew was friendly. They served soft drinks on this 35 minute flight. Reading material offered. The jetstream is a turboprop engine aircraft and has seating capacity for 29 person in an 1x2 arrangement The flight was smooth. Yeti Airlines has the reputation of flying on time. Though it's safety record is not very encouraging but has been spotless and blemish free since it separated it's mountains region operations in the name of Tara air as it's subsidiary. Sky miles, their frequent flyer program is very popular and has many other benefits like discounts in hotels, than award tickets. The name Yeti also is an attraction to the visitors.",False,Jetstream J41,Business,Economy Class,BWA to KTM,June 2016,3,5,,4,5,,True
