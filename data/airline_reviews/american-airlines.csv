"""demanding I bag and tag it""",1,2022-11-15,"Most of my grievances are specifically with the Charlotte/Douglas Airport American Airlines employees. The outward bound trip had almost a 3 hour delay getting on our connection flight from there to Nashville ... this was after the first long leg flight from Germany to Charlotte, so we already had a 3 hour layover as we had to customs in NC and collect our bag and bring it for drop off to our connection flight to Nashville. After doing all that we end up being delayed almost 3 hours (so 6 hours total at this Airport). We could have rented a car and driven to Nashville in that timeframe which we would have preferred honestly because then maybe our toddler would have gotten some sleep. Once we finally made it to Nashville the baggage crew had us waiting almost an hour for our bags. Now coming back to Germany trip is where it gets worse. Nashville flight to Charlotte everything was fine with exception the plane we had this time had like micro storage above that no one could fit their carry on bags which caused a lot of bag drop off and pick up at flight gate and of course our travel stroller is the last item that comes out getting off that flight in Charlotte NC to transfer to our connection to Frankfurt Germany. At that gate (D9 specifically) in Charlotte NC is where I was having to deal with the very rude woman at the gate and that's where I'm positive I also ended up leaving behind my brand new jacket while I was being rudely talked down to and ultimately had to just walk away to avoid further confrontation with this American Airlines employee. This all started with boarding the gate when the woman employee requested I fold down my stroller, so she could check its size in the metal carry on baggage thing they have near gate. Ok no problem I'm confident we will not have an issue as it's the same plane we took coming here and I know the travel stroller fits in the overhead with no issues (Joolz Aer -specifically super lightweight and compact for airplane travel). My husband and child continue boarding as we have a carseat to install and need the time to do this, so I'm standing there with my stroller on the measuring thing and it fits perfectly when she started telling me no it's too big and comes right on the max line for size and demanding I bag and tag it. I question her on this and said it was no issue coming here and fit fine to which I'm told, ""I don't care what they let you do on that flight you're not allowed to bring that stroller as a carry on because I say it wont fit and I just told some first class couple the same too about their stroller, so if they can't bring it neither are you!"". OK wow, so I tell her my husband has the travel bag in the carry on suitcase and I need to leave and get on the plane to get it from him and I'll be right back then to which I'm getting all this attitude from her and she began saying things like well that's not my problem I didn't tell him could go ahead and board. I quickly board and get the travel bag from my husband and run back out to the gate entrance to bag and tag the stroller. While doing this I sit down my jacket close by and then become rushed by an different attendant about tagging the bag. I ask her to give me a minute bag it and she sticks on the tag and hands me my receipt and tells me to bring it the gate drop off where I saw someone else leave their stroller near plane entrance.

"""I am extremely unhappy with this entire situation""",1,2022-11-03,"I am writing this review because the experience that I have had with American Airlines in the past two days is honestly unbelievable. My daughter is a minor and was flying back from Anchorage to Myrtle Beach on November 2, 2022. When she arrived at the airport for check in they sent her to the gate with the app on her cell phone for boarding. She is an unaccompanied minor which I paid extra for so you cannot use the app for boarding. That was their first mistake because by the time she went back to the desk she ended up missing her flight. Because of that she did not return to Myrtle Beach when she was supposed to. She had to be put on a flight for the next night which was extremely inconvenient especially because of her school. She then leaves Anchorage on the next flight which was the next night and when she arrives in Dallas she has no unaccompanied minor tag or chaperone. When I find this out I go straight to the Myrtle Beach airport to find out why my child is alone in Dallas. In the process she finds someone and ask about her chaperone and she is told that she is not on a list for a chaperone. A lady sits with her anyway but tells her that she will probably not have a chaperone when she gets to Charlotte. While I am at Myrtle Beach airport I find out that Anchorage airport put my child on the plane and did not list her as an unaccompanied minor so she was not chaperoned. I wasted my entire morning at Myrtle Beach airport trying to make sure that my child was safe and would make it back to Myrtle Beach because she still had another connecting flight.

I am extremely unhappy with this entire situation and I can say that if nothing else the one mistake that an airline should never make is not having a chaperone available for a minor that has three different flights. When booking this flight I was assured multiple times that my child would not be alone and that was not the case. Once again this whole situation has been absolutely unbelievable.

"""civil aviation is no longer civil""",2,2022-11-01,"After 55 years of flying, as my father before me, to every major city in the US and to many countries abroad with over 100 flights annually, I can truely say I have had it with civil aviation. I never want to see another domestic carrier again. DFW/XNA this past Friday was one of the worst on record for me. A 42 minute flight was most deplorable. I have been tied to United, Delta, SW and even TWA, US AIR, Continental over the years until nearly all were absorbed by the Big 3. Now with AA exclusive since 1995. The perpetuated lies from pilots and maintenance personnel is just beyond the pale. It borders on harassment and being taken hostage. Yes the weather at DFW was sketchy on 10/28 but most every flight was moving in and out. I am OK with being delayed 2-3 hours if I am told the truth and updated, but 7 hours is horrid for passengers and AA staff. The lead FA and gate agent were on the verge of panic attacks because of the lies being told. The Captain just gets up and walks out without saying a word for he timed out on his duty hours. The FAs were furious he did this and they were calling their management over it. Secondly, How can a passenger expect they are being told the truth when you are told your aircraft "" has been taken out of service"" by maintenance only to reboard the same aircraft an hour later. I have my suspicions about that sequence of events but to long to go on in this forum. In the end the FAs saved us for they extended their duty hours to get us to XNA, otherwise we were screwed. Every passenger should be grateful to them as I was, even being 7 hours late. I read these comments about AA, it is shameful that a once premier domestic carrier and brand is now rated as a 2 star carrier. Its shameful that AA management does not care one ounce for their staff nor the passengers but only for the stock price of the shareholder. I don't begrudge that but I want reliable service week in and week out when I travel on business and not the ongoing maintenance and operational stupidity that happens almost weekly. The new loyalty program is joke and only rewards those committed to a CC not the AA brand. So when booking AA, roll the dice and take your chances. I would hate to stake my vacation, honeymoon or cruise based on their service level. I doubt you are much better off with SW, Jet Blue, Alaska or United. Maybe Delta is the best bet in todays environment but with their 15,000 pilots threatening strike action I doubt they can be depended on either.

That was all such a stressful situation, and dealing with American to rebook my flight could’ve been one more area of stress, but it wasn’t. And I was so, so thankful. I called later than I was supposed to one of the times because I was driving to the airport to see if maybe I would get my COVID test back in time while driving to the airport to make my flight. I didn’t get the test back in time but didn’t call right away to change my flight because I had a pounding headache that was turning into a migraine and was extremely exhausted.

"""lack care for their customers""",1,2022-10-16,"My husband and I were on flight AA1400 out of Miami today. We were attempting to get to our honeymoon destination in Jamaica. We boarded the flight around 12:10 PM with an expected take off at 12:56 PM. There was light rain that turned into thunderstorms for the first hour of us waiting to take off, delaying our flight. After the first hour it went back to light rain and we noticed several airplanes starting to take off on the runway. After waiting for another hour with minimal updates from the pilot, we were instructed to exit the aircraft. We did as we were told and went to the gate to wait for further instructions. We were informed after about 45 mins minutes that another pilot will be taking over and we were able to re-board the aircraft. The time at re-boarding was approximately 4:30. After another hour of waiting on the now second pilot to take us to our destination, the plane suddenly turned around on the ramp when we were very close to take-off. The plane was taken back to the terminal and all of us passengers were waiting to hear what the delay was this time. Unfortunately for us, there was little communication as to why we could not depart for our destination now 5 hours after our SCHEDULED departure time. I would like to say there was a “vague” explanation but I simply cannot. Even their pilot could not explain why he was not allowed to take us where we paid good money to be. It was at this time we were instructed to de-board the plane a SECOND time. After some talk amongst the flight crew and I suppose them communicating with their outside resources, they informed us of a THIRD pilot who would be boarding and be responsible for taking us to our destination. We FINALLY were able to depart at exactly 7:06PM. We had been on that plane for 7 hours today, just sitting and waiting and left in the dark. The flight crew kindly passed around cookies and one cup of water during our first delay around approximately 2:30. When asked to de-board there was no time for any passengers to stop and eat because we were trying to stay close to be informed on the situation only to re-board and wait an additional 3 hours. There were several small children on this flight as well. AA should be extremely disappointed in how this situation was handled. It was unprofessional and cruel to leave us waiting and waste our time. My husband and I missed our first day at our expensive resort on our first day of our honeymoon. They left children and other passengers crying and hungry. Shame on them. I am not one to leave a bad review or even write an email to this extent (especially on my honeymoon) but given the situation it is much deserved. We tried on our honeymoon to call and get compensation and all we received were two $50 trip vouchers. We will NEVER fly AA again and neither should you.

As with my JFK-ATH flight several weeks earlier the food served was close to inedible. On both flights AA offered a single appetizer of shrimp ... for anyone with allergies to shrimp or religious problems with said shrimp - tough luck. Further to meal service, drinks were served only once, no coffee or tea was ever offered. My Inflight entertainment did not function except for the first hour of the flight. Ninety minutes prior to landing we were told to expect severe turbulence for the next 45 minutes and thus no second meal service. There was not a single bit of turbulence nor a second meal service.

Instead of brushing me aside they were capable, calm, smiling, and gracious to me and to other travelers in line. Everything went smoothly as grace.

There was a 200 person line at the customer service desk with 2 people working so we didn't even bother to try for a hotel or food voucher. The next morning flight got delayed an additional hour, but we finally made it to Lima. Our trip has now ended and we were supposed to be on a morning flight September 11 at 0800 to Dallas, but the flight was delayed 5 times inside of 15 minutes and eventually rescheduled 24 hours after the inital departure time this time due to mechanical issues. The story we got was the issue couldn't be fixed and they were bringing another plane in. Someone else we spoke to said there was a part they couldn't get and didn't know when it would arrive so who knows what the real answer is. No one on the phone for customer service could help us. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours and the best they could offer was a 30 hour travel time with 2 layovers in the opposite direction of where we needed to go only to arrive at the same time as we would if we waited until the next day (today). Just as we were about to leave for the airport this morning 5 texts came in stating the flight was delayed multiple different times. We called customer service who reassured us the flight was still happening and only delayed 20 mins. We got to the airport today and waited in line for 3 hours before receiving a text saying the flight had been canceled, but another scheduled flight to Dallas left on time. Staff directing people to the counter lines refused to give any information and were dismissive of people's concerns. When we got to the ticket counter, we were told all other flight options were already booked and the best they could do was give us a flight on a different carrier at 0100 tomorrow (40 hours after our originally scheduled flight) with an additional 8 hour layover at LAX. They finally booked us with a different carrier and hopefully we will make it home 2 days late. They told us before they weren't obligated to rebook us with any other carrier if the delay was 24 hours or less and that they don't have any other partner airlines they can book with, yet miraculously after the 24 hour mark they can and do book us with someone else. Half of our trip time has been spent traveling and we have lost wages at work, cost of extra hotels, and food. We had a family member with a medical emergency at the end of our trip and were unable to make it home in time before they passed away.

"""extremely rude and unprofessional""",1,2022-08-21,"With a very heavy heart I decided to write this letter to share a long list of mistakes made by American Airlines in our last travel experience. We had no idea how much trouble we would be by trusting a company that seemed just about right at first glance. We are a group of 6 people (3 couples), average ages between 60-70, semi-retired (still working since social security income doesn´t even cover the average expenses) and self-employed. We had been planning this trip for several months since all of us had to close our schedules, save money and make it work according to our budgets. With all the inflation, recession it was already a struggle to make it work for us all. Everything started with our flight from Nashville to Miami being cancelled only 10 hours prior. We depended 100% on that flight to take an International flight to Samana (Dominican Republic) after only 4h layover. American Airlines is the only airline with that destination available and has only 1 flight/week to that location, so losing that flight would literally ruin the whole vacation. Our Resort was already reserved/paid for and could not be cancelled, so a no-show would cost us cancellation fee money as well. Immediately when we were notified that our flight was cancelled we called American Airlines Customer Service, it took nothing less than 1.5h to finally reach a representative and to be honest, she was not helpful at all. One more hour waiting and we finally could talk to a supervisor. She could not rebook us with American Airlines or any other partner so we decided to start searching flights from Atlanta (checking all other airlines) to Miami and ask the supervisor to change our coming back flight (final destination in Atlanta instead of Nashville so we could leave our car there and have a car to drive back home). Two hours later we could get our coming back flights changed with final destination in Atlanta but at that point there were no more flights available from Atlanta to Miami. Back to square one we decided to get us a flight straight to Punta Cana and forget the AA flight to Samana since would be impossible to get there in time even if we decided to drive. I found a flight from Atlanta to Punta Cana (5.5h drive from our Resort) and all of us could get a seat (we purchased from different websites all at once so nobody would be left behind). This flight cost each couple the average amount of $938. We loaded our Van and drove to Atlanta right away ($165.00 paid in gas). I also had to get a parking space for 7 days which cost us total $87.55. We finally flew to Punta Cana and got a 5.5h transfer to Samana, which also cost us the amount of $412.05. After this huge adventure we could make it there 24h later and it was the most stressful and frustrating hours in our lives. But the mistakes kept happening. When we got to El Catey Samana Airport, one of the check-in employees (still being trained) made a mistake: he forgot to print the tickets for the flight from Miami to Atlanta for 2 of us (Mr. Dannie Glover and Mrs. Hope Glover), later on in Miami the lady at the gate was extremely rude and unprofessional (her name is Valentina by the way). Flight to Atlanta was delayed 2 hours and she sent us to Gate D37 (Customer Service) just 5 min before boarding.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nashville to Samana via Miami ,August 2022,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,1,False

 not so much anymore. Flight from MYR to ORD: passengers squeezed like sardines! I’m only 5,5” size 8/10 and I had next to no legroom, no space at all between passengers for elbows.  I can’t imagine if my son 6’ 200lbs off muscles would fit in those seats and that in the times of pandemic!! Pitch to recline virtually nonexistent. To top it off, the flight attendants went on a 5 minute Spiel of credit card selling, afterwards a prerecorded sales pitch, then before deplaning they came around with applications. Did I really pay to be forced to listen to infomercials I couldn’t mute? And in some variations that happened on all 6 flights! The last flight (CLT to MYR), the flight attendants seemed extremely bored/bothered - before deplaning they came with trash bags, not sure what for since there was no snack/drink offered. 
 As I got on my last flight, I overheard a flight attendant thanking the pilot for helping clear up a situation, a passenger to a different destination made it onto that flight… In ORD they took my carryon and said it would be there when I get off the plane, well it wasn’t, on top of that I was rushed off the bridge which meant I couldn’t get my luggage until “everybody” got off the plane and the gate agent went to retrieve it. This gate agent was very rude.  I barely made my connection and didn’t have a chance to pick up dinner until I got home. Lastly, the app is useless and only worked on 2 off 6 flights, couldn’t check in or get boarding passes on it! Couldn’t connect to in flight entertainment/wifi, not sure why, not that I could’ve used it since you need the old plug in headphones.

Apparently when the first delay was announced just moments before boarding, American wasn't aware of where there plane was? So we were told to go to rebooking again to wait another hour and a half in line to be told we couldn't get a connection from Philadelphia to Manchester until 2 pm the next day and were provide courtesy of American Airlines a night stay at the roach bag hotel which upon looking up the hotel to ensure it wasn't at such a distance as our previous courtesy hotel, saw the atrocious reviews.

I believe that that second we got off our original plane they knew we would not be taking off. When looking out the window at the second plane you could see nothing was being done to the plane, no luggage being moved, no refueling, and no maintenance being done. They gave us a $12 meal voucher as an apology, but at 10pm at night most of the places to eat were closed. The line to rebook took us 2 hours to get through, we were toward the front. The flight they were able to rebook us on was a total of 21 hours due to long layovers.

The only reason we bought them was because they were the only airline going to Kentucky during the time we needed to be there. My husband and I have said that if that’s the case in the future, and AA is the only one going, we won’t be going to the event and will happily miss it to avoid ever giving this company our money or time in the future. A couple of weeks before our flight they emailed saying our first layover went from two hours to 6 hours. On the first flight, the flight attendant was very rude. She told me I had to put my carry on in the overhead bin. I explained that it was made to fit under the seat, but she told me it needs to go above. I started getting it ready to put it up there and she shut the door on the overhead before I could stow it and walked away… ok, so I put it under the seat. And it fit perfectly fine, just like it has on so many flights before. I had a cup with water and ice that I was finished with and asked her if she could throw it away for me. She said no!  I couldn’t believe it. I put the cup in the seat in front of me. I fell asleep, we were on a red eye flight. The cup ended up spilling and got all over myself and my husband. Our flight on the way home was delayed, so we ended up missing our connecting flight. They only let us know that 1 1/2 hours before the flight. We could have stayed with our friend if we had had a heads up. Instead of sitting at the airport for 20 hours. We were told they put us on the 8am flight, with 2 stops before we got home. But turns out we weren’t .. we were on the 8pm flight. They put us in a hotel which was kind of helpful. We decided to go with another airline to get home the next morning. When I went to the ticket counter to tell them to cancel our flight she informed us she could get us on standby at 9:30, or regular booking at 11:30. Both have now been delayed. They’ve already told me they don’t know where my bag is and will call us when it arrives in SLC. I called to express my frustration with the airline and see what was going on, and why so many problems. The manager didn’t care at all. She didn’t even say sorry for the inconvenience. She was completely monotone and said they would not do anything to compensate me since I still took the flight. I usually don’t write reviews, or complain about employees, this is only the 2nd review/complaint I’ve ever written. But I felt it necessary because of the horrendous experience we have had. I want to warn others about this airline and save them from having the experience we’ve had. Needless to say we are delusional and exhausted from the run around, changing of gates, times etc. We could have driven home faster, and I’m fully regretting not doing that at this point. Save your time, money and sanity and do not book with AA. And btw, we had three friends fly out of Kentucky with AA this weekend and they all had similar experiences.

You think stand by was going to happen for everyone? NO.) so I ask the worker to put me on standby or what my options were to get home sooner.

Cancel my flight now and I will book a rental for tomorrow morning.” I then asked him “what about a hotel, are you guys going to pay to put me in a hotel tonight?” He said “AA will be sending you a link for some hotel choices to book and be covered under them.” I received the link, they gave 3 hotel options. All of these hotels were sold out before even getting the link. I showed him and he said “pick a hotel and AA will reimburse you $125 for a hotel, just save all of your receipts and send everything in. I booked the hotel, he gave me vouchers for the taxi.

"""recommendation is never use American Airlines""",1,2022-05-08,"Not Verified |  A summation of incompetence by American Airlines. My family and I made the horrible mistake of flying to Hawaii on American Airlines on 4/13/2022 or we were supposed. When we tried to start our flight, American Airlines had understaffed their ticket desk at the airport. Two ticket agents were trying to handle three flights worth for passengers. Multiple of the automatic ticket machines were broken or out of paper. By the time we got through the line to check our bags our flight had already left. So, the ticket agents booked us for 4/14/2022. We went home, repacked so we did not need to use checked bags and waited for next day. 4/14/2022 we get through TSA and board our flight to Chicago. The flight was delayed because of a ‘mechanical problem’ whatever that means. We arrive in Chicago, have our lay over and then get on our flight for Dallas-Fort-Worth. Again there is a delay because of ‘mechanical problems. This delay was much worse and by the time we landed in Dallas our connecting flight to Hawaii had already left. There are no more flights out of Dallas that day to Hawaii and we are stuck. American Airlines handed us coupons for food, $12 a head and for a stay at a nearby days in. Family and I head to our hotel and spend the night. On 4/15/2022 in the hotel shuttle going back to the Dallas-Fort-Worth airport I ask the driver if they know much about these hotel coupons we got from American. Drive claimed that for last 11 months American had been sending 25 to 50 people a day to their hotel that had been marooned in Dallas of problems like ours. I have no way to confirm the drivers claim, but it sounds true to me. Once on our flight to Hawaii the plane has backed away from the jet way and the pilot comes on. There will be a delay departing because of… “mechanical problems”. Three flights and each one had mechanical problems.  Clearly, they are short staffed, not just the ticket agents but also, I am guessing the mechanics. Again, three different airplanes and each one was delayed with mechanical problems. The only reason my family vacation was not totally ruined is we scheduled extra time off on the front of the trip to spend in Oahu. That and I have travel insurance for our hotel stay on Oahu and that allowed me to get a refund for the missed nights and shore excursions. In the end we were able to make our scheduled cruise that departed on Saturday the 16th. My request to American for a refund got me an offer of $50 a head in vouchers and in the hope of, “rebuilding your confidence with American Airlines, and hope you'll give us the opportunity to provide you with a more positive experience in the future.""

"""the worst of all""",1,2022-04-30,"Not Verified | London to San Jose via New York JFK. Do not fly American - we've flown on some poor airlines in the past, but American has to be the worst of all. Too many examples of poor customer service to list here but some highlights include: Check in: I don't begrudge anyone who is willing to spend the extra for first or business class although if you are thinking about it, I wouldn't with this airline but AA should really have a priority check queue especially for those passengers, they shouldn't allow the “priority passengers” just to walk to the front of the economy queue as they arrive leaving the ""lower classes"" including many families that have been standing at the front of the queue for an hour watching on!! You can't imagine how frustrating this was and how irate the other passengers were getting - there was nearly an uprising! Seating: even though you might think that you as a family have seats booked together and this is clearly shown on the plan of the plane on the AA website - don't rely on this, the check in staff think otherwise and will place you in random places on the plane when you arrive at the airport - we as a family of four were split up on all of our flights, on one particular flight it would seem that the rows of empty seats at the back were required for the cabin crew who needed 3 each to sprawl across whilst having soft drinks and pretzels and watching their iPads, the cabin crew are obviously overworked and need time to relax! The cabin crew aren't very accommodating at resolving these sort of issues and you just have to get on with it. Cancelled flights - our flight out of JFK to San Jose was cancelled meaning we missed a day of our holiday, no help was forthcoming as the ground staff basically couldn't be bothered, better airlines got passengers hotel rooms and gave meal vouchers but not American! I know this as we met several other passengers in our hotel in one of the less than pleasant ends of JFK airport, (Probably one of the last ones available as the better ones obviously booked out by the better airlines that care about customer service) We had to ask our travel agent to find a flight for AA to book us on to the next day, aa Ground staff weren't keen to help us out with this and acted like they had done us a big favour! Air Traffic control congestion is the lame excuse that has been offered as a reason for the cancelled flight but I don’t see how this can be an unforeseen event as they must operate the same schedule on a regular basis and the other airlines with a similar issue were obviously more accommodating to their customers, needless to say compensation hasn’t been forthcoming. From what I’ve read on here cancelling flights is all too common for AA so I guess you just have to book and cling on to some sort of hope that you might reach your destination on at some point. Baggage: Very mixed messages about this from AA, on our outbound flight, check in staff at Heathrow said that our bags would transit through JFK to our final destination of San Jose and we wouldn't see them but I think it's a bit of a gamble! As our outbound connecting flight was cancelled our bags had been dumped off the carousel and were waiting for us at JFK (and were waiting for us for quite some time as we stood in massive queues due to very limited staff at immigration and quite a lengthy process to gain entry in a country that we weren't even technically visiting) On our return journey we were told that our bags would go straight through to our final destina",False,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to San Jose via New York JFK,April 2022,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",1,1,,1,False

"""Give us our money back""",1,2022-04-27,"Not Verified |  I go into this review understanding this has been a doozy of a year for the industry but never in my life have I experienced this. A girl friend and I were able to get a last minute ticket to Florida from Phoenix. We had a connecting flight in Houston (getting in at 11.30pm on Thursday) with our final flight to Miami the next morning, Friday, at 7.20am. We get into an extremely empty airport and look up at the board to check our morning flight to find it cancelled, they sent us an email that this connecting flight was cancelled 8.02 while we were already in the air. We find someone still working and ask about another flight, he was so dismissive. He literally waved us away while telling us that our app would have more options than his computer and said this while walking away into a terminal door. We had no idea if he was coming back. When he did, someone else was there and the original guy finally took interest in helping us. We knew this wasn’t his fault but we are two young moms away from our families for the first time now stranded in a different state. He said he could offer a hotel but that it “wouldn’t be the nicest”, even though there was a hotel in the airport but he said he had no access to it, oh and that the transport ended at midnight so we’d have to hurry (literally would give us only 10min to get out of the entire airport). He then offered to put us on standby for a flight the following morning, Friday, at 5am and then booked us a flight at 6pm in case we couldn’t get on the morning flight (missing half our trip but at this point something was better than nothing). After an extremely glamorous stay in the empty terminal we woke the next morning and checked our app only to see that he had booked us for 6pm the following day, Saturday. There was at least 15 other people on standby for the flight so we didn’t get on, effectively ending our attempts to get to Miami. The entire time they said it was cancelled because of a domino affect caused by weather, there was multiple people from our group already there sending us videos of clear skies. Three other people from three different locations were all able to get to Miami just fine and to add salt to the wound, exactly 10min after our original cancelled flight, another airline to Miami left right on time from the same terminal. When we finally got on a plane back home (after spending 15 hours in the airport), I was getting leaked on by, what I assume, a weird condensation build up in the window when we were descending, it wasn’t just a drip, it was a lot. So when we landed I told the stewardess, just to let them know in case something was wrong and she said “well do you want a napkin or something? There’s nothing I can do about it” I’m an overly polite person and I just can’t get over how rudely we were treated, constantly. We were told to call for refunds once we were officially home and when we finally did, I did talk to an extremely nice gentleman but was told that we may just get a ticket voucher, even though we also paid an additional insurance fee. We are still waiting to hear back (via phone or email we were told) almost two weeks later and my friend checked online to see the status and it was denied but when you click to go further into the site, it still shows a weird pending but of only $125, the ticket was $638.

"""So disorganized, insulting and distasteful customer service""",1,2022-04-26,"Not Verified |  To begin, I booked our flight to Tampa from Phoenix in January. Paid extra to have a direct flight home from Tampa to Phoenix. In February American took it upon themselves to not only delay our flight to Tampa but also add a layover in Dallas on the way home. Now I was obviously annoyed but chose not to complain at that time as it wasn’t a huge deal. Well cut to the layover as we are waiting to get on our flight home the weather in Dallas is beginning to rain and our flight gets delayed 3 times then cancelled entirely. We rebook one immediately for 3 hours later than our original flight, then that flight gets delayed 3 more times. All while tons of flights at the airport are being cancelled and the bad weather is scheduled for another 6 hours I expected that our rebooked flight would likely be cancelled as well and the customer service line already had at least over 300 people in it so we got in line to speak to someone regarding what the next step was if this flight got cancelled as well since that one was at 11pm and I didn’t plan to sleep at the airport. Meanwhile the airport employees are referring us to call the customer service line so I called them while we waited in line. Spoke to a staff member who was very polite and understanding but didn’t have a resolution for me so I held for over 2 hours to speak to her supervisor. After hours in the line we made it to the front and the lady was less than helpful and completely rude. Her resolution was that she could cancel the flight we had re-booked and rebook us at the earliest 9pm the following day with no accommodations because it was “weather related”. I again explained that we were not supposed to have this layover to begin with. Her resolution to that rather than admitting that that is poor customer service on Americans part was that I should have complained when it was changed. So me being nice and letting that slide was now my fault so you’re encouraging that I complain in advance next time? She then said I was being disrespectful and asked me what I wanted from her. I simply explained that I wanted accommodations if the rebooked flight was cancelled. She told me I would have to get back in line (the line that now has well over 800 people in it) when that flight was cancelled. I asked her to just place a note in my file that we had waited 3 hours in the line already and that we were requesting a hotel accommodation if the flight was cancelled. She said a note isn’t going to do anything everyone else is waiting too and slid me back my ticket and called up the next customer. The other party that was with us was asking the other attendant for the same thing and the lady got extremely hostile and defensive and said “Are you trying to fight me?” None of us were being hostile towards them so for an employee to speak to a customer in that manner is completely unprofessional. Cut to after we left the counter with no resolution I finally got a supervisor on the line and she was very polite and willing to hear me out but unable to help me either. Then we finally get on the rebooked flight, just thankful that it wasn’t cancelled at this point then get on the tarmac and have to sit there for over an hour behind 15 other planes and then they lost our luggage to top it off which also happened at the DFW airport the last time we had a lay over there too.

We left for the airport only to find it was actually going to be on time. So we were 5 hours early. They additionally booked our connector with 40 min to make it through customs, baggage pickup, baggage recheck and across DFW. We missed the flight by less than a min, they had just shut the doors even though they verified we were on our way. The attendant told me, ""We have a choice to wait or not - we didn't."" We then went to customer service, who booked us a flight to LAX with a 9-hour layover to connect to Reno. They additionally put us in a hotel. Upon landing we found out the hotel was 36 miles away without a shuttle. When I asked for a different hotel voucher, the attendant found one next to the airport. We walked back to the shuttle line and I thought maybe I should check the hotel. Upon calling I found out they had been sending people away for 2 hours because they were full. I went back to the counter, who found another hotel with a vacancy. We slept for 4 hours in the room stinking of marijuana, woke up to take showers, bought some bathroom necessities and donned the clothes we'd been traveling in for the previous day.

There needs to be an option for families to sit together without having to pay more money for seats - and this is especially true for arranging seats with children. In fact, at the airport, another family approached the desk with the same issue - a parent being separated from their child. We don't expect special treatment, we want to be able to sit next to our child on the airplane! Whatever system American uses to plug people into seats is completely insufficient.

When we purchased our seats, we chose 2 & 2 so there was 1 parent with 1 child. However, when we checked in, we were separated from our children. First, we tried the online chat, that person merely told us our assigned seats, which we already knew since that was what we were calling about. Then we called the customer service line and were told we had to talk to the person at the airport. When we arrived at the airport, we checked our bag through and our passports were scanned. We were not given paper tickets nor told we needed them AND were told we needed to speak to the person at the gate about our seats. We waited and waited for gate personnel. When they finally arrived they just started boarding. We finally got to the front of the line and were told “5 yr olds can sit alone.” This is unacceptable. They expect and think it’s ok for a child in kindergarten to sit next to a complete stranger. Then as we were boarding we were told our passports were not “verified.” Ummm, what? YOU scanned them! Such incompetence is astounding. If I practiced with such incompetence in my job, people would die. Once on board, every single family was separated from each other. It was pure chaos as people attempted to make seat switches. It was like a jigsaw puzzle with missing pieces.

I was coming back from Hawaii on April 2, 2022 - April 3, 2022, after releasing all of the stressors the world is throwing at me, I received all of them back with a snap of a finger. Still in recovery from a surgery, as well as other conditions that has deemed me permanently disabled, I requested a seat with more room to be able to move around and/or stand when necessary. I attempted to do so on my reservation by online, 800#, ticket agents, supervisors, and gate attendants. Everyone up to the gate attendants said ""we have no control over seating until you get to the actual gate for that flight"". Once I get to that gate, waiting in line for 45 minutes, the attendant seemed so overwhelmed and uninterested in my situation that I was cut off mid-sentence with ""we don't upgrade anybody unless you pay for a seat"". Now they are calling my name for pre-loading over the intercom, there are 30+ more people behind me, and the flight is boarding...I either pay the money or be uncomfortable. So I say ""fine, upgrade me"", thinking I will just have to be very frugal this month after spending $150 for leg room. Then she says ""sorry, it looks like somebody already took that seat"" while shrugging her shoulders. As if that isn't enough, when I arrive at my layover, there were no wheelchairs waiting for me or the other 6-7 people whom requested it and when 3 wheelchairs did come, the gate representatives made the decision on who gets a wheelchair versus who rides the handicap cart...I had to ride the cart. We went all the way through the airport, then was told I had to get off to go up the elevator to take another one. That driver literally gets in your face and stares at you until you give him money, then will take 2 steps back. I get on the next cart, same thing! 3 carts later, I am dropped off at the wrong gate.

The plane was missing a part and instead of letting us stay in the airport, we all almost overheated on an airplane. Due to their delay, we barely made it through customs when arriving to the US, ran across the airport, and almost missed our second flight. Oh by the way, they lost my bag. Somehow I got on my plane and my bag didn’t. I have traveled for most of my life to all different states and countries, and including on many budget airlines, and I have never been so  annoyed at an airline. And this was the second time I almost missed flight because my initial flight to Mexico was delayed by two hours and I found myself running across the same airport to catch the connecting because American did not give us enough time to actually transfer. Day 2: American outsources their luggage to other contractors. They gave me one file number at the airport. The company gave me another. The outsourced website says that my bag would have been delivered by 7 pm and it is 9 pm now. There is no number or any sort of contact information. I called American, was on hold for 30 mins for an answer of it’s the company’s job to update the website and they do not have any contact information on file. So I have to put in the work when they lost my bag in the first place. I called the outsourced company and it went to voicemail, even though they said they were open until 10.

The Platinum Pro / Sapphire phone-in number has a typical wait time of 3 to 4 hours, and then you get an agent with an Indian dialect that does not know how to navigate the Sabre system - so American has outsourced this service to India and I assume laid off the well trained U.S. agents we used to enjoy.

I have NEVER had even an above average flight with AA & have been flying domestically & internationally since I was 20 & have no idea how many times I have flown with AA during that time but it has been at least a dozen or two times or more.

My flight was set to leave Saturday evening and was canceled at last minute due to “bad weather” even though it was sunny and nice out. Not to mention, I could see online that TONS of other flights, including those that departed after mine was scheduled to take off, were landing at DCA just fine. The clerk herself admitted that it did not make sense. The experience, however, only got worse… Everyone on my flight waited for hours at customer service for a resolution only to be told that we couldn’t get on another flight until Tuesday. The airline refused to offer a hotel discount, airline credit, or refund to anyone. Even though we were now stuck in Nashville for three days. When I found out I could be put on standby at 6 am the next morning, I asked and they wouldn’t even allow me to have a lounge pass so I could wait at the airport. I was then told the flight the next morning was overbooked by 10 people and standby was essentially pointless for me. While waiting in line at customer service, there was a gentleman in front of me who was traveling with his wife and baby. Again, the airline refused to offer him a discount for a hotel, a refund or credit. The man (who was a black man —coincidence? I’ll let you decide.) never once raised his voice or got aggressive. He simply pleaded for the airline to do something to help him and his family. Instead the attendant got angry at him and yelled at him that he had two options “book a different airline or take the Tuesday flight. Do you want us to risk your life flying in bad weather?!” Very unprofessional. The man in front of me then frustratingly walked away and the airline called the police on him to have him arrested. Unbelievable. The flight attendant said he had been working since 4 am and was too tired for this. Thankfully, my mother was able to speak to the police and calm down the situation so that they understood the customer did nothing wrong. When it was my turn to speak with an agent, I was met with inconsiderate agents who kept saying they just wanted to walk away or tell everyone to go away because this was frustrating for them too. I agree, it was a stressful situation for everyone involved. However, it is unprofessional and extremely inconsiderate to say that to passengers who are now having to book an extra 3 night stay over the weekend in Nashville where the minimum is a couple hundred a night for a room.

We later realize that the agent starts giving away seats to customers flying solo as they become available instead of following protocol (wait until all paying customers are checked in and then go down the standby list in order - we were the top 3 on the list). We ask her why and she says because they are in a rush and need to board the plane. That they cannot afford to wait for 3 seats to open up, they must give them away asap. Although 3 seats eventually became available, because the agent failed to follow protocol, we didn’t make the flight.  We return to the original check in agent and explain what happened. She was confused and confirmed that the staff person did not follow proper standby protocol. She rebooks us for the following day on Wednesday morning but cannot sit us together. I ask her about hotel and meal vouchers and she said she cannot do anything and for us to file a complaint. Yet another night at a hotel, missing work, school, and meal expenses. We arrive at the airport two hours early on the day of our flight so that we can speak to the agent at the counter about sitting us next to our two year old son. The agent says they cannot do anything for us and to “figure it out” when we board the plane with other passengers. We were so distraught by their refusal to help us that two passengers then volunteered to move so that we can be seated with our 2 year old. It was only at that point that Victor (the agent at the counter who refused to help us) then proceeded to change our seats. AA doesn’t care about families. AA doesn’t care about customers. All they care about is their bottom line $$$.

Tina, Nicole, and I began our day yesterday morning by getting ourselves to the Asheville Airport for our two legged trip to Las Vegas and then driving to Zion National Park for our son, Bryson's, wedding this morning! When we arrived at the Asheville desk of American Airlines, we were told that our flight to Charlotte was running late, but not to worry, we would arrive in plenty of time for our connection to Las Vegas. As that flight became later, we were informed by the tickets agent at the gate that we were not going to make our connection. American had two more flights yesterday from Charlotte to Vegas and she said that we were in the numbers one, two, and three spots on stand by. She then stated with all of the delays they were experiencing in the system, we were a shoe in for the next flight. We decided to go ahead on to Charlotte and wait for the next flight four hours later. Well, that flight was over sold and we didn’t get on that flight. The next flight was two hours later and we were met with the same fate on that one, a no go! When confronting American Airlines service, informing them that we have now missed our sons wedding, and we are in Charlotte, where we don’t live, they simply throw their hands up and tell us that we’re on our own from here! To make things even more difficult, we wait around for over two hours trying to recover our luggage. That too was a failed effort and our luggage as of this morning is still somewhere in the American Airlines system between Charlotte and Las Vegas? We had to rent a car, drive home and get here at 1.30am. We will complete the drive to Asheville this morning to go and retrieve our car, and the family of the groom will miss the wedding. The most aggravating factor is, as we found out, our original flight from Charlotte to Vegas was delayed as well and we probably did arrive in Charlotte in time to make that flight. It is my belief that the flight was over sold and they chose not to inform us that we were going to make the flight so that they could accommodate other passengers that were waiting for that over sold flight as well. Instead of asking for us to volunteer to step off, and because we were in Asheville, they just didn’t tell us the flight from Charlotte to Vegas was delayed as well and we were going to make it!

"""absolute disaster that is American Airlines""",1,2022-02-09,"Not Verified | I fly a lot. I’ve flown 3-5 times a year domestically and internationally for most of my life. I’ve had many horrible experiences with planes - delays, cancelled flights, etc. But, I’ve never experienced the absolute disaster that is American Airlines. It’s not the service. It’s the physical planes. My first flight COU to IAH was delayed due to mechanical issues (which they blamed on cold weather which the pilot told us wasn’t true- disgusting behavior by the airline). We were strung along for several hours that a rescue plane was coming. By the time they said we should rebook, all the decent flights were no longer an option. I would’ve had to fly to Dallas late then Houston the next morning. Family ended up driving 4 hours to pick me up because the airline wouldn’t give me a hotel voucher. I flew out of COU 13 hours late (the plane I was rebooked on was delayed as well). Flying home, I left from BTR and that flight was also delayed due to mechanical issues. We left 5 hours late. I missed my connection to COU, so was stuck in Dallas for 10 hours waiting for my flight. No food vouchers of course because it ‘wasn’t their fault’. My plane to COU was then delayed again. I didn’t get home until we’ll after 1am. I was supposed to be home before noon. I had to be up for work at 4am. Zero apologizes from the airline besides ‘sorry for the inconvenience but maintenance isn’t our problem’. Yes maintenance is your problem. The number of planes with mechanical issues I had makes me very reluctant to ever fly with this airline again. They can’t maintain their planes. They don’t notice issues until their passengers are about to board- and these are first flight of the day planes too. There’s plenty of time to check the plane after a flight to be ready for the next day. In my line of work, not checking your equipment would lead to people being fired. Maybe that needs to start happening in aviation. It’s not hard to check the plane after a flight. And if your planes are breaking down this frequently, maybe there’s a bigger problem. Also the complete lack of support for passengers being stranded (many people I flew with were forced to get hotel rooms and the airline offered zero help) is appalling. I’m in the service industry.

We were told to proceed to the desk for rebooting. After waiting in line for 2 hours we were given the only flight they could give us 2 days later and given meal vouchers, hotel vouchers and 2 cab vouchers. We got to the hotel and felt that maybe things would be ok. In the morning we went down to eat breakfast and were told that our meal vouchers were being declined. There were several people in the restaurant having the very same problem. We had to pay $30 out of own pocket for the worst breakfast ever since we had no car to go elsewhere. Next we tried to book a cab for the morning of our rescheduled flight and the voucher we were given was only good for 24 hours and they knew full well when giving it to us that we were delayed for 2 days. We then were forced to pay another fifty dollars for the cab for the airport after having to buy our own meals for 2 days.

"""little interest in the customer""",3,2022-02-06,"Not Verified |  This review refers more to American's refund policy than the actual flight I took. I find it an airline like most of the rest with little interest in the customer. No better, no worse than the other major US airlines. I do find their $60 fee for first bag excessive. Because of covid the airlines are trying to attract customers by offering lenient cancellation terms. I want people to know that American's terms include the following as I recently had to cancel a trip due to covid. This is what I found in my particular case, but I suggest any flyer should check their situation before booking. 1) The cancellation fee in my situation was $200 per ticket. This can add up if you are flying with multiple people. 2) I had the option to change my dates at no charge, but if you booked at a higher rate, you get no refund if your follow up trip is less. 3) You can get a voucher towards future travel (as they call it) implying that you have the full fare to use as you want. Your travel must be completed prior to the date you originally purchases the tickets. So in other words, if you purchased your Christmas tickets early say, July and you cancel. You have to complete our trip prior to July in order to use the voucher. It should, be like for like, either you book within one year of your original booking date or you need to complete travel by the end date of the cancelled reservation. 4) In addition to this restriction the small print tells you that this voucher is only good for one trip and only for the original passengers. So if you had a trip to Europe scheduled for $2000 for you and your husband and you want to fly with your daughter to visit another daughter in the US. You would need to pay for your daughter's ticket and you would lose the balance of the voucher which will probably be in excess of $1000.

"""truly first class experience""",10,2022-01-27,"Flying American's Flagship First is the best end-to-end experience on offer by any US airline. They are the only US-based carrier flying 3 and 4 cabin aircraft with a true first class, and the only one offering a premium ground experience and first class lounge. The experience can vary widely from one crew to another, but I'm generally pleased more often than not. For this flight, I was staying at the TWA Hotel at JFK's Terminal 5, just a short walk and ride on the AirTrain from American's location in Terminal 8. I headed to the terminal about 2.5 hours before boarding to enjoy the lounges and get a bite to eat. I skipped the dedicated First Class check-in counter at Terminal 8 since I already held my boarding pass and was not checking bags. There was no line for PreCheck, and within 5 minutes of arriving at the terminal, I was airside and in the elevator to the Admirals Club in Concourse B, which is home to the Flagship Lounge and Flagship First Dining facilities. I was greeted by the lounge attendant and immediately invited to follow her to the Flagship First dining room, which is within the Flagship Lounge, within the Admirals Club. A lounge, within a lounge, within a lounge - a third-level of exclusivity, which is pretty cool and unique among US-based airlines. I was seated and handed an a la carte food menu and wine list, both of which were quite impressive. The food was outstanding, as was the wine selection on offer, including Laurent-Perrier Grans Siecle Champagne (retails at $160/bottle). Approximately 10 minutes before boarding, I headed to the C Concourse and arrived at the gate about 5 minutes after boarding started to find that they had most of the passengers already onboard this half-empty flight. I arrived at my seat, 2F, finding two pillows, a duvet, and blanket, along with a bottle of water and a basic Shinola branded amenity kit. Immediately upon settling in, a very kind flight attendant handed me a pair of Bang and Olufsen noise canceling headphones and took my order for a pre-departure drink (yes, this is still on offer in F cabin, even during service reductions for COVID) - I naturally chose the Champagne, which was not on par with that served in the Flagship First dining room, but still very good. The first class seat itself on the A321T is one of the best seats on any American aircraft, and is a modification of the seat in the business cabin on their 777-300ER fleet. It is a reverse-herringbone 1-1 layout across five rows for a total of ten seats in the cabin. The opportunity to fly in a reverse-herringbone seat on a narrowbody aircraft is such a great experience, and the most exclusive-feeling cabin you can find. The fact that this route serves a lot of NBC Universal traffic only adds to that experience, as many passengers in F cabin are A list celebrities. The flight attendant working F on this flight was very friendly and attentive, keeping glasses full and passengers feeling like they are truly traveling in a premium cabin. The food was again restaurant-quality, with first courses being served separately from the main course. As an aside, AA was supposed to be implementing ""reduced"" service in all cabins due to the Omicron surge, however, that was definitively not the experience on this flight. Bravo to American Airlines for keeping the product and level of service outstanding, and a truly first class experience.",True,A321,Business,Business Class,New York JFK to Los Angeles,January 2022,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",5,5,,5,True
"""another very good flight""",10,2022-01-26,"SFO-JFK in January 2022. AA operates 16 A321 Transcontinental aircraft with a premium configuration including 10 seats in the F cabin which stand up to the best international business class seats currently flying, and 20 seats in the J cabin in a 2-2 layout with ample space and fully lie-flat. This review is of the J cabin. The only drawback to SFO is that it lacks a Flagship Lounge or any first-class check-in facilities. I was able to access the Alaska lounge in Terminal 2 because I arrived on a United flight, which connects to T2 from T3. I had to take the AirTrain to Terminal 1. All that said, American's ownership of the B gates at SFO is a really nice upgrade over their previous location in Terminal 2, which was itself a very nice terminal. The Admirals Club at SFO is among the cleanest and newest among the network and stands up to those at JFK, ORD, and the best at DFW, and far better than those at PHX, DCA, and most at CLT and LAX. The Harvey Milk Terminal is a beautiful point of departure and among the very best in the entire AA network. Purchased an economy ticket and was upgraded as an Executive Platinum member. Ground and cabin crew on American are traditional and business-like, often with few pleasantries, but usually efficient.  This flight was no exception. Roughly 10 minutes after departure, hot towels were offered, followed by drink orders. Two minutes later I received warm nuts and a glass of very drinkable champagne. My appetizer arrived approximately 25 minutes after takeoff, consisting of an arugula and strawberry salad and tomato and mozzarella salad. It was very edible but could have been served as a single dish. The flight attendant waited until I had finished my first course then brought my main - sea bass, which was truly restaurant-quality. A glass of South African Viognier to accompany the bass. A caramel sundae and Desorono to cap off the meal, followed by coffee. Perfect. Another few drinks, a cookie, a couple hours of work later and it's time to descend to JFK.

"""really do not like flying American Airlines""",2,2022-01-25,"Connecting flight from Alaska Airlines, which is partnered with American. Alaska arranged this flight for me. I had checked in online with both Alaska and American 24 hours prior. I had printed my boarding passes and baggage ticket from kiosk in Santa Rosa airport. When I get to Los Angeles, and go to American Eagle gate, I am told the boarding pass was not the right pass. I was then asked for my passport, as I was listed as an 'international traveler', for no apparent reason. I explained I did not have my passport, that I had not flown outside the country. I was then asked where I was flying from Denver, and I explained Denver was my home destination. This required multiple conferences with their co-worker, and a few phone calls. Finally allowed on plane for my first class seat, one of the last to board. This was a needless delay, and made no sense to anyone. Not only that, but my suitcase did not transfer even though the baggage ticket plainly stated it was to go to Los Angeles and then to Denver. It stayed in Los Angeles, and has been to North Carolina and back in the past day. Very bad connecting flight experience, I wish Alaska did not partner with American. Also, other minor annoyances; when I arrived at the first gate for transfer to American Eagle, I was not aware the doors would open and I would be herded on to a bus, even though I had gone to the counter agent earlier to make sure I was at the correct gate. It's not a problem if only someone there had mentioned to me the routine. As it was, I was confused and inwardly doubting I was in the right area as everyone else on the bus seemed to be going to Portland. A simple explanation would have gone a long way with me late at night in an unfamiliar setting. Another minor annoyance: I was not aware that the Admiral lounge was only for first class passengers that were on 'flagship' airplanes, and not for American Eagle. No where on the website had I read that (maybe I didn't see it), and instead had the impression that Alaska Airlines first class passengers were also able to use the 'partner' American Airlines Admiral lounge.

We were on standby a little confused about the process and we were hoping to see if our unassigned seats were available so we knew (hopefully) where we were going to sit. The American Airlines employee then continued to high five her co-worker completely ignoring us. She turned to us after a few minutes of waiting then stating that the computers were down, and that there was nothing else we can do. Shortly after she told my girlfriend to stand and wait at the front desk. She chit chatted more with her coworker about non-work related stuff. She then rudely stated “what else can I help you with!?” which made us very uncomfortable - so much so that we left to cool down. After looking at very expensive snack prices we came back to find a new line had formed at the gate desk. Overall we did not catch the flight, even though we were 1st and 2nd on the standby list.

There were no other flights that night, so in total panic mode, I began rearranging our entire trip! Luckily, I was able to book last minute flights through Delta and JetBlue for the following day, November 1, 2021. I had to push our entire trip back a day with our resort and reschedule our excursions we had planned since our original dates now didn't work.

The man I spoke with was very nice, but said he couldn't help with compensation and could only refund the plane tickets. Fine. He instructed to me to email customer relations about my complaint and to include that I could show proof of purchase for the new covid tests and extra night of dog boarding and that they should at least compensate me for those.

"""AA promising a service and not delivering""",1,2021-11-01,"Not Verified |  I am visiting in Minnesota returning on Halloween, October 31 2021 on a 6.37am direct flight to Charlotte (arrives in Charlotte at 10.20am). I get up early in preparation of driving the 7 miles from my hotel to the airport, returning rental car etc. I get an email at 2.59am stating that my flight has been cancelled and they have rebooked/held my spot on a flight the next day that leaves at 6.22 pm and arrives in Charlotte at 11.49pm which is simply not acceptable. Who pays for another night in a hotel? A rental car for a day? Meals? I quickly jump on a computer and see that an American Airline flight direct to Charlotte leaves at 5.00am and has seats available. The problem is I will not make this flight by 20 to 30 minutes assuming security, drive etc. goes flawlessly. This is highly disturbing when you are informed at the airport that they knew about these cancellation the night before. Why would this 5am flight have seats open? Surely someone along with myself would have grabbed this opportunity. I rush to airport as you cannot get through to the AA Customer Service via telephone. Another cancelled flight passenger told me at the airport that they told him it would take 4 hours to get through. I start a new job the next day (this can be verified if necessary) and have to get home. So at the airport naturally there are long lines for AA departures. The employees of AA are obviously instructed to take passengers for flights that are not cancelled so we are in a line that is manned by one employee and each person takes at least 10 minutes - it would take several hours to talk with someone. AA is simply letting us know that we are not important and basically ""screwed"". I have no choice but to book with another airline. I used miles for my flight so doling out $450 for the flight is irritating. The bag charge was a wash as I assume I get reimbursed for that with AA and my miles. The reason above that I have not flown with AA for so long is two fold. My last trip was to be to San Francisco but AA in their ultimate profit drive changes that flight so my vacation would be cut a day as I would have arrived over 24 hours later. Before that I cancelled the AA Miles card since I had issues. I get that a company needs to make profit but complete disregard for customers is not a long term profitable solution. I often wonder if all the flight attendants reports on passenger behaviors is partly a result of the frustrating experience that flying has become. I am writing this after returning home on Halloween day at 5.00pm. The AA website when using anything like the chat is erroring out, not flights however. Maybe it is overloaded or simply a low priority. It is insulting to see AA has articles nationally in the paper attributing over 700 flight cancellations Halloween weekend to weather in Fort Worth/Dallas and some staffing issues. Delta did not have any cancellations, just delays so we know AA has other issues besides weather they are trying to keep covered up. One has to wonder if any delays at one airport will set off a cascade of cancellations with AA. I am out over $450 from my pocket due to AA promising a service and not delivering. The FAA needs to start implementing mandatory rules regarding flight cancellations and restitution to paying customers. At a minimum I should get a $450 voucher for flight or flights with AA as well as everything back from cancelled flight.",False,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,MInneapolis/St. Paul to Charlotte,October 2021,1,1,,1,1,,,False

No responsibility, no empathy, no desire to help fix it, and no communication other than, ""I already said I was sorry for the inconvenience."" I told her it was unacceptable and I wanted to speak to her supervisor. So she said she would have to put me on hold for 2-5 minutes. I said fine.

She advised that they would do it at the Charlotte gate and that the flight had plenty of open seats. Once I got to Charlotte, I approached the counter at the gate to inquire about available sets since my husband and I were not seated together.

"""the worst travel experience""",1,2021-08-12,"Not Verified |  American Airlines is responsible for the worst travel experience I’ve ever had. My family including a 9 and 6 yr old plus grandma planned a flight out of Detroit, MI to Durango, CO with a layover in Dallas, TX. Our initial flight was delayed due to “maintenance and paperwork”. This caused us to miss our connecting flight. Although inconvenient, that in itself wasn’t the issue. These things happen. What follows is the problem. We were given no instructions on what to do next. There was no one at the gate…or any other AA gate. We dragged the family across the airport to where our missed flight gate was. No one there. After 45 min, we found a gate with an AA worker. After searching for another flight, we were told the only option is the following day at 10pm (it’s 9am at this point). Not satisfied we asked if there was anything else we could do. She was short with us, rude, and unwilling to help any further. She handed us a post card with a customer service number. We learned from a different airport employee that there was a customer service desk in the other side of the airport. We dragged the family over there. There was a 1.5 hour wait. In the meantime, we were on the phone with customer service (who showed effort in helping). With the help of the phone service, the desk attendant tried to piece together options to a different airport 100 miles from our destination. This required us to change rental car plans. But the desk attendant said that I would have to figure that out and go to the back of the line again. And her shift was almost done, so she said we would have to start all over again and there would be no guarantee that flight is available. Between my wife and I using 3 phones, we had to figure it out on our own over the next couple hours which resulted in a flight later in the afternoon to an airport 100 miles from our destination which took a 2.5 hour drive. But before we even got on that flight, we were told the gate attendant would help us get our kids seats switched so they didn’t have to sit alone (age 6 and 9). This attendant was less helpful and more rude than any of the previous ones. He just said we would have to figure it out on the plane. Towards the end of our now shortened vacation, we tried to check in early for our returning flight only to be told that it no longer exists. During that earlier process, they completely cancelled our flight. The seats were no longer available. So we had to spend 5 hours on the last day of our vacation scrambling to find a way home. We have since contacted American Airlines about this experience. All they offered us was $100 total credit. Completely unacceptable considering what we paid for 5 tickets and the experience we had. I have spoken to many others with similar experiences. I will NEVER use American Airlines again.

"""Extremely disappointing""",1,2021-08-12,"My family, which includes my 3 and 5 year old children, was flying from Chicago to Greenville. We strategically chose a nonstop flight because, as we all know, children and flying don’t always mix well. We were at our gate, the agent, who was a pleasant young man, was speaking over the intercom assuring us the flight will definitely take place. The plane pulls up, the pilot walks on, and the flight gets cancelled 4 minutes before boarding. They decide to go to Dayton instead. I then book it to the customer service line which is growing longer by the second. The agent at the counter tells me the BEST they can do is fly us to Raleigh at 11:30pm, arrive at 1:30am, wait seven hours to get on a 8:30am flight to DC, wait another three hours and go from DC to Greenville at 12:30, arriving at 2:30. We were supposed to be home Sunday night, now we have to sleep in an airport and get home the next afternoon?? And because it’s “weather related” you can’t offer us a hotel? This is borderline inhumane. We get to Raleigh at 1:30am, Raleigh airport kicks us out to do a security sweep. My 3 and 5 year old children are napping on a bench near baggage, waking up crying every 30 minutes, my husband is sleeping on the floor, and I’m up stewing. I get on the American Airlines website and I, a non-American-airlines-employee, find a flight from Raleigh to Charlotte and then from Charlotte to Greenville, getting us to Greenville by 8:30am. Why didn’t they offer this option in the first place? Why is it that I could do a better job than the agent I waited in a mile long line could do? And that’s not even the best part. We get home home and our luggage is lost. I will say that the agent at the lost baggage counter at GSP was amazing. She found our luggage, instructed me on how to track it so I could later see that, surprise surprise, my luggage would later be late again. But I eventually got my luggage so I can finally take a shower at 7pm. The original plan was to get home Sunday night at 11:30pm, sleep in, send the kids to daycare, and spent the rest of Monday getting our lives back together. But no, we all slept all day on Monday recovering from the abuse we endured all night thanks to American Airlines. Kids were up all night Monday night. Great times.

"""no social distancing""",2,2021-08-10,"I used to love American Airlines. We go way, way back. It was honestly, the only airline I ever flew, mostly because I would acquire and use miles. Unfortunately, Covid has created a lot of problems for everyone and created inconveniences and extra costs for airlines.  AA claims their filtration is top-notch. And that may be so, when the aircraft is in flight with doors closed. But when on-boarding and off-boarding a hot, stagnant aircraft, in the boarding areas, on the jetway and yes, in the aircraft during flight, you are breathing the air of those close to you with no mask or their mask below their nose! I am not talking about during eating or drinking. I am talking about continuous, extended time periods and while talking. AA does nothing effective to enforce or even suggest compliance among passengers waiting to board, among those boarding and with non-complying passengers on the aircraft. I am vaccinated. But consistently on every AA flight I have taken in the last year, the boarding areas are chaos with no social distancing, a large number of people are maskless or cheating with their masks below their noses (same as no mask, right?), maskless people are even boarding and talking unchecked. And the same behavior takes place on the aircraft during flight while not eating or drinking. I advised our flight attendant out of Dallas of the situation during boarding the other day and asked her to ask offending passengers to comply. All she did was respond that, ""they (crew) are going to make an announcement"" and that ""I have to get these overhead bins shut."" In my opinion, it is not on passengers to ask others to comply but on the airline (that is putting us into these tight, tight quarters to start with). I got a similar response from other AA attendants on other flights. Interestingly, the first class attendant was wearing gloves and closing overhead bins with a 2 ft long stick with a rubber tip. So she is afraid to touch bin lids in the aircraft yet is fine breathing unmasked and poorly masked passenger air? It is very disappointing - AA claims ""Your safety is our priority"" on signage and has Covid videos online and all the right notices and corporate speak. Guess what American? You know passengers cheat - attendants check for seat belts, seat backs and tray tables all the time! Yet unmasked passengers walk right by your boarding agents and flight attendants? It is all meaningless when so many AA passengers freely and openly disobey federal law in American Airlines boarding ares and on American Airlines flights. An American employee drove the transportation cart right by me effectively unmasked with mask below his nose. I am not one to fear this controversial Covid, over-react to the media or dis-regard the rights of those who wish to remain un-vaccinated.

Once this trip was over and i was set to return myself and a few of my friends who were traveling with me some had different flights found out all of our flights were canceled. We called over and over and no one could get us a flight out. We were stuck! We asked to get flown to a bigger city with a larger hub with the possibility of having more options. Eventually we were told to fly to Montana at 8pm that night and stay the night in the airport for the next flight to Dallas. By the way, because it was a small airport they closed the terminals at midnight so we had to sleep by the baggage claim until TSA opened the next day. No hotels were reasonable close by.

"""do my damnedest to never fly American Airlines again""",2,2021-08-05,"Not Verified |  Where do I begin. On the way to the airport I get a text message notification that my flight had been canceled. There is no further information not even a link to say why there was a cancellation. We decided to head to the airport regardless, once we get in line for American Airlines to talk to someone apparently there was a person going around telling everyone to either call a number or to download the American Airlines app. I do not know why this employee seems so insistent but I feel as though it was to get people out of line so they wouldn't have a back up. I refused to get out of line and continued on to the front counter. Once I Got there, I'm glad I did not get out of line, they apparently they rebooked me for the following day at 2:20 in the afternoon. Mind you I did not receive any confirmation or communication regarding this flight change. The only communication I got from American Airlines was that my flight to Dallas and the other flight from Dallas to Sacramento had been canceled. The lady that helped me was very nice considering all the people she was dealing with and told me that it was canceled due to weather. Even though my phones weather radar didn't really show too big of a storm over Dallas. This attendant was able to help me and booked my new flight for 9 AM to North Carolina and then from North Carolina I would to go to Sacramento. After that was said and done we leave the airport and as were leaving we're here over the intercom that the flight to Dallas is now boarding mind you again my connecting flight was to Dallas. So we arrived at the airport frustrated and we left even more frustrated after hearing what was on the intercom. I finally get on the plane the next morning and make it to North Carolina. I go to the front desk and ask if I can be placed on the standby list to see if I can get an earlier flight as my flight was going to leave North Carolina at 8:30. I was told that there is only one flight that leaves North Carolina directly to Sacramento which is the flight that I'm on or that I was on at 8:30. As I got close to 830 I get a message that my gate has changed, so I go to the gate and it says that the flights delayed. We were supposed to board at approximately 830 we did not board until approximately 9 o'clock. The flight only had mild turbulence and my seat did not recline at all so I was in the upright position through the whole 5 1/2 hour flight. We get to Sacramento half an hour to 45 minutes late finally and you could see everybody just rushed out of the plane because everybody was done by that point. I will do my damnedest to never fly American Airlines again. The only part that was OK was the attendant who help me that's it. I'd also like to mention that from Pensacola to North Carolina the flight staff showed no intention to enforce the mask mandate as I saw several people without their masks on during a time when there was no eating. It was very frustrating and I felt horribly uncomfortable sitting on the plane. Now with regards to the flight from North Carolina to Sacramento there was more enforcement of the mask rule but not by very much. There were still several people who had their masks under their nose or under their chin at a time when no one was eating and neither were those people.",False,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Pensacola to Sacramento,August 2021,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",2,1,,2,False

They messed up my name on my ticket (putting my middle initial as my last name?) and when I contacted them to get it fixed I had to be on hold for 14 hours. They called back at 3:28 in the morning, of course, I wasn't awake then I had to wait on hold for another 6 hours, which is crazy, within 24 hours of my flight because I was trying to check-in. So they charged me to ""fix"" my name which was their mistake and said I must get to the airport early. So I had to leave work (pay) early. Then, on the trip back, their site would not let me or my friend check in. So I had to get to the airport early again and they charged me, again, to be able to board the flight. I called after this entire situation and after 16 different transfers over the span of two weeks I was finally made aware of their customer relations line. The customer relations line offers no customer relations. I was told to email them, which I did, but you're automatically directed to submit through this form, therefore your original email never existed, you do that and they get back to you any range from two weeks (me) or two months (me again). The person you work with sends you an email saying ""respond directly back to this email"" and then it directs you back to the form to start the entire process over. Overall, if you want to save yourself time, money, even more money and overall stress do not book with American Airlines. I have never dealt with these issues. I also did not receive any service or compensation for the problems this airline caused because even though they made a huge mistake, of course they did not want to acknowledge it, and therefore place blame on anyone but themselves-even the customer. I showed documents and proof galore, it was all on American Airlines company site, yet then they tried and tell me that I was never on their site and never spoke with them. How the heck did I book the flight and eventually (after being charged numerous times) get on the flight if I never went on the site or spoke with them? I am honestly still in a state of shock to see how this airline treats their clients. This was my first and last time flying them, they need to do something about their mistakes. I still cannot believe how much they messed up and took from me. A company like this honestly should not be operating, I do not want this to happen to anyone else.

Well since they canceled multiple (which we found out today was because of rain) we had to go to 10 different hotels to find a room. The people at the American desk basically told us they can't help us and we are shit out of luck. We tried to call American and was on hold for 2 hours before we gave up.

If you complain to them you will be greeted with careless nonchalant concierges. Doors should’ve been closed to passengers 15 minutes before departure which is company policy, which I myself have been denied during entry before countless times having to rebook while the plane is still attached to the terminal with open seats because I was not within the 15 minutes! Well get this not once but twice in one trip the pilot was boarding passengers up to 20-30 minutes after departing time. The entire flight had to rebook connecting flights and cancel appointments made months ahead of time.

"""American Airlines abandoned me halfway across the country""",1,2021-08-03,"I live in CT, and tried to take a trip to NC because I had an important appointment made over a month in advance, that cost $175 to make. My flight was scheduled for July 11th with 1 stop. Well, at midnight July 11th, hours before my flight, I was notified my flight got cancelled. Called American Airlines to find it took from midnight to 8pm to get off hold. Literally 20 hours on hold. The person told me that they had no flights going out the 11th, and that the next flight was on the 12th. Great, just missed the appt I waited a month and paid for. Now my entire trip has no value or meaning. Well, I paid for 4 Choice Window seats so that I get the seats I want, and guess what? That $35 per seat isn't refunded or transferred to the new plane. They just decided I don't get to choose my seats anymore despite paying for them. First flight went down, landed in WA, then of course the 2nd flight was delayed 3 and a half hours. Got to NC over a day late, tired and didn't even have a reason to be there anymore. Whatever. So, my return was scheduled on July 16th with one stop in Philly. Of course, I drive 2 hours from Murphy NC to Ashville for the airport, and in the parking lot I get a text saying they cancelled my flight to Philly, but not the one to CT. Wow. So their plan was to fly me to Philadelphia, leave me there, and not even take me to CT. Call them again and wait 7 hours for them to get off hold, and they tell me there's no flights to CT until the 18th. I looked and found Southwest and Delta Air Lines were both flying from NC to CT with no issue, and was told that only American Airlines cancelled. Are you kidding me? So, they rescheduled my flight for the 18th, and I had to pay for a hotel for 2 days in NC as well as tell my boss at work that American Airlines abandoned me halfway across the country and refused to take me home. He wasn't happy. I also had to call my grandfather and tell him for the next two days, I'd need him to drive an hour to my house to care for my animals. Great.

""Were sorry but a component of the plane has broken and we are going to need a new aircraft, please wait as we reboard you."" Are you actually kidding? I had to stay another 5 hours in the airport waiting for a new plane to come so we could take our flight. I get back to CT 3 days late, to find those extra 3 days also cost me $70 in airport parking. My original flight was $670. I paid $35 x 4 for choice seats. I didn't receive a single one of those seats. I paid to leave on July 11th, I was forced to leave on the 12th. I paid to come back on July 16th, I was forced to come back July 18th. I did a quick online booking, which led to 28 hours on hold on the phone.

This tells me the plane was not cleaned even though there are signs in the gate area posted by American airline on how their passenger safe is important and they keep with the highest standards of sterilizing.

On July 23rd, my wife, 4-month old daughter and I were scheduled to fly from Los Angeles to Tel Aviv with a connection in Miami. We were astonished to learn that parents with an infant were prevented from selecting seats online and especially via a representative. This seat selection blunder ended up getting us the worst seats on the plane, which might have been the least of our problems with American Airlines. On our way to the airport we saw that our flight was an hour delayed. As we did the check in, your AA representative said this would not be a problem and we will still make the connection from Miami to Tel Aviv. So, we proceeded with the check-in and went through security. After an hour waiting for boarding, we saw that the flight was delayed for an additional hour. This of course meant we would miss the connecting flight to Tel Aviv. The staff at the gate told us to speak to the staff at the customer service booth at LAX. The service at the AA booth had us waiting for over an hour in line, and almost made us miss our flight! After waiting for almost an hour, we were only told by customer service representative to go on the flight and the staff in Miami will have to guide us on what to do next. When we boarded the flight, they told us we needed to check in one of our carry on's that contained all of our baby stuff for the flight and when we said we needed it with us - they told us we are the last ones. And said, that it is our fault we needed to check in - mind you, we were only late because we were standing in customer service line for an hour. This lack of foresight, care, and empathy for a family traveling with an infant is beyond me. And is a true reflection of the character of this airline. When we landed in Miami around 9pm, we got off the flight and immediately were sent to re-booking without our luggage. When we tried to find our luggage we were told it was on hold because we were supposed to have a connecting flight which we missed due to the delay. We were in line to re-book for over 2 hours. When we finally got to rebook a flight to Tel Aviv, we were told that since all American Airlines hotels are full they were unable to offer us any accommodation and we need to pay out of pocket for accommodation, transportation, new covid test and food. As far as we know the airline must provide accommodation and food vouchers if a flight has been cancelled or delayed due to the airline's fault. We ended up paying $350 to rent a car so we can get to our hotel, we paid $400 for 2 nights for accommodation, we had to do a new rapid covid test which cost us $150 ($450 for the 3 of us), in addition to $300 for food cost, and an extra $100 for clothes and diapers since we didn't receive our luggage.

"""offered me no wheelchair assistance""",1,2021-07-26,"I am 80 years old and recently suffered a major medical event while fishing in Corpus Christi and spent a week in ICU. After I was released, I was too weak to drive back home to Lubbock, so I booked a one-way ticket on American Airlines and paid for First Class and wheelchair assistance the whole way because I am unable to walk more than a few feet at a time. I got on the plane in Corpus, and he made it to Dallas just fine, but that is when all hell broke loose. First, the AA staff abandoned me in my wheelchair, and I had to rely on the help of kind strangers to help me get to the next gate. I had a two-hour layover, but the flight was delayed (no explanation). Then I was told he had to go to another gate, and again AA staff abandoned me and left me sitting in a wheelchair. Fortunately, another kind stranger helped me get to the new gate. Then, that flight was delayed as well. Eight hours later, at 1:30 am, AA announced the flight had been canceled but did not tell me about it. I am sound of mind, but at my age, I do not do well with smartphones and email, which is how AA notifies people these days. AA canceled my flight and his ticket and just left me sitting in a wheelchair in the DFW airport at 1:30 am. I had to call my son at 1:30 am and have him look things up online and tell me what was going on. He found that AA had booked me a room at a hotel, but I would have to travel via shuttle miles from the airport to get there, and I had no way to even get to the shuttle, even if I knew where to go. Thank God for more kind strangers that helped me get there. When I got to the hotel, the clerk at the hotel was the meanest person I have ever met. He was shouting and yelling at everyone. He was screaming at me that I had to show him the code AA had sent me for the hotel. As I said, I am not good with smartphones and did not know how to find what he wanted.  I had to call my son again at 2:30 am to have him help me. He texted me a screenshot of the code and asked me to hand my phone to the clerk so he could see it. My son asked the man to understand my situation and help me, but the clerk started shouting at my son and told me that if I did not show him the code, I would have to leave the hotel. I have never seen such horrible service. Afterward, I found out that AA commonly uses this Atrium hotel for canceled flights, and this is not an uncommon occurrence that tired travelers are treated like this at this hotel. My son has contacted the owner of the hotel about my treatment by this clerk, demanding an apology.  AA booked me on another flight the next day at 1:00 pm. I had paid for a First Class aisle seat at the front of the plane, but they stuck me at the very back of the plane in a window seat.

"""you are not a family friendly airline""",2,2021-07-20,"Not Verified |  American Airlines, I wish to express my extreme disappointment in your airline and customer service. Last month, my family and I boarded your planes for a trip to Hawaii. It was an extremely disappointing experience. Your airline is the least family friendly I have ever met. Most airlines offer pre-boarding for families with small children. This is a great service especially for a family like mine that was traveling with a 1 year old and a 6 year old. I had purchased a seat for my 1 year old so that I would be able to use a car seat. Pre-boarding would have been beneficial to give the time to install a car seat. Please consider making your airline more family friendly with a pre-boarding option. (Especially since seats are assigned.) First, we boarded a severely delayed flight at Salt Lake City International Airport in hopes that we would make our connecting flight in Phoenix. To our dismay we found out that what was supposed to be a 2 hour layover in Phoenix would have to turn into a mad dash to a different terminal and gate to make a flight leaving within minutes of our arrival. If we missed this connection we would have to be retested for COVID. With two small children this was almost impossible. Somehow, it worked. However, after boarding and while trying to install the car seat, the flight attendant yelled at my father who was trying to help me. In fact, her exact words were “You need to sit down. We are not delaying this flight because you won’t take your seat.” When we explained what we were doing she responded with “I don’t care. It is time to take your seat.” She didn’t offer to help. My father complied with her wishes and sat down as I continued to struggle to hold a 1 year old and install a car seat so he could fly safely while we taxied down the runway. I understand that we chose to fly during a global pandemic, and we tried to comply with mask requirements, however, there is no shame in being a decent human being, which some of your flight attendants were not. During the flight my one year began to cough. One of your flight attendants came over and asked where his mask was. I explained that he was under two and not required. To which came the response, “You need to either put a mask on that child or make him stop coughing.” I tried to explain that my 1 year old was simply choking on water, but the flight attendant then cut me off “Look Lady, just mask the kid.” and walked away! This reaction was extremely rude and uncalled for, especially since this flight attendant didn’t wear his mask over his nose as required! I expected more from your customer service. Also, our six year old was napping on the 6 hour flight. When the snack cart came by, my husband simply asked for a drink for when she woke up. The same flight attendant responded with, “I don’t think you are really asking me to waste a drink on a child who won’t wake up. You just want a second drink.” I purchased the seat, which entitled me to a snack whether my child was awake or not! This was only made worse when two rows behind me a man asked for a second can of soda and the flight attendant gave it to him without complaint. This cemented the idea that you are not a family friendly airline! I am never going to fly American Airlines again if I can help it. Nor would I recommend it to any of my friends.

When she sat down I was already good and annoyed. I grumbled under my breath because I had to move away from her side to sit in the middle of my seat (touching the guy next to me). To say I was crammed was an understatement. She was so unbelievably rude to me (“excuse me! I’m so sorry for your inconvenience). For the 5 hours I was so fuming mad. Worst experience ever and she made me feel like I was sub human. I kept my mouth shut because I didn’t want to be that person but this was highly unacceptable.

The night before our flight it appeared that our seats had disappeared.

We waited in line for hours at the re-booking counter and then were issued new plane tickets around 10pm for the following day. We were told that we could get a hotel and would be reimbursed up to $200 for it plus the transportation costs to and from the hotel since the airport didn’t have any vacant hotel rooms. We even got a text message from American Airlines stating ‘American Airlines: Sorry for the change in travel plans. A complimentary hotel room is available for everyone in your reservation.’ The man at the booking counter who issued our tickets gave us a link to see if we could get a hotel room at the airport. He told us that they have all been booked so it’s doubtful but we can get a hotel on our own instead but would have to pay upfront and then be reimbursed. He gave us instructions to send an email to the address on the back of the ticket with our receipts and we would be refunded up to $200 for a hotel plus travel costs to the hotel and from the hotel back to the airport.
