"""It was a highly stressful ordeal""",1,2022-05-15,"On May 12th, 2022, EA flight number 2D 322 that was to take off at 6:55 am from JFK to GYE was cancelled without warning. For more than 24 hours, we were kept waiting at JFK by EA agents while the plane underwent mechanical and electrical repairs. We were repeatedly assured that we will depart as soon as the plane was fixed. In their first announcement, EA agents announced to waiting passengers that the flight was rescheduled for 3pm of that day only to have it changed to 11pm. Again the flight was rescheduled to May 13th, 2022 at 2:00 am, but it failed to take off despite repeated and multiple assurances from EA agents. While waiting at the boarding lounge, we were forced from there to outside the security cordon so that we had to go through TSA check-in and immigration twice. Throughout the day we were bounced from terminal to terminal and gate to gate. We had to lug our luggage from one part of the airport to another. Not only did we carry heavy luggage but some of us have disabilities, medical conditions children while others are elderly which made movement around the airport torturous. We endured more than 24hrs without food and water. It was a highly stressful ordeal that EA put us through.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Guayaquil,May 2022,1,1,,1,1,,False
"""very dissatisfied and disappointed""",1,2022-05-14,"Back in December of 2021 my family decided to go for our mothers funeral, she passed 2021 and due to COVID we were unable to attend. Two days before our travel this airline canceled our flights and we were obligated to purchase tickets with a different airline. Although it was a very bad experience we decided to give them a second chance. This time purchase a ticket for my elderly father (we live 5 hrs from the international airport), for May 8, a week previous to the travel day received a msg stating the flight got rescheduled to May 13. A day before the flight I received a message that the new time switched from 3:30pm to 10pm, My father gets to the airport on the May 13 at 6pm and the flight is completely canceled, we did not receive any messages, No emails, no phone calls. I paid someone to take my dad to the airport but the driver is not allowed at the airport so he dropped my father off and left. I called customer services they started it was 11pm and to call back during business hours. I had to jump and literally do magic to have him in the next flight with a different airline. This airline lost my respect and will never purchase another ticket. I called them this morning and their answer was we had to cancel this flight for major reasons. I understand things happen, but be ready to be responsible to take care of your customers and communicate as soon as possible. You have no idea what people go thru to even purchase and paid a flight ticket .. very dissatisfied and disappointed.",True,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Guayaquil to New York,June 2021,,,,1,1,,False
