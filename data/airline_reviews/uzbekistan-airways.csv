"""Safety was not a priority for cabin crew on this flight""",1,2021-11-07,"Very disappointed with Uzbekistan Airways service, from boarding until landing in Tashkent. Booked flight with my kids from DXB-TAS on the 7th of November. It started at the airport in DXB, where I requested to get seats in the forward cabin, as it is challenging with small kids to move with luggage all the way to the end of the cabin. The ground staff asked the supervisor if he could offer us forward cabin seats, he refused. He was rude not only with me but with the poor ground staff who was trying to tell him the correct procedure. I have flown many times with Uzbekistan Airways and I have noticed that he has been super rude with passengers and staff at all times (in Dubai and Sharjah). When I came onboard, surprisingly I noticed that there were so many empty seats in the forward cabin! So why did he refuse a mother with 2 small kids to offer a comfort? I assume he is backed up by someone, because this kind of unacceptable attitude for so many years and nobody takes any action! Inflight: - Safety was not a priority for cabin crew on this flight, for take off some windows were dimmed, some were bright - I had two obese passengers sitting through the aisle (35E,F) for take off with their seatbelts were not fastened. Grooming of the crew was extremely poor, especially 2 crew who were seated in L3/R3 door. Male crew who worked from the AFT was not interested to serve us and other passengers, he spoke to us as if we were at the military and he was the general with us, soldiers. When he was serving lunch, somebody asked him for a glass of water, he said that he only has white wine on top of his cart. When I asked him what chicken was served with, he had difficulty in answering. He saw me struggling during disembarkation with kids and my luggage, he didn't even offer to assist us to disembark the aircraft - Not to mention that lavatories were dirty throughout the flight. On this flight the crew didn't smile and welcome guests, they all gave impression that they were forced to come and do this flight, except one who was super positive and welcoming from boarding.

After much deliberation, we did choose to fly with Uzbekistan Airways because we also realized that the company has improved in recent years, and in terms of flight time with small children it suited and it was important for us to land early in Bangkok, since we had a flight from Bangkok to Koh Samui Island.

"""seat cramped, cabin crew unfriendly""",1,2016-06-03,"✅ Verified Review | Singapore to Kuala Lumpur with Uzbekistan Airways (HY551). I travel frequently between Singapore and KL, and I can say that it was my worst flight experience on this route. The boarding process was chaotic, I queued for at least 15 mins before boarding. The seat was very cramped and the cabin crew were unfriendly. The cabin was very stuffy before the takeoff. During the flight, there was no refreshment at all, apart from the welcome drink which was served before takeoff. There were PTVs available at every seat but it took me ages even to switch the language to English.

Uzbekistan Airways customer review,8,2014-10-28,LHR-TAS-LHR seat 3J (a window seat) in both directions. A good experience all-round and with a Business Class fare at a little over a thousand Pounds excellent value for money. My flight was operated by HY's latest 767s which come with comfy seats AVOD iPads loaded with films and games attentive service and excellent food. The cabin is decorated tastefully with a blue and cream theme. The eastbound flight is an overnight operation so I slept most of the way. The seats recline but do not go fully flat not even to angled lie-flat. Nevertheless they are comfortable enough and I achieved about six hours sleep so on arrival I was ready to dive straight in to activities on the ground. Breakfast was a choice of sushi and antipasti which were both of high quality. The westbound flight was operated in daylight hours and I enjoyed it a great deal. The stewardess was extremely attentive and the food including traditional Uzbek plov was excellent. Note that seats in row 1 do not offer stowage for slippers glasses books and so on whilst rows 2 and 3 do.

Plus points - on-time in both directions reasonable ground experience felt safe some staff efficient and multilingual and completes London-Tashkent in half the time of the alternatives e.g. Aeroflot. Negative points - old 757 in both directions with fairly uncomfortable seats and limited legroom highly limited entertainment on small drop-down screens (e.g.dated film dubbed into Russian) and juddering audio channels food in generous quantities but mediocre tepid and tasteless tea some cabin crew rude and sighed heavily at minor requests from passengers or barked one word instructions random/unfair means of allocating front row seats once on board. One highlight is the bizarre video (played three times to cover Uzbek Russian and English) illustrating that passengers are prohibited from drinking duty free spirits fighting smoking playing with safety equipment or stealing airline property! In summary the airline does OK given their ageing fleet and the country's limited exposure to non-CIS countries.

We didn't try their food but the special meals we ordered were awful. Out of the 8 legs only one (the last thankfully) did we feel unsafe and that was because of turbulence.

But they did move. Wasn't that cheap considering the plane we were in. Couldn't relax until we arrived. Had some peanuts and flavoured water served to us.

Tea was served in a plastic cup with broken ear. But with a smile. Some sort of business-class package given with slippers and sleeping mask. Tashkent - Frankfurt service fine only overhead IFE. I managed to fold down my chair to almost lie-flat - before realising it was because it was broken. My fellow passenger behind me protested with a moan (I would have been louder actually).

Uzbekistan Airways customer review,6,2009-11-10,"If you book your flight in Tashkent you get what you pay for - basic service that will get you from A to B with no frills. However if you book your flight outside of Uzbekistan the flight prices are ridiculous. I regularly fly LHR-TAS-LHR. If I have my ticket booked in Tashkent it costs approx $350 return - if booked in London costs me about £550 from the airline. I take great issue with the check in at Heathrow. There are 3 check in desks to check in about 300 people. Many of those 300 speak little or no English which makes the process more prolonged and agonising. There is a screen that says ""Tashkent- Business class check in"". This isn't used for Business class only and even those paying a premium price can expect to wait up to 2 hours to check in. Boarding is as expected - everyone pushes but my experience has been that everyone sits in their allocated seats. Inflight entertainment is poor seats are comfortable and cleanliness is acceptable.

The Uzbek Air desk at the airport was unmanned and the airport information desk said there was no flight - as printed on my ticket - it did not exist! After wasting the day at the airport turned up at my hotel again and eventually found the city office for the airline on Tuesday - an obscure office tucked away in a dark and dingy building. They photocopied my ticket and said it would be sent to Tashkent for ""investigation."" How much of an investigation is there for a ticket printed for a flight that does not exist? Phoned them back yesterday (Friday) as they had not called me back as promised! I can indeed fly - but for a fee of 25 Euro! In their view it was my error not to turn up to their office on Monday given that I arrived ""late"" on the Tuesday. I had not contacted them ""immediately"". Never mind that nobody was at their airport desk and that airport information tried hard to reach them. Worse the flight that I should have been on - has my ticket been printed correctly- has been cancelled anyway. So either way I would have been inconvenienced!

The rumour had it that it was to pick up the UZB president's daughter. All this meant the flight to TAS would take 9hrs long 2 hrs longer than normal. Some people confirmed such unscheduled stopovers were quite commonplace. I was not impressed. Inflight service is pretty bad. So bad that when you call the stewardess they do not turn up. Even when they turn up they are so unhappy to be serving you so rude it is quite unbelievable. I did not eat the food that was served so can not comment on that.

Service fine and nice to get different tasting beers than the usual. FAs fine once they trust you are not going to be another difficult passenger. Uzbekistan Airways suffers from poor ground operations and officialdom at their airports which means that by the time people board the craft they are not always at their best. This is taxing on cabin crew who respond with professionalism even if they are not the greatest smilers. I understand Uzbekistan Airways are joining Skyteam. They are easily in the class of some other members of Skyteam now so hopefully this will mean more good connections in an area of the world they serve well.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,

Airplanes on international flights are mainly Boeings 757 quite new ones national manly Tupolevs 155M probably from 80´s. Space in planes is comparable to any other airlines service is quite pure. Local people do not look for right seats very carefully so the staff ask you to sit anywhere at the end of boarding. You also have to know that there are two separate buildings at the airport – national and international. The business lounge at Tashkent airport has improved a lot – if you travel in business or with gold cards look for business check-in counter which is located in the corridor next to main hall.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Uzbekistan Airways customer review,3,2008-12-31,Took two flights with this outfit a return TAS-ALA-TAS. The outbound flight went well booked it online via Opodo and was given an E-ticket. The aircraft was a Boeing 757. The return was a different matter and it all went wrong from here! I was not able to get the return flight I wanted but was advised to go to the airport in Almaty before the flight as they usually hold a couple of seats for every plane. My girlfriend is Russian and spoke to the staff on our behalf. We were informed that we could have two seats - but we would have to pay a bribe on top on the standard seat charges! I took exception at first but then worked out that it would be cheaper than paying an additional day for accommodation. However it then transpired that the staff were in-fact refusing seats to another couple telling them that check-in had closed for them when in reality there was 30 minutes left for check-in. Clearly they were being denied boarding so that the airline staff could collect my bribe! I felt terrible but did not have to cancel my deal with the staff as the couple being denied boarding work out that they would need to bribe the staff too! They did so and where allowed to proceed to check-in my girlfriend was then told the seats were not available after-all! She also informed me that they ground staff were really very rude indeed to this couple having threatened them with “trouble” if they complained about the flight being closed early! We went to a travel agent and book a normal ticket on a later flight without any bribes! That flight to Tashkent was then not on a nice 757 but on a Russian Tupolev 155 aircraft. While it is quite special in a way to have the full Soviet Union flying experience it is not comfortable quite or smooth! With no turbulence this thing rockets up and down like a fighter jet; the noise is such that you may as well be sitting on the wing! While we took off on-time we were met with fog in Tashkent and diverted to Sarmankand only landing in Tashkent some hours late. As such I missed my Aeroflot connection to Moscow and spent hours killing time in the airport. The funny thing was the only bar in the departure lounge does not take the national currency – just Russian Rubles and dollars! The cherry on the cake was again the ground staff coming back for bribes! I was well overweight for my Moscow connecting Aeroflot flight but $50.00 was exchanged and the matter resolved! In London the extra weight had cost me $300 which Aeroflot lost on my return thanks to the Uzbek business culture. Corruption has two sides it can be very disruptive and also very convenient but on the whole I can do without it in future.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,

Uzbekistan Airways customer review,3,2008-04-29,London to Tashkent and back. Once again the inflight experience was OK. Flights were on time both ways despite the usual Heathrow problems.

Uzbekistan Airways customer review,2,2008-01-24,Tashkent-Urgench-Tashkent. Staff try to get your money for everything even if most of them knows me personally after 5 years of same destination - extra baggage better seat etc. When you want to reserve a seat mostly you'll get a negative answer first. They will tell you that flight is full. What they do is reserve some seats for artificial names. That way the flight seems full when you attempt a reservation. If you pay an under-the-counter fee she will change the name on the reservation on your name and you got your seat. Same during check-in : they will ask you to put your hand bag/computer/whatever on to the scale. If you are somehow +20 they will start to make faces and convince you that it will be too expensive if you pay official fee. They will ask you to pay half of the money that you'll pay officially directly to check in staff. I don't do that now as the official fee is also is not that much. I simply ask them to write the extra weight which I check each time and go to pay to the counter. The officer in the counter is also surprised as this is not very common. If you'll ask for a specific seat they will make you understand that it is available against a small tip (2-3 USD). Don't as usually no one sits in accordance with the assigned seats and it is almost impossible to convince the person who have sit to your place to move. In the past you might also tip (20-50 USD) in the cabin and ask for a Business Class seat but I do not know if this is still possible.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Uzbekistan Airways customer review,3,2007-09-17,I have flown Uzbek air extensively including international regional and domestic flights. They are not a great airline by world standards but are great by regional standards. That said if you want to fly to Uzbekistan or fly within Uzbekistan you probably won’t have much of a choice but to fly Uzbek Air. If Uzbekistan is not a destination then they are probably overpriced for the service and I would use another carrier unless your schedule requires a transit though Tashkent. For international I would give them a 3 star overall and a 2 star for domestic flights.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Uzbekistan Airways customer review,3,2007-09-10,ATH-TAS return. Both flights on time. The personnel were friendly enough and eager to help you. The food was good only food presentation and trays were standard. There were two servings of drinks on each flight. The only complaint - inflight entertainment system was outdated (overhead screens with two outdated movies and some channels with music). The planes were old but clean. Overall a good experience with no troubles.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Uzbekistan Airways customer review,2,2007-08-22,LHR-TAS. My experience with this airline has been OK. They seem to keep to the flight times reasonably well at least out of Tashkent. There are some problems with the cabin crew - using mobile phones during take off being one example. A real issue I have with them is the chaotic check in at LHR. The last two times at LHR the queue has filled one end of terminal 2 and takes 2-3 hours to get through. The flight is typically delayed by an hour because of this.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
