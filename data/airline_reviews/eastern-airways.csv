"""she was more interested in speaking than offering me some help""",1,2022-06-13,"Not Verified |  After both flights were cancelled we were made to rearrange other flights, upon trying to claim the cancelled flights back through the 3rd party (Opodo) they said that there is no evidence that the flights were cancelled. I called Eastern Airways for one thing, an email from them confirming that the flights were indeed cancelled so that I could forward that to the 3rd party and progress with the refund process. At this point I, unfortunately, met with a customer service representative, it was pretty clear from the get-go she was more interested in speaking than offering me some help. I appreciated that this booking was made through a 3rd party but I just needed clarity. After repeating herself over and over telling me it basically wasn't her problem, to the point where her tone was something I wouldn't expect from anyone within a customer service environment, rude, abrupt and a complete disregard for the situation. I suggested that she is obviously is working from home because she would never speak to a customer like this in front of other colleagues she then said ""No I'm in an office and you are on loudspeaker"" and then got her colleagues to confirm that I was on loudspeaker by shouting from across the room that they could hear me. This bothers me for a few reasons, 1) the amount of effort that was taken not to help me could simply have been applied to sending an email and I would have come away from that phone call being a happy customer. 2) When I called I was greeted with a message informing me that there is a high wait time, however, Eastern Airways can afford to have 3 employees listening to a phone call. I am assuming that customers were waiting in a queue whilst these customer service representatives sat around and listened to the representative telling me should wouldn't help me for 15 mins. 3) What on earth am I doing on loudspeaker anyway? I hope that the phone calls are recorded so that this can be looked into, I will be sending an email to customer services and let them know of what just happened.

Eventually, the airport staff (whose behaviour was at all times sympathetic and polite) asked the other passengers who were waiting on the transit bus for a volunteer to give up their place, explaining the circumstances. Unfortunately, no one took pity on my plight and I was denied a place on the plane. I was left distraught and upset having missed an unrepeatable family event.

Eastern Airways customer review,1,2015-07-25,I have used Eastern Airways for a number of years as my commute to work in the offshore industry. They have always been expensive and have the monopoly on this route. I note when another carrier recently went into completion with them for the Aberdeen route from Leeds Bradford their prices dropped dramatically. I used to book the zonal route pass which bought 6 return flights with full flexibility for around £1700. For my last 6 return flights I booked the 13.10 to DTV. Eastern Airways after accepting my booking and payment cancelled 4 of them on the return portion for operational reasons which were half term holidays and such like. I had to take a later flight which got me to my destination later than had I used the train at a significantly lower cost. The last two flights from DTV to Aberdeen were late and cancelled also. Technical problems sometimes occur and have to be accepted but it seems much more common lately. This airline is unreliable and accepts bookings offering flexibility and then removes the flexibility.

Eastern Airways customer review,8,2010-06-17,Newcastle to Bergen return: We were flying on the smaller of their two aircraft and there were a total of four passengers plus one flight attendant. All four passengers were seated in the very rear of the plane most likely to balance the weight due to the small aircraft. The good thing about flying with Eastern was that probably it was included in the cost of the tickets but passengers are allowed to go through the Fast Track security line. Also at Newcastle International terminal gate 31 is exclusive for Eastern. The terminal lounge was tiny and had bowls of sweets and copies of their inflight magazine. The downside is that the aircraft is very noisy so one has a problem hearing the inflight announcements and the aircraft seems to feel turbulence being so tiny. Also if you need to use the toilet try not to otherwise it's located in the rear of the plane behind a door that you need to be sure is securely locked or you risk giving a show. I could not for anything find a sink but there was a bottle of hand sanitizer that was available. The flight from Bergen there was no dedicated terminal lounge. The so-called complimentary refreshments on both flights were only drinks and either a packet of sweet or savoury snacks. The flight from Bergen the flight attendant offered hot towels just prior to landing. This wasn't offered on the flight from Newcastle. The flights were over an hour each and I think they could and should have served sandwiches considering they advertise how they are a cut above the other airlines. Perhaps it's due to mounting costs but other than those tiny packets of snacks they bombarded us with sweets before and during the flights. The sweets are not the best quality too. Return flight had a total of twelve passengers and one flight attendant. As stated in earlier reviews it seems as though Eastern doesn't have a huge customer base so I'm not sure how they manage to exist.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Eastern Airways customer review,7,2010-03-10,Leeds-Bradford to Southampton plane was about half-full which seems fairly typical from the other reviews. Price was higher than Flybe but my employer paid . Everyone else also looked to be travelling on business - ie. no-one else would have been paying the fare themselves either. I suspect Eastern should be OK with the financial numbers if they can charge high amounts and half-fill the plane - this would be equivalent to quite a high loading (80%?) at Flybe prices. Flight itself was good helpful stewardess a very professional outfit. Excellent that they offer free Fast-Track at LBA - ideal for an early morning flight. Speaking of which they fly to Southampton earlier in the morning than Flybe which again is useful. It's also a really handy route Leeds to the south coast.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Eastern Airways customer review,10,2009-09-17,Have flown with Eastern several times now and found everybody friendly and helpful. At last an airline that cares about you - useful when a connection is missed owing to fog delays! It may cost a little more (although no hidden add-ons so not a lot of difference) but far better than the cattle trucks.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Eastern Airways customer review,10,2009-08-24,Southampton-Liverpool Saab 2000 very good product. The price you see is the price you pay no hidden charges. My concern is low passenger numbers this my third flight with Eastern all have been well below 50%.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Eastern Airways customer review,5,2009-07-17,Flew with Eastern NCL-SVG as they offered more suitable schedule over Widerøe who I would normally fly with. Tiny J41 with 18 passengers for the 1h30 flight. Hand baggage had to be surrendered at aircraft steps as limited space onboard (bag was laptop bag size) so keep hand baggage to a minimum if you really want it in the cabin. 2 cups of tea shortbread hot towel and sweets before take-off and landing all complimentary made such a difference to the flight. Flight attended very friendly and welcoming and flight deck kept you well updated on arrival time and weather. Would fly Eastern again however price can be very steep so book as soon as you know the dates of your holiday - it pays off to book early!,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Eastern Airways customer review,5,2009-07-12,Have flown Eastern quite a few occasions now and always found them informative efficient and friendly. Prices are a bit high although I travel on business and do not pay myself.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Eastern Airways customer review,5,2009-06-28,SOU-NCL return. More expensive than Flybe but much better product. My concern is only 6 pax up 9 back on Jetstream 41might have been slack day but these load factors cannot be profitable. Hope they continue as all routes been competition.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Eastern Airways customer review,2,2009-05-10,Just booked a flight to Los Angeles return cheaper than an Aberdeen-Humberside return - which is now close to £400. Still only half filling the plane and a huge customer base of offshore workers waiting for them to lower the price.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Eastern Airways customer review,5,2009-03-21,IOM-NCLNCL-ABZ. Great little airline very personal service form the point of check-in to inflight service. Both flights only half full so made the experience very pleasant. Extremely efficient and takes the edge in levels of service.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Eastern Airways customer review,4,2008-11-09,First time on Eastern - Stansted to Manchester return. Excellent aircraft and service however only four passengers on board going up and twelve coming back in a 29 seater. Reason I suspect is cost - could have flown to Dubai and back cheaper. I hope they survive as they are something different but Eastern must look at their pricing structure.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Eastern Airways customer review,5,2008-10-28,IOM-BHX return. Comfortable for a small plane punctual friendly. And cheap: or at least as cheap as Flybe for the same route (taking into account the extra charges I would have paid to Flybe). At Birmingham the Eastern boarding card allowed me access to the fast-track security queue (not that it helped) and a business lounge. The flight back arrived 15 minutes early and from leaving my seat on the plane to leaving the airport was an amazing 5 minutes (including collecting baggage from the carousel).,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Eastern Airways customer review,5,2008-10-20,Southampton To Angers return. On time attentive staff champagne nice snacks totally perfect. I notice some people complaining about the prices? In my opinion the price reflects the service and represents excellent value for money. I hope they continue with these lesser used routes.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Eastern Airways customer review,5,2008-10-09,I've previously flown with Eastern Airways between MAN-INV / LBA-INV but low cost airline FlyBE forced them to quit these routes earlier this year. Eastern Airways maybe a little pricey but professional excellent service and friendly staff makes up for it. I welcome Eastern Airways' return on these routes!,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Eastern Airways customer review,5,2008-10-01,Leeds Bradford to Southampton with Eastern Airways. Efficient friendly check in at LBA swift boarding and an on-time departure. Clean smart aircraft although I wouldn't like to do a longer trip on the J41! Informative captain friendly professional cabin crew. Offered drinks including champagne and snacks which was fine for the short flight. Arrived at SOU 10 minutes ahead of schedule. Very impressed with this airline and would use them again on this route.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Eastern Airways customer review,2,2008-10-01,I fly periodically with Eastern and agree with earlier comments about the friendliness and helpfulness of cabin staff. However their charges are pretty high and although they are cheaper on routes they compete with flybe on they are always more expensive. That is fine but I recently had to fly back from NCL to SOU and got to the airport much earlier than expected. Eastern showed no flexibility re: changing my ticket and demanded I purchase a new ticket. Fair enough so I asked for the taxes and charges to be transferred to the new ticket. Not only was this refused but the ticket agent was adamant that the taxes are not fundable. They cannot have it both ways - charge full service prices and behave like a low cost. Ironically if I was flying low cost such as Easyjet I could have done this for about £30 but with Eastern wanted closer to £150! It is hard to swallow when I am regularly paying £240 return for a domestic round trip. That degree of inflexibility is going to force me back onto Flybe.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Eastern Airways customer review,5,2008-08-14,Checked in by friendly and helpful girl at Leeds/Bradford. Straight through Fastrack. Eleven passengers in Jetstream so plenty of room. Flight attendant was friendly and welcoming. Drinks/snacks. Chatty captain. Landing at Southampton bng on time. Despite the extra cost (probably less if I didn't have to book the day before because of family bereavement) I will choose them if possible next time I fly. Before this flight I had never heard of them !,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Eastern Airways customer review,5,2008-07-15,CWL-NCL easy check in lounge very good took a couple of minutes from lounge to seat on aircraft. One cabin attendant fantastic service including complimentary drinks snacks sweets and hot towels on a 1 hour flight on 29 seater aircraft. Baggage reclaim at NCL took just a couple of minutes.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
