Airplane is not convenient if you have special needs. Aisle was very thin and the toilet was so small it was hard to move with the door closed. I will avoid this airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,
Olympic Air customer review,8,2013-06-28,From Athens to Santorini. The flying time was so short around 35 mins. But served cookies and hot drinks. The flight departed from Athens on time. Flight announcement was clear and correct.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
Olympic Air customer review,9,2013-06-07,SMI-ATH-SMI route (once or twice a month). OA uses small Bombardier airplanes whose seats do not recline. There is enough leg space (I am 185cm) and the seat width is fine. There is no inflight entertainment. The personnel has always been very polite and helpful. The only problem with OA are the outrageously high prices for its domestic flights especially for destinations like SMI where there is no competition.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,3,,True,
Olympic Air customer review,10,2013-05-28,I fly with Olympic Athens-Istanbul-Athens twice a month for the last 3 years and I'm very satisfied. They provide nice meals (even on short flights). What I dislike is that they partially switched to the Dash 8 Q 400 turboprops from the A320 for some destinations (Istanbul included sometimes). I'd recommend them.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,True,
Olympic Air customer review,8,2013-05-05,Athens-Limnos on a Q400. Check in quick and efficient. Boarding by bus but quite efficient too. The flight left five minutes early and arrived 15 minutes early. It was smooth and the friendly crew worked very hard to get everyone a drink and nuts on this 40-min flight. There was ample leg room. A good experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
Olympic Air customer review,8,2012-10-08,ATH-BEG-ATH with Q400 both flights were 5-7 minutes late. When I was web-check in I forgot the type of the aircraft and I checked a seat on the sun side. That is a problem because the aircraft has no shades. The service was excellent with very friendly staff but with an unfriendly / noisy aircraft.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,,,5,,True,
Olympic Air customer review,9,2012-09-24,Took a flight from Belgrade to Athens which was fairly empty.

Olympic Air customer review,10,2012-08-29,I have to admit to being somewhat concerned about booking Olympic Air but Aegean was very expensive in comparison. So I booked 2 tickets to/from Athens to Heraklion. The web-site was easy to navigate and the process simple. We did have one slight schedule change on our outbound flight which didn't affect our plans. We checked-in on-line the day before each flight and printed our boarding cards bag drop was easy to find and our bags were taken quickly. Boarding in Athens a bit late but we made up the time en route. Aircraft in both directions a Q-400 which was bright and clean. We didn't expect anything on-board but were surprised to be served a beverage and a packet of nuts/cookie. Cabin crew were well presented and couldn't do enough. All in all a great experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,
Olympic Air customer review,8,2012-08-24,I have just returned from Zante and I found that both flights were what I'd expect from any other company.

Olympic Air customer review,10,2012-07-16,Flew Mykonos to Athens with Olympic Air in Premium Economy. Check in was polite and efficient. Aircraft was clean inside and out had seat 3A.

A very comfortable flight and we landed on time. Would recommend Olympic Air and would choose them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,
Olympic Air customer review,2,2012-07-15,I am a Gold member in both Greek airlines (Aegean-Olympic Air) traveling over 100 times a year and I have to admit that Olympic Air is below expectations especially in Ground services (Lounges - Luggage priority services). They must: Renovate their Lounges in Athens Airport as soon as possible. Dramatically improve their Luggage priority service. Improve their unacceptable prices and value for money for local flights.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,
Olympic Air customer review,1,2012-07-02,"After an extreme delay in Milan on Aegean and missing my flight to Mykonos I was rebooked on Olympic Air. I took my new ticket and other Aegean info the Olympic counter to check in as I was told. I had been up all night with no sleep and after handing the agent the new tickets and my passport and my old Aegean ticket he literally threw it back at me and said ""you are flying Aegean not Olympic"" and rolled his eyes. After a deep breath I informed him I had been rebooked and he then asked why I didn't show him the new ticket in a nasty tone. I informed him I handed him the new ticket with my passport and if he took time he would have noticed. I asked him politely why he literally threw the papers at me even if I was flying with Aegean and if that was how he was trained to deal with the public. I also asked him if I needed a manager to check me in. Then after no apology he then checked me in and I was on my way. I go to Greece often and this experience is why I usually try to fly Aegean. The flight itself was a joke. They set up the beverage cart to serve two people (me and one other in front) and then took cart to back to breakdown. But everyone was nice except the ticket agent.",False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,
Olympic Air customer review,8,2011-12-09,Flew several legs Athens to Heraklion to Rhodes domestic as well as Athens Tirana international.

Olympic Air customer review,,2011-09-29,2 hour delay going out from Birmingham only to be told when we were up in the air that we would be landing in Greece to refuel and no one could provide us with an explanation. The plane was dirty with rubbish on the floor and in the back of seats chewing gum stuck to the side of the chair. They missed our meals out and we had to point it out staff throughout the flight were chewing which was unprofessional. On the return we were delayed for 15 hrs with no explanation what so ever we were given a 3.50 euro voucher. Instead of returning on 24th we returned on the 25th. We will not be travelling with them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Olympic Air customer review,9,2011-09-10,Despite the delay departure of 30 mins from Athens to Tirana due to system's break down the flight went smoothly.

Olympic Air customer review,10,2011-08-08,Athens-Kythira Island (ATH-KIT) on a Bombardier Dash-8-Q400 NextGen. This is a Public Obligation Service route in Greece and the price is reasonable (120 euros return ticket). The flight takes only 30-35 minutes.

Olympic Air customer review,7,2011-07-25,I found a good deal from Athens to Vienna return. I went on Airbus A319 (SX-OAF). The plane was clean the seat pitch good but not as good as the seat pitch of Boeing 737-300/400. The staff were friendly and the menu good. I returned on another A319. Was very full because Austrian Airlines cancelled their flight to Athens. The only problem is that they don't fly to destinations in Europe.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Olympic Air customer review,8,2011-07-14,ATH-AMS. Check in a breeze friendly ground staff and at the gate. Punctual departure candy given for departure and hot lunch and 2 rounds of drinks offered on this 3h10min flight. Young and friendly staff also showed interest in passengers and cared for flight safety. Flight was only half full but this airline is definitely a good deal nowadays both in price and service.

Check-in fast in Athens onboard service was great and surprised to get a meal on short flight. The only annoying thing - we checked in an hour and 45 minutes ahead in Chania (a bit early I know) and the staff were present but made all of us wait another 20 minutes until they opened the counter. Other than that we had a good experience with Olympic.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Olympic Air customer review,8,2010-12-14,EFL-ATH-LHR return. Can't fault a thing really good snacks and coffee served on the short hop to Athens a good hot lunch / dinner served by very attentive crew on LHR sectors seating comfortable with more than adequate leg room although some form of entertainment would have been appreciated. Service only slightly marred by being told by a crew member that they would only serve me two white wines as if I was some school child! All flights on time baggage delivery at LHR painfully slow though which needs some attention but not really the airlines fault.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Olympic Air customer review,,2010-12-09,AMS-MUC by Lufthansa - my flight AMS-KTM was cancelled due to weather. I was rerouted via Athens by Olympic. My two bags were not accepted by Olympic Air unless I paid 160 euro for the flight to Athens. The fact that Lufthansa had accepted the luggage made no difference. I refused to pay and had to call family to collect one of the bags. At the gate I was told that there was no meal for me. I got the lame excuse that my booking was made at the last minute. Had they told my while checking in I could at least have bought some sandwiches at Schiphol. After arrival in Athens and while checking in it became clear the my luggage was only labelled to Athens despite my request to label it all the way to KTM. My booking was all the way to KTM on one PNR. Filing a complaint with Olympic Air customer service produced a deafening silence. Beware of these amateurs!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,

Olympic Air customer review,2,2010-10-08,LHR-ATH route in Business Class (waste of money) with a nearly full dirty aircraft. Crew members huddling in the galley engaged in conversation that apparently could not be interrupted by offering any semblance of proper passenger service. Heard a lot of hype about the NEW Olympic but in reality was greatly unimpressed. After repeatedly using the call button and being ignored I went to the galley only to find a flight attendant eating from a meal tray and busily stuffing small liquor bottles into her purse. Lavatories not serviced and reeked. Avoid Olympic at all costs.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Olympic Air customer review,8,2010-09-07,Athens to Santorini on A320. Check in quite good. Used Goldair Lounge at Athens as I got in free with Diners Card.

Olympic Air customer review,5,2010-07-21,My daughter (10yrs) flew Paris to Zakynthos through Athens on 18th July with the unaccompanied services. She did tell me about the UM service in Athens - when she got there she was taken to a room with other children to wait 3 hours for the next flight. The staff in the room who was supposed to look after them smoked all the time. This is absolutely shocking to see the way they treat children.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Olympic Air customer review,10,2010-04-29,Economy Class LHR-ATH-EFL A320 & Dash 8-400. A huge improvement over the old Olympic Airlines.

Olympic Air customer review,9,2010-03-09,LCA-ATH-LCA flights were on time and enjoy the new look cabin. Food was acceptable with a sandwich and cereal for Breakfast and a Greek salad + roll for dinner on the return. Only annoyance is they changed the return from an A320 to an A319 so my pre-booked exit row seat ended up being just a normal seat and the seat ended up being broken did take me three attempts to get someone to move me.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Olympic Air customer review,8,2010-03-06,London Gatwick - Athens economy class. A320 everything from staff uniforms to the interior was new. The plane was equipped with PTV screens but no inflight movie or any form of entertainment offered during this 3+ hrs flight.

Olympic Air customer review,8,2009-12-21,CDG-ATH A320. Welcomed by a friendly crew seats quite comfortable. I was sitting one row behind the emergency exit and the cabin crew came to brief the passengers about the operation of the doors in case of emergency. Started =service with drinks and then a hot meal. After that more drinks as well as coffee or tea along with a box of chocolate cookies. Overall good service smiling crew and good value for money bearing in mind I booked the ticket a few days ago and the plane was nearly full. Still room for improvement though as there is still no in flight entertainment or a good magazine to keep the passengers busy.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Olympic Air customer review,7,2009-11-25,Delays are pathogenic to Olympic Air. ATH-TIA left with 25 minutes delay. The plane was a Q400 new but uncomfortable and noisy - had a window seat which was not reclining and there was no window shutter. Newspapers were not offered lunch was not offered on a tray but a plastic box with sandwich and a confection. After drinks / coffee they gave us box with cookies. Return with A319 change of equipment was probably because there was still a problem of delays. The aircraft did not have a business class area. We were offered newspapers (in the old way manner left on the galley to be picked up) but this time food offered on a tray - tasteless and indifferent. I could not complain but the service was not remarkable. The hostesses were all girls (there is clearly a problem with men stewards) friendly and more than helpful.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Olympic Air customer review,7,2009-11-06,"LHR-ATH new A320. Aircraft was clean but grey and gloomy. Food surprisingly good good coffee by airline standards. Service excellent. The return flight was another new A320 whose blue seats gave economy class a feeling of being a cut above budget-airline equivalents. Food and service of a high standard although trays could have been cleared away sooner - and the aircraft was rather warm. Check-in for both flights was a breeze. Olympic Air has made a promising start with a new impression of efficiency that will be a revelation to anyone familiar with its predecessor. But London to Athens is a most competitive routes and at the moment Aegean still edges it offering in-flight entertainment where OA had none (a surprising omission) and its own magazine (aside from a one-off souvenir magazine commemorating OA's heritage OA's magazine is in fact that of the parent company MIG beefed up with OA-specific content and is in Greek only). Furthermore the frequent plugging of MIG's other brands was seriously off-putting even it did mean free biscuits promoting its food arm. Hearing ""Thank you flying Olympic Air part of Marfin Investment Group"" at the end of the flight is a surefire way to drain the glamour out of the Olympic brand name and any remaining romance out of flying altogether. Nobody loves a conglomerate so a bit more subtlety would go a long way. I'll keep my eye on OA in the future but for the time being will probably continue to choose Aegean for this route.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
