"""unfair policy towards its customers""",1,2020-08-19,"Since March 16th trying to get refund for our April ticket to Madeira and back, via Flightfinder who, so far, has provided all the necessary info that we have asked them about, but Binter Canarias keeps refusing their responsibility and keeps sending our requests back to Flightfinder.  We liked this airline but this is just unfair policy towards its customers.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,,July 2020,,,,,1,,False,
"""four months to get my money back""",1,2020-07-30,"Tenerife to Lanzarote. The airline cancelled the flight the days before and now I'm fighting since nearly four months to get my money back, that's 100% illegal and against the European passenger rights.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tenerife to Lanzarote,April 2020,,,,,1,,False,
"""Don't recommend this airline""",2,2020-02-20,One of our suitcases was damaged. Zips and locks were torn off. Not sure why they had to do that because our suitcase was TSA friendly. We only found out that the zips were completely damaged after we got to our hotel. I emailed them about the situation. Sent them photos etc. Then I got a generic response that someone would get back to me. Then nothing. I emailed them several more times and no response. Very unprofessional. Don't recommend this airline.,True,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tenerife to Funchal via Gran Canaria,January 2020,1,2,,1,2,,False,
"""Excellent airline""",10,2020-02-19,"Tenerife Norte to Gran Canaria. Excellent airline, clean and new plane.

"""check-in easy and smooth""",10,2016-05-14,"âœ… Verified Review | Lanzarote to Lisbon via Gran Canaria with Binter Canarias. Great airline. First flight with an ATR later a CRJ to Lisbon. Check-in easy and smooth. Connection LPA easy. Both flights great staff. Nice smile. Service on the first flight water and a cookie, second flight a chooice of a snackbox: sweet / tapas / mix. We had the tapas served with canarian red wine, water and later a coffee. Second glass of wine served. Great FA, nice plane as seated 2-2 and uneventfull flight.

"""friendly cabin crew""",9,2016-03-02,"Excellent flights from Gran Canaria to Tenerife North with this super regional airline. Well maintained, clean aircraft both ways. Short flights of around 30 mins, with friendly cabin crew. Newspapers brought round before take off. During the flight served glass of water with a chocolate biscuit, followed by a sweet. Just enough time to collect everything in before landing. Check in easy with no queing at both LPA and TFN. Luggage delivered on belt within 5 mins of entering baggage reclaim,at both airports. Thank you Binter Canarias for excellent service.",False,ATR 72,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LPA to TFN,February 2016,4,5,,5,5,,True,

Binter Canarias customer review,8,2014-01-10,Flew from Lisbon to Las Palmas on 29th December. Wasn't exactly sure what to expect from such a small airline. The CRJ200 plane was fine albeit somewhat dated. Service on board was very efficient with a nice spread of snacks for a 1h45m flight. I would definitely fly with them again! A good airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
Binter Canarias customer review,8,2013-11-07,"Flew from Gran Canaria (Las Palmas) to Tenerife North airport. Flight time was about 20 mins in a small ATR-72 aircraft. Legroom was minimal I'm 6'5"" and would not have managed much more than 20mins! Hand-luggage space is limited although your ticket entitles you to 6kg of hand-luggage and a further 20kg of checked-in luggage. The flight time is long enough for cabin crew to serve a cup of water and give you a complimentary biscuit not much but more than most airlines give these days! Flight left 20mins late this was due to air traffic control problems. If you're island-hopping it does the job!",False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,4,,True,
Binter Canarias customer review,10,2013-09-25,FNC-LPA-FNC. Again perfect service very professional and attentive flight attendants however not overly friendly. Having a small bread with cheese plus their traditional dried fruit is a nice touch. Planes are ATR though the flights are very comfortable and not too much noisier than Airbus.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,,,5,,True,
Binter Canarias customer review,10,2011-07-31,Funchal to Lanzarote via Las Palmas and back. The flights were on time crew smiling and served a snack between Funchal and Las Palmas - which for a flight of about 1 hr 30 mins was a treat. Gran Canaria airport is busy all the time but actually it is very easy and simple to use.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Binter Canarias customer review,7,2011-06-04,FUE-LPA: Booked this as a part of a TUI holiday package. They booked me on FUE-LPA with Binter and then on their own airline TUIfly from LPA to MUC. I tried to check in at the Binter Counter in FUE the day before. Staff reasonably friendly and efficient but not a lot of English skills. They checked me through to TUIfly to MUC. Flight was delayed for around 35 minutes. No announcement about delay was made. When the late aircraft arrived they made people board as fast as possible. Flight was on an ATR which seemed well maintained and had comfortable leather seats. Catering water and chocolate bar fine for this short hop. Transferring in LPA is easy although passengers possibly could easily miss the sign for connecting flights.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Binter Canarias customer review,,2007-01-03,I fly regularly with Binter between Las Palmas and Tenerife. I find the airline generally punctual (except for extreme weather conditions - usually at Tenerife North) and the staff very attentive. Fares can be pricey but if you choose your flight times during the day you can get some good deals. Occasionally I have flown with Islas Airways but have found them unreliable and subject to flight cancellations which has been most inconvenient. Their ground staff also tend to be uncommunicative.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Binter Canarias customer review,,2005-08-28,Binter Canarias is a reliable no frills inter island commuter service. There is really not much more to add! I have used them frequently and there is little to elaborate about this basic commuter service.!,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
