"""Crews were friendly""",9,2019-09-23,"Nairobi Wilson to Samburu with Safarilink. The whole operation looked routined, safe and efficient to me. The aircraft is the most widely-used bushplane in Africa it seems, although there are other types used on different routes. The aisle is very narrow, but once you have made it to the front (best seats for visibility, you are ok. No food service, but water bottles available. The baggage goes in an underbelly hold, hand luggage has room in the rear of the cabin. Crews were friendly. The only complaint I, being a hobby photographer, have is the dirty plexiglass windows, which are also tinted to make matters worse.",True,Cessna Grand Caravan,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Nairobi Wilson to Samburu,September 2019,4,1,,4,3,,True
"""pleasant way to reach the coast""",7,2015-11-13,"Short one hour flights with Safarilink to Diani from Nairobi Wilson, return. A very pleasant way to reach the coast from Nairobi and much quicker overall than the JKIA Nairobi Airport to Mombasa route. Drink and  biscuit served. Both airports were small, indeed Diani is described as an airstrip.",False,Dash 8/100,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Nairobi to Diani,November 2015,3,3,,3,2,,True
