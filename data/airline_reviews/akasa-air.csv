"""Spent around 14 hours in the airport""",2,2022-11-12,"Never be flying with 'Akasa Air' again I am a frequent traveller and the experience below is my worse airline experience so far! We booked 2 tickets (different PNR), one was on my name - Ashima Arora and the other was on my husbands name - Nishan Singh. My infant ticket was attached to my husbands PNR. My husband couldn't travel because of some personal reasons. We (Myself and My infant) reached the Akasa Air counter on time (10am it was and the flight was at 11am), my boarding pass was also printed but when the staff realized that my infant was added in a different PNR, he asked me to wait and tried calling the supervisor/manager to check what needs to be done in this case. I was standing there for 30 minutes and constantly reminding the staff about the moving clock. However, he assured me that I need not worry as they'll have me onboard. After 30 minutes at 10:30am, the staff told me that I need to pay Rs1500 to move my child's name in my PNR number from my husbands PNR. I tried to find out the real reason behind the charges as there are airlines that do not charge for it if it has to be from one parent to another parent. It was 10:32am. I took 1 minute to absorb those charges and told the counter staff that I'll pay as I want to board that flight. It was 10:33am. He called someone again (I believe it was a supervisor standing on the boarding gate) in front of me that the passenger was ready to pay now, but the person on the other side refused to take the payment and have us board the flight. So, the staff took 30 minutes to inform me about the next step but did not spare even 3 minutes of time to let me absorb those extra charges I had to pay (for PNR move). We were left there and couldn't board that flight. I waited for the supervisor/manager for another 1 hour and 30 minutes but no one showed up even the staff informed them that the passenger was waiting. I was left with no other choice and I reached out to the airport authority with the concern. When the staff of airport authority accompanied me, only then the supervisor showed up. He started giving some lame excuses that I was already late for the flight at 10:30am and I reached late to the airport. Since they have very less number of flights operational and haven't even tied up with any other airline, they could only place me in the next day flight. And now, I had to pay Rs1500 for moving the infant's name and Rs2000 extra to secure my seat for the next day. And these charges were for one-side travel. Similarly, for the way back from Kochi to BNG I again paid Rs1500 for the infant. I actually had to pay double i.e. Rs6000 which is higher than my ticket's original price for my infant. And additionally Rs2000 more for my ticket too. Spent around 14 hours in the airport with my infant. Lost a day of hotel booking charges too since we were flying for holidays and the holiday package was already booked. When I wrote this concern to their customer support, initially I started getting response with as if I have connected to the wrong team with the concern. After writing to then a number of times, I got a response saying that all fault was of us as passengers and thus, they can't help in any which means without letting me know their source of collecting the facts or the information. The resistance was very clear in the emails I received from the customer care too.",True,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangalore to Kochi,October 2022,3,4,,1,1,,False,
"""Boarding is entire chaos""",3,2022-11-09,"I travelled twice within a span of three weeks. Positives: - Inflight service is good - Staff is courteous in flight - Baggage comes on time. Negatives: - Boarding is entire chaos, they dont know how to even organise boarding from gate. - Flight is divided into zones where zone 2,3 and 4 can board early to avoid congestion but no one announces this! Check in staff horrendous - I specifically asked for my paintings to be put the Fragile tag but they didn't put it with the result one of them was destroyed.",True,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Bengaluru,November 2022,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,3,,False,1
"""this airline is always late""",1,2022-11-06,"I don't know where to start, this airline is always late. Akasa is undoubtedly known for the delays it causes, mainly by a few hours and sometimes even almost a day. Akasa gave 1 hour time before the departure, as its boarding time, which is atrocious. Today, I was on the way to the airport, when I received a last moment notification stating the delay of my flight QP 1314 by an hour, which was still okay at that point. The madness began when I reached the airport and was lined in the queue for checking in my luggage when the Akasa employees started pulling out other passengers from another flight that had begun boarding. On finally reaching the counters after over half an hour, the ground staff refused to take my luggage as the Departure time was 3.30 pm after the delay, and the ""boarding"" mentioned by them was 2.30 pm and the time was 2.32 pm. They refused the baggage, and I had to run through security with 15kg of luggage, which had 2 bottles of alcohol. Upon finally reaching the gate, the flight was mentioned delayed again. The boarding did not start before 3.20 pm.",True,,Business,Economy Class,Bangalore to Ahmedabad,October 2022,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,False,1
