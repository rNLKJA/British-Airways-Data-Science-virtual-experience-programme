"""hands off the worst airline""",1,2022-11-17,"United is hands off the worst airline. I was traveling to visit my fiancé for thanksgiving. And I had just finished my last final in medical school so I was really happy but United ruined it. It all started when I tried checking in my bag. I am a United credit card holder so logically my first bag is supposed to be free. I tried adding the bag through the app but it kept charging me. So I contacted the customer service who requested me to seek help at the airport kiosk or the staff and reassured that it should be an easy fix. I agreed to it. When I sought help at the airport, the staff including the supervisor proceeds to tell me that I bought my flight with my miles so I am not eligible to check in my bag for free even though I am a card member. I tell them that the customer service rep confirmed that none of that should be a problem. They tell me to bring an email stating that. Now where am I supposed to find an email? I call the customer service again. Again, this is happening an hour and a half prior to my flight. The customer service rep tells me it shouldn’t be a problem. Miles are considered rewards not punishment. I try to hand over the phone to the United staff at MIA and they refuse to talk to him. They keep saying they want to see an email. The customer service rep tells me he can’t send any email other than a generic one per the airline policy. So the United staff at MIA leaves me at that without any help. The customer service rep tells me that I should just pay for the bag and request a refund later. As much as I didn’t want to go through the whole process of requesting a refund and all that, I agreed to it it because I didn’t want to let this ruin my day. Then, I head over to TSA, the nice lady checks my boarding pass and points me to the general line. But this man comes in and asks me to get my ID out before I even enter the line. Note that, there is a huge line at TSA (I am no where close to the TSA guy). I tell him that I have it right here in my hand’s reach but he won’t let me enter the line unless he sees it in my hand. I tell him the line is so long and I don’t want to drop it. Still, he won’t let me go in until he sees my ID in my hand. I have flown so many times in my entire life and I never had anyone stop me at the beginning of line and manhandled me like this. Then at TSA screen, their machine breaks and they lose my mac. I end up finding it in another lane. oh also, my flight gets delayed. I am not exaggerating. This is all happening in the same day. Once I get in the flight, the flight goes smoothly. But now I am worried because the arrival time is too close to the departure time of my connecting flight. Even after everything happened, I was hopeful that United will do its due diligence like every other airline, and hold the flight for at least 10min because that should be enough to get the passengers in from the delayed flight. Also, perhaps that the crew members would help these passengers out first to accommodate the delay. I am sorry but that just has been my experience with American and southwest. They just understood and helped. Little things but made a huge difference. But United did not do any of those. They had zero communications and did not make accommodations. Couple other passengers and I ran 30 gate gates over in 10min just do find that they closed the gate even though there is 10min left, means there was no communication about the delayed flight.

It was to be our very first time in Paris. We only had 6 days available, so we wanted to make the most of it.

Eventually they realized that they would not be able to board us electronically, so they did it manually. It was utter chaos, like the blind leading the blind.

"""United is literally washing their hands of this issue""",1,2022-10-13,"I have been a member of United for more than 10 years and have the United credit card as well. This flight was $2300, so not cheap. My return flight to SFO was originally scheduled on 7/27/2002, but due to strikes in Germany by Lufthansa covering the Athens-Frankfurt trip (UA 9312), I ended up being stranded with my daughter near Athens airport for 3 days. When going to the counter at airport to rebook one day before, it took me 7 hours on 7/26/2002 at the Lufthansa airport counter to get a new ticket. Lufthansa gave us a voucher for a hotel 30 min away from the city, with nothing to do around. Return trip was a complete nightmare. First at check-in, after 1.5 hours to get to check-in attendant, I am told I cannot check in my luggage until my final destination and that when they rebooked my ticket, they made a mistake and put my daughter as an infant instead of a teenager. We flew back on three different airlines from different alliances, which led to terminal changes both at CDG and JFK. This gave me no time for getting my luggage which ended up being stuck in France for three days. Under federal law, if an airline cancels a flight I am entitled to a full refund. United took two months to respond to basically deny any kind of compensation, since that law only applies to domestic flight. For my daughters trip, she had a round-trip starting from Athens and she was supposed to return to Athens. After this fiasco, we decided to cancel the return ticket. As of today, months later, we did not get refunded for the return, nor any compensation for the strike either. United is literally washing their hands of this issue and put all the blame on LH. What is the point of an alliance if they relinquish their responsibility to them. They should compensate me and negotiate themselves with LH. Here is the meagre and only email received from United Customer Care Team after working on my case for 2 months. They sure work slowly. Stopping business with this airline: ""I am sorry to hear your flight was cancelled with our Star Alliance partners at Lufthansa due to strikes in Germany.

I have been and still is working in Customer service ALL my 20+ years. And in all of those years working with 2 different big companies I was trained the VALUE of CUSTOMER SERVICE.

Just like what they advertised on their website? Well, It SURELY DID NOT happen to my family, as all 4 of us are seated on 4 DIFFERENT ROWS!! Is it not the reason Airlines have personnel working behind their computer to make sure that when an issue such as this arises they are there to fix it?? (Could it be their tactics to force you to pay extra money?) I have asked in multiple occasions the United Airlines personnel behind the computer to kindly seat us family together or at least myself and my 2 kids, as it will be hard for the kids, myself, as well as the one who will be seating beside them. Unfortunately, the 3 ladies kept brushing off my concern, so I have asked to speak with the supervisor but I was told that there was no supervisor on duty as it was the last flight? So then I asked for the one in-charge on that shift but she repeatedly told me ""that My family are on economy seats and they CAN NOT do anything and that I should have paid for a preferred seats!"".

We had 2 destinations (DC and Zurich) that we would be landing at before then which was a total time frame of around 16 hours. Due to this my wife was unable to keep many of her things that she needed for the long flight.

They made me feel like a convict rather than a customer who paid for their services. My daughter and I made the mistake of flying with United from Newark, NJ, to Munich. It was a disaster right from the start. During online check-in I realized that you couldn’t choose your seat. My daughter and I were conveniently assigned two seats in the middle of a 4-seat row. The only way to get out was to pay extra, and not too little. This is pure blackmail! I already paid heftily for our tickets and simply couldn’t afford to pay more. Nor did I expect to. I guess I'm spoiled. Problems and tension continued on the ground. When we were checking in our bags, a United employee in charge couldn’t answer a single question we had and just grumpily pointed her finger at the check-in kiosk. It appeared that she couldn’t speak English at all and had no clue about the check-in process. Boarding was performed in the ‘Meet the Parents’ style, with group numbers and very strict rules on who goes where, how and when. When our group was finally called, the passengers were told to form 2 lines. One of them was going faster and I had the audacity to switch to it. That was a huge offense to the supervising employee (who actually did nothing at all before he noticed me and didn’t care that there were 4 people in one line and 40 in the other one). He forced me back into the initial line and, to teach me a lesson, invited 5-7 people ahead of me to switch to the shorter line. I asked him if this was really necessary because I ended up ahead of them thanks to his ‘lesson’. He just snarled at me and withdrew with a job-well-done air. Right before the airplane door, they suddenly forced us to check in our carry-ons (that United allows on international flights), claiming that there was no more room on the plane. I told them that our bags were quite small and that we had a very tight connection in Munich. Should our carry-ons be lost, we’d have no basic stuff to survive for a couple of days. But that didn’t convince them. What’s worse, they didn’t give us any time to remove our valuables from the carry-ons. We had to decide within seconds, on the floor right in front of the plane door and under unkind supervision of boarding personnel. As I was franticly going through my carry-on to salvage my computer, an employee yelled at me ‘You wanna fly? Gimme that bag!’ Some service. Our carry-ons did make it to Munich. However, ALL of my underwear (used and new) was missing from mine. This is the craziest thing I have ever experienced! And I have no illusions about reimbursement.

Our airline of choice for the trip was American Airlines. We got to Cabo with no problems, on time and had excellent service from American. The vacation was awesome. Everything was great with our trip until we got to the airport for our return trip home.

The ticket agent said we could fly out on an earlier United Airlines flight to Houston, have a longer lay over and get home later than planned, but we would get home by midnight. We decided to go with United. Big mistake. Initially when we checked in for American, we pre-paid our checked bags. American wasn’t set up to refund our pre-paid checked bags, we were flying another airline, so I get having to pay for checked bags again for United, but it still peeved my off. Although we had boarding passes printed by American, we were directed to the automated kiosk to check in for United. We did. Then we went to the counter. They did the same thing we did in the automated kiosk. Exactly the same things. This slowed us up and we had to rush to make the flight.

We rebooked our flight 24-hours later and were told to go to customer serviced for boarding passes and vouchers for hotel rooms in Houston.

It was a pain in the butt to try to get my bag back the next day, but because they knew where it was, it was able to be done. Everyone I talked to both on the United and Air Canada side could not give me any information along the way and it was never scanned or documented. But at the end of the day I got my bag back. Now on the way back, I had a connecting flight in Vancouver, and there was a plane delay. That happens all the time - I travel for work so I'm constantly on planes, and the delays do not bother me. This delay however caused me to miss my connection, so I had to be rebooked from Vancouver to Chicago with another connecting flight through Denver. I triple asked and was reassured that my bag would follow me to Chicago and that they would reroute it. I was not allowed to pass customs until my bag was confirmed in Vancouver, so I know it at least made it to Vancouver. When I got to Chicago (at 2:00 a.m. the next day instead of the 8:00 p.m. the previous day as I was expecting), it was clear that my bag could not made it with me. I submitted a file reference number, and was told my bag would get to me either tomorrow or the next day. The things in my bag are for work, so I need them to do my job and I am at a major disadvantage not having them. Since then, I called on Saturday as well as multiple times on Sunday and now it is Monday and I've called three or four times today as well. I almost never leave reviews and I almost never call as much as I have, but my confidence in their ability to get my bag back as extremely low. Every single person I've talked to (And I've talked to people in both United and Air Canada) has first said that they don't know where the bag is and then after I insist that it made it to Vancouver, they put me on a hold and then come back and confirm that it is definitely in Vancouver and they just need to have it released by Air Canada. Everyone I've talked to has been very polite, but nothing has really been helpful in getting my bag back. They've said that they need to contact Air Canada to get them to release the bag to send to Chicago. I have now been told this four times. Two of those four times they put me on a hold to contact Vancouver and then came back maybe 3 minutes later to say they couldn't get a hold of anyone so they'll message them to release the bag. The only flight to Chicago leaving Vancouver is in 2 hours from now and I'm not very confident that my bag will make it on that flight which means I'm going to be SOL for work tomorrow. My bag is literally just sitting there in Vancouver and no one can seem to figure out how to get it on a plane. It's located, we know where it is, we know how to get it back to me, but it's just not happening. I recognize that United is trying to get back on their feet after the craziness of the last few years and they have limited staff. And I totally emphasize with that. On the other hand, it should be an easy interaction to figure this out and it wouldn't take very long. No one can seem to explain to me why it's an issue to take 3 days to get Air Canada to release the bag (And I'm not even very confident that that is the issue, since after talking to Air Canada that doesn't seem to be the problem) to send to Chicago, and still no end in sight.

Unfortunately, ""10-15 minutes more"" became the anthem for the next four hours while we remained in the plane or wandering the tarmac, hoping that finally we could go home. At around 3:30 pm, they finally informed us that it was certain that the flight was canceled and the next flight would only go out at 11:15 am the next morning.

This cost us an entire day of income and it is already difficult to organize a trip together due to the fact that we have two daughters in college with different schedules. After deplaning and taking out all of hand-carry luggage, we were made to wait 1 extra hour just for our luggage, which never even left Paris as we never did, to come. Then, we waited in line for another few hours to receive our new boarding passes and information for the hotel where they would put us up. They also expected us to use the airport shuttle that stopped relatively far from the hotels when most of the passengers on the flight had a lot of luggage that we were made to drag and walk with by ourselves. We ended up having to pay for a taxi to take us to and from the hotel because it would have taken us even longer and would have been quite a hassle.

"""I will never travel with United again""",1,2022-08-04,"To begin, an incompetent United associate scheduled a 52-minute layover at O’Hare Airport. When I discovered the flight change 3 months later they refused to deal with me, even though I was the passenger, and would only talk to my travel agent. They failed to notify me that they changed my flight to something unfeasible. 52 minutes to change flights at O’Hare? Eventually, I was able to get it changed. The two passengers in my row for my transatlantic flight were a 6-hour & 15-minute nightmare. I sat next to a big man who used my leg space, even to the point of touching my leg with his the entire night. I never slept. His continuous loud yawns and his arm and elbow into my seat space didn’t help. Next to him was a younger guy who appeared to be sick. I thought he was going to throw up, but he just burped/hiccuped very loudly for most of the flight. The flight attendants had to constantly ask him to move his legs and feet, which wasn't easy, especially when they repeatedly had trouble waking him when they tried to move the cart down the aisle. Why didn’t the flight attendants notice either passenger and do something? Months before departure I called United with my request for vegetarian fare. Incredulously, the flight attendants asked every passenger if they wanted the cheeseburger or veggie burger on the return flight so that, by the time they got to me, there was only one left. When I told the flight attendant I had preordered, she replied, coldly, “There’s no pre-ordering.” If this is true, why does United offer the ability to do so? The guy behind me was not as fortunate as I. Despite having pre-ordered, they had no vegetarian meals left. Needless to say, he was very upset as he ended up not eating. Why was this allowed to happen? What is the purpose of enabling you to request a dietary choice in advance if it will not be honored, especially after everyone else on the plane is given a choice that ultimately exhausts the supply of that which you ordered? Flight from Newark to San Diego--I had to endure a screaming, crying baby, which began before the flight began and lasted for the entire flight. Every few minutes throughout the flight, this baby/toddler would let out with a high-pitched scream that was painful. Never mind why the parents would inflict this torture on fellow passengers—why would United Airlines? Why didn’t United take action? This 6-hour & 55-minutes was pure torture. Again, United personnel looked the other way. I tore my used anti-bacterial wipe to stuff in each ear. It might have helped a little, but the pieces of paper were not earplugs, so I spent most of the long flight holding them pushed into my ears with my fingers. On the same flight, there was a rude stewardess. She chose to ignore me instead of answering my question when I asked her where she was going with my bag that I had stowed over my row before I sat. For some reason, she moved it down the aisle. Would it have been so difficult to reply when I asked her calmly where she was taking it? Instead, she just gave me an unfriendly look and continued. When the plane was in the air, the cart moved down the aisle to offer drinks, she and another stewardess decided not to offer me a drink, even though they gave them to the people sitting next to me.

My vacation to Hawaii was tainted by this experience, and I will never fly with this airline again. Due to made up excuses that were thrown around which included “staffing issues,” “mechanical issues,” “work hours,” and “fueling purposes,” all the passengers of this flight were upset because United toyed around with its passengers and kept giving us false hope about getting us to Hawaii. Around hour 10, United decided to pass out free waters and snacks; these were expired granola bars and fruit snacks.  Finally, we thought there was hope when the Captain of the aircraft came and made a grand speech about how he’ll get to our destination for sure that evening. He even received a standing ovation and cheers. We still waited 2 additional hours after that. Then when we finally were able to board the plane, the stewardess threatened all the passengers saying that if we do not board under a certain amount of time, we would not be able to fly out to Hawaii. This is when I knew we were never getting out of there. All 300 passengers worked together to quickly board the plane. The plane just taxied for a half hour around the runway and made an abrupt announcement that his staff could unboard. Then, the captain lectured the passengers that we essentially ran out of time and could not fly. We were all held in the plane for another thirty minutes until we could unboard. They would not let us exit because the customer service line was already way too long. Apparently there were more United flights that had issues. When we finally were released, there was a massive line at customer service. Workers did not know what was going on, and lied and said they ran out of hotel vouchers because they did not want to deal with the long line. Those who were lucky enough to receive some kind of voucher got hotel rooms (instead of cots they offered for use in the airport) and none of the meal vouchers worked. We were finally able to fly out to Maui the following morning; of course it was delayed by two hours.

It (Dublin to Chicago) was delayed because of loading luggage, and also because there was no headset for cockpit to communicate to ground crew so we could push back. So we were an hour late into Chicago. We had a 1 1/2 hour lay over in Chicago. We got to the gate in time but when the attendant scanned our passes, we were told there was no ""Clarks"" on this flight, We had automatically been rebooked on a later flight and our seats had been given away (to whom I don't think United should rebook people on a later flight without giving them a chance to make the flight first (unless it has already taken off). We got on the flight from Chicago to LA, the one we were originally scheduled for, on stand by status, but because there had only been about 15 minutes between the flights by the time we landed and deplaned, our luggage did not make it. My husband and I were unable to sit together and the flight was uncomfortable the whole time to LA. United announced on the plane that we could track our luggage on their app, it wasn't working. We went to the baggage desk at baggage return, and arranged our luggage to be delivered. My husband got an email saying it would be delivered at 9:30 the next morning (July 3), so we waited at home all day. 1 pm he called United, they said it was on a truck and tried to contact delivery company. My husband was told by United that it would be delivered some time this evening (July 3). When he asked what that meant, he was told by 6 pm. At 8;30 pm, we still didn't have our luggage, so he called United again, this time they could not reach delivery company. July 4th we got another email saying it was on the truck, with a link to track our luggage, it was not working well either as it showed the driver all over the place and there was no way he could have gotten from place to place that fast, impossibility. My husband texted the driver but got no response from him. About 2 pm, my husband called United again, and we were told that the driver still had 75 stops between him and us and our luggage would be delivered before 10 pm.

I will start with airline itself which while bearing United Express is operated by Mesa which does flights as United Express up and down the east coast in the E175 and other aircrafts. When I was boarding the plane boarding was fairly easy and we were told ahead of time that there would be limited service and bags would most likely need to be checked on the aircraft as it was a full flight. I don't remember how many bags were checked but it was a lot. Upon boarding we were all given santaizing wipes, and boy did I need one for my particular seat 4A as it was not particularly clean on the windowshade, tray table, plastics, and air controls, why does everyone insist on putting their dirty fingers on everything? Anyways, the seats around me were cleaner by the looks of it. I was just unlucky and I couldn't trade with another first class traveller as no one wanted to move. The seat featured a socket, an adjustable head rest, and a lot of padding (can't say the same for economy and I am glad I upgraded early on as the flight filled last second.) The seat was quite comfortable with a lot of pitch and recline for a regional jet. Enough about the seat, lets move on to service. Initially, we were told there would be no service, however more on that In a bit. On the ground we started off with orange juice and water as well as the complimentary COVID bags United is still giving out with Pretzels, Nuts, a stroopwafel, and water. Unfortunately, the flight attendant in the front managed to spill some orange juice on the tray she was serving from and the plastic cups were wet at the bottom, I really shouldn't have taken the water as it dripped on me and the drink holder that was also attached to the seat. She did apologize about that as the previous crew had managed to shove things into the compartments making it impossible not to spill. She then afterwards proceeded with the safety briefing and collected the trash before we took off. Once in the air service did improve for First as she had to delay the in-flight service a bit due to the captain thinking there would be more turbulence than there actually was, again more on that in a bit. She managed to serve first class with both alcoholic beverages and regular ones as usual, however she referred to everyone by our names, guess it was passed along somehow. Very professional.

The flights from Jacksonville to Chicago and from D.C. to Jacksonville were great, and the meal box my dad and I shared from Jacksonville to Chicago was delicious. The flights from Chicago to St. Louis and from St. Louis to D.C. were unfortunately more lackluster compared to the prior two. This is really only because the seats on the planes they were on were tiny and my dad and I were squished together like sardines despite the seating being in a 2-2 configuration.

On the planes my dad couldn’t buckle his seatbelt all the way due to his size and he needed a seatbelt extender. Now despite him being a bigger person, he’s never had an issue with seatbelts fitting him on airplanes and he has flown quite a bit in his life. I’m a decent bit smaller than he is and even I had to squeeze a bit to fit in the seatbelt, and beyond that the seats were just uncomfortable in general. Now the planes for these flights were operated by a regional airline so naturally they were smaller. I’ve since checked United’s fleet and I’m pretty certain that both of the planes were CRJ 550s. However everything else about these flights were great and the first flights I mentioned were on bigger jets so the seats were much more comfortable. The flight crew was polite and attentive and once again the food on the flight from Jacksonville to Chicago was great! Another positive was when we got off the plane at D.C., we had to come off the plane using the stairs not the “tunnel” (I don’t know the technical term) for some reason.

Economy Plus was well worth the price for these 5-hour flights! The seats are comfortable, especially if you bring a blanket and a small pillow for your lower back. They gave us small, thin blankets that are great to roll up and use as support for your neck/head. Pretzels, soda, and water are free. They sell basic meals that you pay for with a payment method you must indicate before the flight; they don’t accept cash or credit cards on board; it’s an entirely contactless system. There was no WiFi available because we were flying over the Pacific ocean, but there was free entertainment (movies, games) accessible via your phone/tablet/laptop. There are USB charging outlets between the seats, and you need to share the 2 plugs among the 3 seated passengers in your row. On both flights, all crew members were great. The flight attendants were permanently available, very efficient and friendly. On the return flight, right before closing the doors for departure, the Captain stood at the front of the cabin and made a warm welcome-aboard announcement that set the tone for an enjoyable travel experience. Because of the excellent flight and cabin crew, these flights in Economy Plus were a huge improvement compared to my two previous United flights in January when I flew in Business (PTY-HIA) and in First (HIA-SFO) class and at that time felt disappointed. I think I’ll stick to Economy Plus from now on, because ultimately what makes the difference is the crew, not the type of (expensive premium!) cabin you pay for. The only reason I’m not rating these two flights a 10 out of 10 is that I think United should give at least a _token_ extra snack to Economy Plus passengers. An important note about SFO: right now there are massive issues with staffing shortages and construction blockages at this airport. I got my boarding pass on-line and pre-paid for my checked bag, so at the airport I only needed to print the bag tag at a kiosk and drop off my suitcase, which was quick. The terminal was like a chaotic human beehive of stressful activity. For over 1 hour I was in a haphazardly-moving line that at times blocked access to offices and lounges, snaked around escalators, etc., with almost no guidance from staff, before I reached the entrance to the beginning of the usual line for the Security Screening area. I arrived at the airport 3 hours before departure, hoping to have my usual time to kick back and enjoy a sit-down meal and a beer before the flight, but I came out of Security with only 25 minutes to spare before the flight started boarding.

The desk attendant was extremely rude and only escalated the situation when some people got a bit angry, which was totally understandable. Then we sat on the bus for 30 minutes for no apparent reason. We were finally wheels up five and a half hours after we were supposed to depart, so most of us had spent over eight hours at the airport. The only apology we received was from the captain. I obviously missed my connection to Des Moines, so spend another three hours in Denver waiting for a later connection. Finally boarded, spent forever on the tarmac waiting to take off. The air vents were so loud and the loudspeaker wasn't working, so I couldn't hear any of the safety briefing or any announcements on the plane. When we landed, we pulled up to de-board, then turned around and sat in the middle of the tarmac. There was a thunderstorm going on. At this point the thunderstorm was projected to keep going for hours and I was about to pee my pants so I got up to see if I could use the restroom. I walked up to it and before I even had to chance to ask the flight attendant, she yelled at me that we were on an ""active"" landing area and I must return to my seat NOW.

When asked why they were so expensive, we were instead shamed for being Basic Economy customers. We were supposed to arrive at Newark Liberty for our connecting flight, but instead we were diverted to Baltimore because of storms in the New York area. The weather is obviously not United's fault, but the only help we got was from another rude kiosk agent who would only answer questions about our canceled flight to Newark and not about our connection to Shannon. Just as a side note, we arrived in Baltimore at 11:15pm. the agents words verbatim were ""I know you didn't ask to fly here but I didn't ask for you to come to my hometown either!"". Airlines would normally give you a pre-booked hotel voucher, but all we got after 3 hours at the BWI kiosk was a $130 voucher where we had to find and book a hotel ourselves. The next morning, we were finally told about our connecting flight from Newark to Shannon by the BWI kiosk staff, but it wasn't even good news. Instead, we learned that we had been booked onto a flight to Shannon from Newark the day after we were due to arrive in Newark! We ended up begging the United staff once again to get back the seats that we had booked, and all we were given were standby tickets that would maybe, just maybe, put us on the flight we had booked if anyone else couldn't make that journey. Luckily, we were notified later on that we were booked back onto that flight. But wait, that's not the end of it! My brother and I checked our luggage in when boarding onto the initial flights, and when we finally arrived in Ireland, we were shocked to find that my suitcase had severe damage to one of its wheels and my mum's Microsoft Surface Pro was covered in cracks.

"""hit with significant delays for various reasons""",4,2022-05-24,"It is clear to us that United Airlines has heavy logistic issues. For this trip, we had 7 flight-legs for which 5 of them were hit with significant delays (1h+) for various reasons ranging from weather, missing airplane, waiting for missing passengers or regulation (crew that did not have sufficient rest time). Our final flight was cancelled after 7h wait (3h connection + 4h sliding delay). And finally, one of our luggage did not follow. We were lucky that we selected our flights with high connection layovers. The staff at United are very courteous and helpful. We had many opportunities to test out the customer service and we have nothing to complain about on that front. Of course, they tried to blame the cancellation on weather to avoid covering the hotel, but armed with the United App (very good app), we had real time info on the specifics. Note, United gives a generous 10$US voucher for food in a 30h delay. Still, the app has some glitch, a reroute of luggage (after the cancelled leg) gave us a lot of worries when we suddenly saw that no checked in luggage was associated to that flight).

In a panic, we tried to work with the Airline agent who told us that there were no more flights to Puerto Plata that day. We would have to get a hotel and fly the next day (Saturday) causing us to miss a full day of our scheduled vacation. We were able to reserve 2 seats on a 10am flight from Newark to Santo Domingo for the same day in hopes of still making it to our final destination on Friday, but a few hours later. The airline agent handled this for us in Pittsburgh. Suddenly, the plane was able to leave a bit earlier than expected and the hope was that we may be able to catch our original connecting flight. We figured maybe we catch it and if not, we have a back up plan. The pilot welcomes us aboard and apologizes for the delay and said he needed rest. This the reason for our delay.

What sort of safety measures is this company taking pre take off if someone only noticed a flight leak this late in the game?

We were also told to collect hotel vouchers from the United attendants at the baggage hall however they denied all knowledge of this and sent us back upstairs.

I claimed online and was told I would not be reimbursed for any of the food costs incurred, or the taxi from airport to the airport hotel, or the difference between the United Airlines flight and the Singapore Air flight.

One month before our travel plans I received a message saying our departing aircraft was returning to Boston a full day later than we had booked for. Our 4 hour flight was now turning into an overnighter and 14 hour trip with 3 connecting airplanes to catch. I had hotel and car reservations that I was paying for in Boston for the day we had planned for. I lost almost $1000 on these plans alone. I contacted United and spoke with a very nice woman who helped me use their customer service tool to request reimbursement for my ""significantly changed flight"". I was reimbursed my trip at the assurance that I was still booked for the flight (I asked the woman about this several times throughout our conversation). She assured me that because United could not book me on another flight because there were none scheduled, I was entitled to my money back for my flight because of significant unavoidable changes to our trip. After checking one final time that I was still in fact booked for my flight, we hung up and I received my refund a few weeks later. Fast forward to the last day of our trip. I call United because I did not see a check in option for my flight and now my confirmation code won't work. Come to find out the United representative cancelled my reservation and I was without a flight and stuck in Utah. I gave this agent everything I had: case numbers from customer service, the name of the original agent I spoke with, dates, emails and she did not care to acknowledge any of it. She said ""I am sorry the agent gave you false information but you must buy your ticket for tomorrow on this flight at current market value"". Not only was my flight canceled on me, they charged me $900 dollars for a flight I originally purchased at $400. I informed the woman that on their website it says that United will reimburse for ""significant travel delays"". The original agent I spoke with quoted a delay of 6 hours as a significant delay which mine ended up being 14 hours by the time all was said and done.

There was a LONG line once we reached it, with only 2 agents available. It was painfully slow. They kept telling us to use the QR code and/ or the kiosk, but we needed to speak with someone so continued to wait. A woman cut in front of the entire line and the female agent helped her anyway. The line was frustrated and angry and a man went up and told the agent that the woman had cut in front of everyone and that it wasn't fair and she needed to wait in line like everyone else.

We tried to change our seats on the app because there were seats together they could have picked for us but we could not do this functionality for a rebooked flight on the app. So as soon as we got to Denver we asked an attendant to help us with our seats (he was just chatting away talking to his buddies) and said he could not help us we had to use a kiosk or wait 1 hour before boarding. Went to kiosk was going to be 85.00 a piece to Change seat. Then went 1.15 hour prior to boarding and the attendant said she’d be right back and it was 35 mins. She never came back. So we grabbed food. Went back before boarding began. No attendant at the desk. So we waited. It was the same agent again. We asked her to help us. Told her the above mentioned situation. She was rude and rolling her eyes. Called for a manager to come. Manager never came until boarding group 4. My husband stayed behind to speak with manager to at least get a refund on our seats we paid for. I boarded because I did not want to miss the overhead space (luggage was lost the last time we flew). A sweet lady who heard the story said she also was rebooked and got sat in a different row than her partner. So we switched places and another lady helped us out. We did get a refund for our seats.

Tried again to talk to the workers (which are on the phone or talking together) so every time you talk to someone you feel like you are not welcome … then they said to fill out a form on my phone but my phone froze and I couldn’t do anything. I asked and they said no phone working you don’t get in we’re sorry we can’t help.

"""don't mislead, and hold a flight""",1,2022-01-09,"Our United flight was scheduled to leave Omaha at 6:00 AM on the Saturday before Christmas. Apparently several flights were scheduled to leave Omaha then and there was a bottleneck at the TSA. We made it and boarded our flight at 5:45. At 6:00, it was announced that we were holding the plane for 30 people stuck in security. Reasonable , but it created a smaller window for making our connection in Denver. There was then a mechanical delay and we left Omaha with a targeted arrival in Denver of 15 minutes before our departure time to Portland. I spoke to a flight attendant once in the air and expressed my concern about missing a connection. She found that 17 people on our flight were booked on the same flight to Portland. She said we may have to run, but typically when there are than many people potentially missing a connection, that they will hold a flight for a few minutes. Not completely reassuring, but I appreciate the attempt. There was mention of a cart at the gate, but this did not develop. We landed and deplaned 14 minutes before our connection was supposed to depart. I sprinted from our arrival gate to the connection departure gate and arrive as the first of 17 at 7:43, seven minutes before scheduled departure time. Our plane was still connected to the jetway and luggage was still being loaded, but the door had been closed. The agent at the gate said she was instructed to close the door and it could not be reopened. I made it clear that 16 other people with similar concerns were soon to arrive at the gate. She said it was not her choice to close the door and there was nothing that could be done. We were instructed to go see customer service and the agent left the gate. We went to customer service and that was disaster. Short version is that we had an overwhelmed agent book us on to a flight 13 hours later; while she slowly does this and adds us to a standby list for a 10:50 AM flight, three others from my flight get on standby before my wife and I. My wife is a rewards member so she goes to the top of the list, but I stay at 5 for a full flight. Wonder what will happen? We are given $10 food vouchers for our inconvenience, which do not cover a sandwich. While waiting for the 10:50, I see a United advertisement stating they are #1 in on time departures for five years in a row. I now understand why. At 10:40 when the doors are supposed to close, the flight has ten open seats due to late connections. Instead of giving the seats to standby passengers and closing the door like they did with our earlier flight, they announce that they are holding the flight for 10 minutes. Then a second agent shows up who starts to argue about closing the door. She sends the first agent away. At 10:48, she panics and calls up the first stand by (my wife) who scrambles to get a boarding pass and boards. There is one seat left at 10:49. I push for it, she yells at me as she prints a pass, and then a booked passenger shows up, takes my place, and the family is split. On my way back to customer service, I spot a Skywest to Eugene (100 miles from Portland). I hustle to the gate and try to board. The agent is great and I board to Eugene knowing I have to figure out a way home from there. I emailed this and more to United and they gave us a $75 credit. Not enough.

"""food was the worst I have seen""",4,2021-10-19,"Not Verified |  I was excited to take my first transatlantic flight for over 18 months. A few weeks ago I traveled in United's Polaris Class from SFO to London (LHR) with two other members of my family. When booking the flights, the booking agents confirmed I would be in the new Polaris product with the Suites.  The outbound flight used United's old business class cabin which hadn't changed layout and seats (with the exception of some nice amenities). On the return flight, the plane had the new Polaris cabin which was great. United flies the 787-9 on this route. Many of these aircraft have not been updated to the new Polaris cabin. You can check if you are on the new product by looking at the seat map. If the cabin has four seats across you are in the new Polaris cabin. If there are six seats, you have the old business class product. Both ways the service was great from the flight attendants, though there was no personalized greeting once the flight was underway (an easy fix). The food was the worst I have seen across 20+ years of traveling in business class especially when spending almost $9000 in tickets. As an example, on the way back for the pre arrival meal, they served what was called ""hamburger wellington"" a dry hamburger with processed cheese and some kind of bread or pastry around it (see picture). Dinner was disappointing. I chose the beef which was over cooked and bore little similarity to what was described on the menu. Desert was a small tub of ice cream. The cabin staff who served seemed embarrassed and apologetic when I brought up the food quality suggesting cost cuts and COVID. There was no other food served during the flight between the 2 main meals so we went hungry. In summary, if you fly out of the US internationally and your equipment is a 797-9, you may not fly in the new cabin with the suites. It seems like the booking agents are unaware of the difference between the two business class products and you may be told you are flying in the new suites when you are not. At least I flew one way in the new product, but only because the equipment was changed at the last minute. When I booked the flight, it was a priority for me to travel both ways in the new product. If food is important to you as part of your flying experience, I would definitely advise looking at other carriers. If it's not a priority, I would advise bringing your own food or eating beforehand. In terms of alternatives to the UK from SFO take a look at British Airways and Virgin. You won't regret it.

At the time of booking the flight the tickets where between $ 100 and $ 150 for each, and we had enough credit for the tickets so nothing extra was charged to us. We even got an email with the confirmation number for the flight and everything was normal until then. However, on the 19th, we were not able to check in online due to a ""missing payment"", which we had no clue about it, we never get notified about a charge. After calling many time and spoken with a United agent, we were told to pay an extra $460 for each of us if we wanted to flight on our same flight, otherwise we had to wait until the next day. Although we did not want to pay that huge amount of money, we end up paying it because we needed to travel that day. United Airlines charged us the tickets as if we were buying it the 19th, at that huge price, even when we got it a week before and got an email confirmation with not charge. The story didn’t end there, after paying it and getting to Newark’s airport, we get notified at the gate that the flight was overbooked, so we had to wait for 2 volunteers in order for us to get on board, we were the last two persons to get on board.

We routinely find business class is staffed by the most surly, unfriendly and curt people. We can compare this to Turkish Airlines or Lufthansa Airlines which are all-but overboard friendly. Considering the dollar or points amount required to fly in business, you would think there would be some minimal staff quality control.

Other than flight being delayed while boarding the security put people in 3 huge lines just to make them stand in those lines for additional 20-30 min for no reason rather than just start gather people at the moment they are about to board the flight. Then while boarding yet again the same type of checking passports just to scan then anyways like every other airline and the scanner got locked out. So the whole situation ended up being the staff yelling and annoying the super disoriented people right before 9hr flight in very confined space. Food was absolutely horrible, I fly quite often with multiple airlines and I have never in my life been served such horrible food on the long flight and I flew with some airlines that don’t even exist anymore.

For this particular trip, our flights were booked through Swiss Air, but our first flight of the day was operated by United. United does not have Curbside Check-in, and we are moving to another country for 2 years, so we have the maximum allowed baggage (2 carry on and 2 checked under 32 kg -- based on Swiss Air's rules). The guy at the counter told us we had to have a negative test result before we could get a boarding pass but the location of the Xprescheck (where we scheduled to get our tests) is in the terminal, so you have to have a boarding pass to enter. He finally decided it was okay to use our vaccination cards. Our bag was two pounds over. He said it would be $400 per bag that was over.  We repacked to make sure each bag was under weight.  Your flight was delayed twice, so you're going to miss your connection in Chicago, even though you had a three hour layover. We'll rebook your flights for you.  The only flight he could find was the next day with 2 of us in Business Class and three of us in Economy for the first leg of the flight (basically any portion operated by United). But they don't offer to refund the difference between the price we paid for everyone to have Business Class nor do they offer any kind of assistance (like a hotel stay since it was their fault or even a free meal service)? Nothing. It's just our bad luck that we flew with United.  Went back to a hotel to wait for tomorrow's flight.

When we got there we were informed that our valid one day passes would not be honored ! This after taking a shuttle bus to a different terminal where the only open United Lounge was located. At this point we had to find another place to eat and relax. After checking luggage and going through security we waited about five hours before we realized that United was playing a game. We felt quite sure this flight would be cancelled at this point so we went to the customer service desk and cancelled our reservation and got a refund ( which takes approximately four days to credit your account!) We then had to go retrieve our luggage. That was the only bright spot in this mess ! It only took about fifteen minutes to get or suitcase back and the ladies at the luggage claim were very helpful. But the damage caused by this poor excuse for a business goes way beyond the flight tickets : $290 for hotel reservation cancelled, $300.00 for Pirates tickets not used, $100.00 for taxi service both ways and a small amount for tickets to the Aviary. Not to mention the cancelled plans ( made well in advance ) with friends ! We will never fly United again. I addition I will be closing my Chase/ United credit card.

"""I will never fly United again""",2,2021-08-12,"I fly relatively frequently for work, vacations, family visits, etc. I usually choose the cheapest flight that coincides with the dates of travel I need. However, I cannot excuse the pattern I've experienced with United Airlines. Again, since I typically choose the cheapest ticket price, I have flown United, Delta, American, Southwest, and Allegiant many, many times. I have experienced a trend with United that I have not experienced with any of the other carriers (including discount Allegiant). I would estimate that 35-40% of the United flights I have bought for the last 10 years have been delayed or canceled. Several times, this has resulted in an inconvenience. For example, my current experience is this: my return flight from Gillette, Wyoming to Denver was delayed by 2 hours. I received two texts that informed me that it had been delayed further. When u finally got to Denver, I had missed my connection flight to Nashville. After I de-planed, I spoke to the attendant at the flight desk. When I asked, he stated that the plane had been delayed due to maintenance and instructed me to go to the customer service desk to get my flight rescheduled and get hotel accommodations. When I did, I was informed by the customer service Manager that they couldn't do anything to help with my hotel. He stated that flight had been delayed by almost 2 hours due to the FAA air traffic control department. I asked him what that meant. He only vaguely explained and reiterated that United Airlines could not help with my hotel room. Therefore, I looked up all the hotels near the denver airport, and wouldn't you know it, they were from $150 - $550 per night. It was only 13 hours since my new flight left, so, I opted to sleep on the floor in the airport. I woke up multiple times, but made my way to the rescheduled flight and boarding time of 7:30 am. When I arrived at gate B60, I found that my flight had been, yet again, delayed over 4 hours due to ""maintenance issues"". I checked priceline to see if another flight could get me home. I found a flight at 10:00. I approached customer service to inquire about that flight. They informed me that flight had been delayed TOO. Therefore, my flight from Gillette to Denver was delayed and rescheduled for the next day. Then, that flight was delayed for over 4 hours. In addition, the two other flight to Nashville were also delayed. In addition to all this, I was beside a guy in the customer service line that had 3 flights delayed in one day. He had his Newark flight, Albany flight, and Denver flight ALL delayed on the same day that my flights were delayed.  I will never fly United again.

I explain my situation to them and the one gentleman says ""I will take your ID over the the agents at the gate, and I know they will print a ticket for you there, as I have done this before"".

Once I composed myself I decided that I would not rebook with United, and went to the American Airlines counter and purchased a ticket from them.

This time the change did not fit with out travel plans so I called for a refund. I was told over and over again they could not refund to my original credit card, but only for a travel voucher. Let me remind you they moved us from a $430.00 one way ticket (direct flight that we paid extra for on purpose) to a multi stop flight that took multiple days to get back to Denver. These tickets are about 250$ when I look today. They refused to refund the difference in fare change or refund the tickets. I asked for either of these options and was refused and told they could not do either. Absolutely disgusting and criminal and these people should be sued.

Boarding was done very orderly, First Class were called first then Economy were called by rows from back to front. Interesting concept of preventing Covid-19 transmission in this single aisle plane, letting First Class passengers get exposed to all Economy passengers passing them on their way to the back of the plane. Had this been a widebody this concept might work if Economy passengers entering from the second door, bypassing the First/Business Class passengers up front. It's obvious we are on an American carrier from the very tight pitch of seats, very different from Asian carriers we used in the past few weeks. The plane was clean even though it is kind of old (19 years - registration N37267). We used Clorox wipes to sanitize the tray table, armrest, seatbelts and screen when we got to our seat. We're back in the US so this is very important and it is something we have to do to keep ourselves safe!

Deplaning was done quick and very orderly, the FAs calling the rows to stand up to pick up our carry on and deplane while others behind were asked to stay seated, so there was no rushing or a line to deplane. It was an uneventful flight but the FA's cheerful and helpful disposition gives a good impression about United that they are improving their service.

Our flight from IAH arrived early so we have enough time to transfer. When we arrived at the boarding lounge the gate agents made us line up and check our travel documents before we were told we can take a seat. The process was slow and very ineffective; there are 5 gate agents but seems only 2 out of 5 agents know what to do since the other 3 older ladies always have to call and refer with the two guys for each and every passenger they are working with! Boarding was done from back to front and they call passengers by row so there is no crowding around the gate. Mask is to be worn at all times in the boarding area and during the flight except when eating and drinking. Prior to entering the air bridge was stopped by an air Marshall and was asked regular questions for the trip like cash we carry etc. since the region we are visiting is considered prone to financial issues. The kid was young and wasn't too experienced so initially he was kind of gruff; but after a while he warms up and even wishes us a safe trip. The metal was relatively new, clean and bright, and passenger load is around 30-40% so the flight attendants were able to move people around for social distancing so each of us can have a row of 3 seats for ourselves.

Boarding was done by rows from back to front, and gate agents announced it beforehand so everyone knows when they turn is coming and there is no rushing towards the gate. Very organized. We always carry some clorox wipes with us when we're flying that we use to clean the armrests, seatbelt, tray table, screen etc. since we didn't think the airline would provide the wipes. After we board, we were given sanitizing wipes, so we can use that instead of Clorox. Good job, United! We were given a package of pretzel and stroopwafel and a small bottle of water. Later there is a drink cart making rounds for people who wants to drink other than water. The seatback screen is loaded with enough entertainment to keep us busy during the 3.5 hours flight. We were provided 3.5"" earphones but we used our own wireless transmitter and bluetooth earphones to avoid all the cable tangle. The only minor issue is the built-in remote for the entertainment on the armrest that is not very responsive, but didn't prevent us from using the entertainment system. The FAs were quite cheerful and helpful, and they have good interactions with all passengers. A flight attendant was offering my seatmates if they wanted to move seats to another seat close by for social distancing since the flight was not full. Looks like they're doing a good job in trying to ensure social distancing - if the space is available. Flight deck updated us on the expected flying time before we leave, and also communicated on the expected arrival time and gate before we descend. The flight left only a few minutes behind plan and arrived in SFO 36 minutes early, giving us ample time for our 1:25 hours transfer between Terminal 3 and International Terminal. This is one of the good flights with United. The FAs are nice cheerful and helpful, and the communication from flight deck is informative.

When a couple passenger pointed out that it’s messed up to keep people close by during a global pandemic and that they were concerned about their health, the flight attendants’ response was that they couldn’t do it because of weight distribution, an issue that could have been avoided in advance by planning to spread people in the plane. Cherry in the sundae, before the flight takes off, the attendants starts reciting their corporate safety headlines, underlining how they’re taking extra steps to keep everyone safe, contrasting with the passengers herded in the back of the airplane.

First and most importantly, you failed to answer why my ticket, that I rightfully bought and reserved, with no insurance (so there was no chance of canceling on my end), was involuntary downgraded. Clearly United failed to provide a reasonable answer and this leads me to think it is a clear consumer/passenger abuse, JUST because the airlines can do so, given their small yet powerful concentration of market power. It was clearly incentivized due to making that extra margin from my seat having been sold to someone willing to pay more. What will remain with me is your reply to saying “we cannot answer you as to why we overbooked”. Policies as they are remain because of the failure of the DOJ to look into these matters as abuses. While I was forced to accept the unfair refund amount today, I will make sure that if there are class actions and lawsuits arising in the near future with matters relevant to refunds related to overbooking at United, I will be the first to join.

"""personnel had no idea where to direct me""",1,2020-12-30,"I'm a frequent business and pleasure flyer and flying United was the worst air travel experience I ever had. I bought a business-class flat bed ticket on United 363 from Newark to Honolulu leaving on 12/17/2020 at 9:50am. I required a business class level of service due to my injured spine with multiple herniated discs. Due to the snowstorm on the night of 12/16-12/17, I had difficulty finding a taxi and getting to the airport, and I arrived at the airport 50 minutes prior to my 9:40am departure. I had already checked in to my flight online and just needed to drop off 1 bag, which is technically still within United's 45-minute window submitting luggage for domestic flights. However, when I inquired about business class service, United personnel had no idea where to direct me. At first they sent me from the 2nd to the 3rd level of Newark Terminal C, however the United personnel there claimed they don't service Hawaii and sent me back down to Level 2, which was all Economy and big lines. I tried approaching multiple United personnel and all of them refused to help me and directed me towards Economy lines. Soon, they claimed I was too late for my flight - but I wouldn't be late if they did their job from the beginning and assisted me with priority service! At this point I was sent to wait in a massive line for customer assistance (again, no business class service to be found). I would have missed every other UA flight waiting in that line, but I also called United customer service by phone, where United phone agent (the only helpful agent in this entire experience) helped me rebook for a flight that departed one hour later, at 10:50am with a connection in SFO. However, I was made to pay a $539 flight upgrade fee that was sold to me as an ""upgrade"" from business to 1st class, which in reality turned out to be exactly the opposite, a downgrade: an old upright seat with minimal recline that is vastly inferior to my previously booked flat bed business seat, and much worse for my back. I found this deeply unfair. Even after rebooking, checking in to my new First Class flight was again a nightmare and I almost missed it, too, with no one willing to assist me even as I followed the phone agent's advice and told United personnel that I was flying 1st class. Probably 5 or 6 employees shooed me away and told me to get into a line for Economy electronic kiosks (half of which weren't working) and a long Economy passenger line for bag drop-off. The computer kiosk (when I finally got to it) again claimed I was too late to register baggage for my newly re-booked flight, but I miraculously found one competent UA agent who helped me overcome this. All in all, I had an absolute worst nightmare flying experience of my life. The physical pain in my back flared up from all of the dashing between floors, kiosks, and lines that I was made to endure with no one able or willing to help me. The service I received from United was absolutely abominable and especially so for business/1st class, and frankly it was horrible for any human being in any class to be subjected to such humiliation, physical pain, and monetary deprivation (which was unreasonable because I was actually downgraded, not upgraded). Online complaint with UA resulted in a generic ""you were late and we won't do anything"" answer (arriving 50 minutes should have absolutely been accommodated for a business class traveler who already checked in).

On my flight home, another packed flight, there was a guy across from us who was obviously drunk and kept throwing his mask on the ground refusing to wear it, none of the flight attendants noticed and I had to point it out to them, not to mention the fact that while he was unmasked he was coughing without covering his mouth, all they did was ask him to put his mask on a couple of times, but is soon as they would walk away he would take it off and look at us and smirk. When I asked the flight attendant why they booked the flight full and weren’t social distancing us,(I mentioned to him that other airlines didn’t pack the flight full), his response was, “Well southwest social distances on the plane for political reasons, but if you’re not comfortable you can get off the plane and book another flight”. So was he saying the pandemic is political and not real?

The issue came when I went to the rental car counter - I showed them my reservation and they did not have it. They claimed that I booked my reservation for the non-airport location. I had to bring up my email confirmation that proved otherwise. This caused a stir at the counter as they weren’t sure they would have a car for me.

Coupled with the aforementioned terrible flight, I wasn’t in the mood to be told there was no car availability when I had a reservation. I was able to get a car, but I had to pay extra due to the reservation “mixup” (if you can call it that). I filed a complaint with United Airlines and Dollar UA. United and Dollar UA accused me of changing my reservation to the non-airport car rental location, despite my email confirmation as proof that I did no such thing and chose the airport location to begin with. Both companies ignored several follow-ups and pleas to look at my case. In fact, at one point, they were pointing fingers at each other, trying to send me running in circles. I even emailed the CEO and COO of United and of course, heard crickets. The extreme amount of disrespect, disregard for human nature, and overall extremely poor customer service sickened me. I escalated matters to BBB. BBB did not resolve my case. BBB ignored my email confirmation that I booked for the airport pick-up location and sided with Dollar and United.

Apparently United is known to not get their planning right and it's an ongoing struggle and not customs fault at all. Poor form United for such a large company.

The flight (end of December) was delayed because they had to de-ice the plane which is okay. To not get the fumes of the de-icer in the plane, they turned off the air conditioning so things got stuffy and hot real quick. The plane did not return below 80 degrees for the rest of the flight.  I also happened to be in the row of seats that don't recline at all because of the emergency exits but the person in front of me did recline. So on my overnight flight I did not get any sleep because the conditions were so uncomfortable.

Checked in, boarded the plane, sat down, buckled up the whole nine. Aircraft pushed back from the gate at 12:38pm, taxied to get de-iced, because it's winter. After about 20mins and a colourful wash. Yay! I'm on my way- or so I thought. At 1:20pm I saw us heading back to the gate, bare in mind I've now been on this aircraft around 40 mins doing circles on the tarmac, no announcements made. When we finally parked at the gate, the captain came on saying the second engine would not start and they have called for maintenance and we should 'bare with them a minute' I've already bared 50 mins but who's counting. Around 1:50 or so we are told maintenance has arrived and has determined that they are unable to fix the issue and so we will have to disembark. At 2:20pm I got on the phone with United customer service, nice girl, after a 30 minute call she rebooked me on an Air Canada flight for 8:15pm to Houston, bare in mind my final destination is San Antonio. I was told there are no flights to San Antonio that they could get me on, now, I have a graduation at 9am tomorrow, so obviously I need to get there today. Out of frustration I said whatever, book the flight if that's the best you can do and I'll figure out the rest. I did this while in line waiting on the United reps to do rebooking, a line I stood in for over 2hrs. It's finally my turn, instead of being greeted with compassion and understanding, I was greeted with attitude, as if, I wrecked the engine and it was my fault the flight was cancelled or I was late for it. The agent seemed as if we were all bothering her, she wasn't pleasant at all. The only time I saw her smile was at a toddler, at least she likes kids. Though I was already booked on Air Canada, through my own doing, American Airlines had 2 flights out at 6:29pm, I asked if I could get on either flight as they both were going to Dallas then on to San Antonio, her reply was 'we don't have affiliations with American"". She said my only options were to do the whole flight tomorrow or stay over in Houston. I said absolutely not! I told her I'll keep what I have. Now, I'm super happy this engine did not fail while we were in the sky, but, there are ways to make a bad situation better and good customer service would have been one of those ways. No meal vouchers were given, nothing, no compensation in the slightest. In fact, the last apology I heard was from the captain while on the plane. I've been traveling since I was 7 years old, this was my very first time with United and I will never travel with them again! I know stuff happens, aircraft are machines and can have problems but people are not and someone who showed a bit of understanding and care for the passengers would have made all the difference today.

"""Never again with United Airlines""",1,2019-11-20,"Never again with United Airlines. My wife and I are returning from our “Dream Vacation” in Bora Bora (BOR); however, getting here and going home have been absolute nightmares. We started our trip on Nov 7th from BWI to SFO. Upon arriving at SFO we decided to upgrade the next (8 hour) leg of the trip to first class, and I can assume that is where the problems began. We arrived in Papeete PPT) without problem, but when we checked in for our flight from PPT to BOR the next morning, one hour before the flight, we are told we do not have tickets. The ticket agent sees that we have confirmed reservations, but says we are not ticketed. She says it appears United Airlines has “refunded” our tickets, and in order to continue on to BOR, we must buy new tickets now and work it out with UA later. With only minutes to spare before they start boarding (10 minutes before departure), we have no option but to purchase new tickets. Mind you this abbreviated version does not include my angry discussion with the Air Tahiti employees, sure they were the ones who had made the mistake, nor my wife’s plea to me to calm down. After arriving in BOR and checking into our resort I got online and sent a message to UA with all of the details I could include in 1,000 characters and pictures of the new ticket receipts, hoping to not only find some resolution, but also ensure we were good to go for our return. Days later my wife received an email confirming receipt of my correspondence, and they would reply in 7 to 14 Days. We attempted to place a wifi-call on 12 November, much to my surprise it went through. For more than two hours I tried to explain the issues to the United Airlines reservation specialist, and eventually supervisor. After the two hours had passed, I was told he could not do anything about the ticketing issues for our trip to BOR, but he assured me we were ticketed and would have no problem for our return flight, and we were emailed a new itinerary with e-ticket numbers. We are leaving BOR today, and decided to leave the comfort of our resort early to avoid a last minute rush if there was a problem with our tickets; we were booked on the last flight out for the night and didn’t have accommodations if we missed it. It came as no surprise this time to me or my wife when we stood a little longer than anyone else at the ticket desk while the agent pounded away at the keyboard, then the familiar question, “may I see your receipt or itinerary?” Seems the assurance and guarantee of the UA Reservation Supervisor that we would have no problem for our return was worthless, and I am glad we had the foresight to check in for our flight much earlier than necessary. The Chief ticket agent for Air Tahiti in BOR worked for well over an hour to try and find our tickets, with the following conclusions. United did something to take away our tickets and did not give us new ones, and the e-ticket numbers provided to us on our receipt returned “No information found.” Thus, we were forced once again to purchase tickets we have already once paid for. I asked the agents in BOR if this is a regular occurrence; the Chief agent said “with United, yes”, and her coworker shook his head in agreement.",True,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,"Batimore to Bora Bora via SFO, PPT",November 2019,4,3,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",3,3,,4,False

We both had a ticket and they didn’t sit us together I had to go up to the podium and they fixed it for me which was good but other airlines would’ve done it automatically without having to pay. My second complaint would be that on the connecting flight they didn’t have enough room for the carry-on bags which is really dumb since almost everybody paid for their carry-on bags they ended up letting people check them in but it’s still not fair since they charge people for the carry-on bag which other airlines don’t. Now my last complaint would be their willingness to help me get to and from my stroller with my daughter other airlines help me without me asking this airline every time I would have to wait for everybody to leave and that would receive help and would be the last one out. Their food policies were about the same you get free drinks one snack. Their attendance were a hit or miss some more sweet somewhere just straight up nasty I was confused on the flight where the bathroom was and one was very rude to me and just kept saying in the middle in the middle while I have my two-year-old in my hand.

We booked our flights though Air New Zealand (amazing airline) but unfortunately our flights from New Orleans to Houston and Houston to LA were operated by United.

On our electronic tickets it says that each person is allowed two bags on each flight. It also has the air New Zealand baggage policy that says 2 bags per person on each flight no matter who the carrier is. My partner and I each had two checked bags. When the United attendant asked how many bags to check, I said two each.
