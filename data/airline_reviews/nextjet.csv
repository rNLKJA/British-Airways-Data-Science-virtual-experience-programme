NextJet customer review,3,2013-04-11,"ARN-VBY-ARN sold/marketed under Gotlandsflyg but operated by Nextjet which claims to be Sweden's largest regional airline. The Visby flights were operated by a Saab 340 and load was about 30-40% in the offseason. Rather exorbitant prices if booked through the website (as much as $150-$200 OW) cheaper if booked through Gotlandsflyg and cheapest if booked at the airport on a stand-by price. On-board service is nonexistent no drinks everything for sale. Magazines of both Nextjet and Gotlandsflyg in the seatback pockets BOB in both listed as card-only but flight attendant only takes cash and offerings are completely different (though good quality and cheap.) Late on the outbound early on the inbound with poor service this ""airline"" left a lot to be desired.",False,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,,,1,,False
