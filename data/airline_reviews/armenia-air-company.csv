"""This is the worst airline""",1,2022-05-11,"This is the worst airline I had experience with. My flight was cancelled so that I wasn't informed about it. Employees of the company office located in Yerevan are so much unprofessional that it's better not to ask them even elementary question as their answer anyway will be - ""I don't know"". They don't speak English at all and their Russian is totally impossible to understand. When you call to their office, minimum 10-12 times you should call to be answered once, messenger works terribly, nobody gives you proper replies. This is the company with non-professional, irresponsible and incompetent staff with incompliant service and terrible attitude to their customers.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Moscow to Yerevan,April 2022,,,,,1,,False
