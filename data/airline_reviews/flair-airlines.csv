My brother is a stage 4 alcoholic who is in the process of dying due to liver and kidney issues but there was no threat that he would die on the plane as he still has several more months of suffering before that happens. His walking is impacted by severe arthritis in his spine that he is not being treated for and, among other complications, he has shortness of breath as a complication of alcoholism. He had a few drinks before boarding the plane because he is a severe alcoholic and without those drinks he would be at risk of dying on the plane. He flew in the exact same condition 2 weeks prior with Flair Air from BC to Calgary - and he required a wheelchair to board and disembark. He did not cause any problems during any interactions with any Flair Air staff when he was asked to leave the plane or at any time while waiting to get on the plane. He is a calm, docile man who would have happily sat in his seat, followed all rules and instructions and disembarked without any problems except the use of a wheelchair. Instead, he is denied his flight home, taken off the plane in a wheelchair and wheeled directly to 2 police officers who he once again had to explain his health to. They promptly wished him a good day. I feel that my brother was discriminated against because he is simply an end-stage alcoholic. The flight attendants said ""you smell like alcohol, have you been drinking?"" He explained his health conditions to them three times, but this did not matter as he had to leave the plane. He was at no time disruptive, out of line or inappropriate - he was even wearing his mask.

In speaking with a man from Flair Air's customer service, I found out the following. First, there are no notes explaining why he was kicked off the plane. Their notes report that he was a ""no-show"" when they actually had him boarded and sitting in his seat. Then the agent tells me that no-one who boards their planes are allowed to have any alcohol. I point out that airports have lounges in departure areas that serve travelers alcohol and airline flight attendants push carts down the aisles of planes selling passengers alcohol. No response from the agent. The agent reported my brother must have been drunk! I asked him if anyone bothered to test him to see if he was drunk as he has numerous health issues. Nope, just the assumption that the quiet man, who smells of alcohol is drunk.

As the only airline that flies direct to our specific destination, we could not reschedule our flight because this red-eye was consequentially the only time they were offering for the entire week once we were notified of the change. We lost a whole day of our trip because of this change. Their app does not work. It took 2-3 days to even list our flight and then would never display the details of the booking. Check-in was even worse. It showed that check-in was available, but then when I clicked ""check in"" it said that it wasn't available and send me on this repeating cycle of reminders and roadblocks. What normally takes 10 minutes with other airlines took an hour and a combination of their website check-in platform with chat support before we could actually get checked in.

It kept saying that D26 was our gate when it was actually D27 and the gates were far enough a part that no one would have known unless they thought to look at the airport board. The old man who sat next to us on the flight nearly missed it because of this false information continuously being given by Flair. He also shared our frustrations with check-in, having spent 3 hours over the phone with Flair before finally getting checked-in. After the trip I tried to contact flair to complain or receive compensation for this 12 hour delay, and they did not reply within 30 days.

Despite repeating myself on four different emails (it was even in the subject line) that my complaint was referring to the 12 hour delay, not one person addressed my complaint and instead continued to reiterate that the 1 hour additional delayed that happened on the day of travel doesn't qualify for compensation because it's less than 3 hours. The only thing that did not go wrong was the aircraft itself, although having to take a red-eye flight on an aircraft where the seats can't recline at all is awful. It is also hard to comment on the cain crew because other than the safety announcement and collecting garbage they didn't do anything. If you're flying for any amount of time over an hour, maybe two, never use this airline.

There is absolutely no benefit to flying with Flair. Even if you're the cheapest human on this Planet just trying to save a buck, do yourself a favour and pick any other airline. It's NOT worth the stress over the couple extra bucks they claim to save you. Starting with the fact that they charge you to bring every single thing on board with you. I'm not sure what the point in claiming to have cheaper fares is, only to charge people for every piece of baggage, sock, and item you bring on. You end up paying the save as any other flight, and at least they don't charge you for a carry on in most cases. So that already leaving a bad taste in my mouth, they charge you for your carry on + a checked bag should you choose to check one. When your on board there is no complimentary beverages. Not even water, you are expected to pay. There is no wifi on flight. They do have an app which you can watch movies & tv shows. However, if they can provide such then they should be able to provide Wifi. It's 2022. No drinks & no wifi on board makes for a fantastic flight! If that sounds like your idea to your start or end of a trip than Flair is the airline for you. I really wish I had known that prior to boarding.

I received an email the night before my flight this time, letting me know my flight was delayed.

Upon speaking with their live chat I'm told ""They moved my flight to August 10th"" No further explanation. What I don't understand is how they're unable to have more frequent flights to two of the countries most popular destinations, and they're boasting providing service to all of Canada.

Before you read this, you might be thinking, “sure, they have some bad reviews, but it’s probably because they’re a discount airline.

I’ve never experienced such disorganization, poor management, and complete disregard for customer service. After arriving at 6am for a flight at 8:30am (which had been delayed from its original departure time of 7:55am), we joined the check-in line to drop our bags. Despite checking in online beforehand, we had to wait in this line to drop our bags. We waiting for about 20 minutes before an agent told everyone in the line that we had to move to a different area of the airport to complete check-in. We then joined a massive line comprised of people from two flights. There were only two-three agents working to check everyone in. They began to prioritize the flight ahead of ours, which meant that it didn’t matter where you were in the line up, the people on the flight before mine got to go to the front of the line. It took agents five minutes per person to check people in. This is not an exaggeration. We stood in line for two hours simply to drop our bags. When we finally got to the front, the agent took our passports and then received a phone call. He handed the passports back to me and informed the group of us (around 20 people) that we wouldn’t be able to make it to our gate in time for our departure and that we needed to call Flair to sort this out. People were obviously angry and upset. I phoned Flair a couple hours later, after quickly rebooking my flight with a different airline. The customer service experience was abysmal. I explained the situation and asked for a refund. The agent consistently repeated their policy which states that because I “failed to show up for my flight” there was nothing they could do.

We wanted direct flight from Ottawa to Florida to minimize the travel fatigue. Major airlines are sold out on direct flights from Ottawa to Orlando as at the time we purchased our tickets. To avoid long transits in Montreal, Toronto, or other hubs, my spouse and I decided to consider flying with Flair Airline, since their flight is a direct 3 hours flight from Ottawa to Orlando, Sanford Airport. Interestingly, the difference in price between the cost of purchasing Flair Airline ticket for four, and the cost of purchasing tickets from other major airlines for four, as at the time we purchased our tickets (three months in advance), was negligible. Suffice to state that the cost of the ticket for Flair Airline was not a huge factor that influenced our decision. Rather, it was the fact that they fly straight to Florida. Sadly, on the day of our departure from Ottawa, at about 4.am while we were in the car heading to the airport to board our flight at 7.am, my spouse received an email from Flair Airline that our flight had been postponed to 9pm the same day. We were shocked and asked the Uber driver to return us back home. About 30 minutes on our way back home, we received yet another email from Flair. It was similar to the first one they sent except the time difference. It reads “ We wish to inform you that Flair’s flight F8320 from Ottawa (YOW) to Orlando (SFB) on Monday, March 14, 2022 will be delayed because of crew availability. Your updated departure time is now March 15, 2022 at 10:30 AM local time.” A few minutes later we received a series of other conflicting emails that keep moving the time and date. To cut the story short, Flair Airline did not airlift us as they only fly to Florida once a week. They ruined our family vacation. Our poor kids were devastated. They already told their friends they would meet in Florida. I was also devastated. We lost other incidental cost like hotel, tickets for Disneyland, etc. Finding alternative flights to Florida the same day during March Break comes with high cost financially.

All was well until the artist decided to change their show date by 3 months a few weeks after I booked my tickets.

There is the option of Travel Flex (which I'm pretty sure I paid for when I booked the tickets but didn’t have later, but that’s a whole other issue with booking thru 3rd party sites! Don’t do it!) which I also learned is a scam, as it only allows you to modify each flight one time, contrary to their offer of it being unlimited. Current state of flights: February 4th YYC-YVR, February 6th YVR-YYC. So I go to modify my flights, I select the first flight, input the new dates and move to the second flight. This is where I screwed up. On the Flair website, you can only modify one flight at a time. When I went to change the second flight, it didn’t go ahead with the first date changes, and I ended up with my departure flight being after my return flight and the system decided this meant I wanted to go from Vancouver to Calgary instead of Calgary to Vancouver. Current state of flights: February 6th YVR-YYC, May 19th YYC-YVR.

"""I must have valid identification""",2,2021-10-06,"I boarded Toronto with my ID, with no issue.

The Flair manager said that she couldn’t help me and that I must have valid identification in-hand to board the plane. This meant, having my passport somehow mailed to me while I wait in Edmonton. I share these details because even though I recognized that I missed renewing my licence, I was still frustrated that the airline couldn’t separate their policy from the human side of the situation. I should note that due to COVID the Ontario Government had provided grace period for renewing licences until 2022 to avoid people coming into their Service Ontario buildings. Regardless, I got a hotel room that night, renewed my licence online and printed off my temporary licence for my attempt to board the plane the next day. Prior to boarding, I double checked Transport Canada’s requirements, the official policy on Flair’s website and in both cases there was indication that my temporary licence accompanied with my photo ID was ok. In an effort to not disrupt the on-boardin process, I talked to Flair early to make sure that I would be able to get on. However, yet again, they said I would not be able to. This time, they said that my licence needed a white sticker to accompany the temporary licence and the photo ID (the latter two which I had).

"""I had a great experience""",9,2021-10-05,"I booked a flight with Flair Airlines after reading all the horrible reviews, because of the low price and because if my flight was cancelled like so many others say, it wouldn't be a big deal. After flying with Flair, I felt the need to write a positive review, because I think there are many people like me who have had a good experience, but most don't leave a review unless they are unhappy. The staff at the check-in counter were very friendly and went out of their way to help a man who had 5 bottles of wine that he wanted to bring on the plane. Of course, he couldn't bring it on the plane, but the employees came together and found a box for the man to pack the wine in and check and did not charge him a cent extra for it. The employee wrote, 'FRAGILE,' on every side and corner of the box, to make sure it was handled with care. Keep in mind, we were in New Brunswick and most east coast people are very nice, so that may have contributed to their helpfulness. The boarding staff were extremely friendly. Once on board, the plane was new and clean and my preselected seat was awesome! I sat in 1C where there was a ton of leg room and no one sitting beside me. The flight did not include any refreshments and I knew that ahead of time, so I brought my own snacks and a bottle of water I bought at the airport. The only real negative was that there are no power or USB outlets on the plane, which is not very convenient and I really don't understand, with it being a new plane. I did charge my phone while waiting to board, so I had more than enough power for the flight to Toronto, but I could see it being a problem for a long flight, or if you hadn't pre-charged. I can't tell you if the flight attendants were nice or not, as I had no interaction with them, even though I was sitting in the front row, right where they sit and hang out. None of them said a word to me, so I guess maybe I can conclude from that that they weren't super friendly. Overall, I had a great experience and the price was ridiculously inexpensive.

"""Flair does not have any standards for the staff they hire""",1,2021-09-29,"Hands down the most horrifying flight experience I have ever had in my life. I was going to Calgary from Toronto and arrived in Calgary without a hitch. Due to the pandemic there was a period of time when Service Ontario was not issuing renewed driver's licenses or health cards, so expired licenses are treated as valid as per the Government. I had therefore not thought to renew my IDs and did so a few days prior to the trip. So I had my hard copy expired license (still valid in Ontario) as well as the temporary ID form which clearly states that the ID is valid with the expired card with the form showing proof of renewal. However, this was not sufficient for the staff member from Flair. They allowed me to get on the flight to Calgary but would not let me on my return flight home. The only option they were giving me was to wait for my renewed license to arrive in Toronto, and then have it mailed to me in Calgary and rent out a hotel for a month, and get fired from my job. Thankfully I was able to speak to a reasonable manager from another airline who had capacity for common sense and sympathy, and was able to get on a flight home, but had to purchase new tickets for my fiance and I to get back home. I will be getting my money back from Flair if it is the last thing I do. If you have been unlucky enough to already have booked a flight with Flair, make sure they do not have the smallest of reasons to turn you away because they will do everything in their power to ruin your day.

The ground staff both at YOW and YYC were professional, friendly and helpful when dropping off our baggage and boarding us. The cabin crew on both legs were also both friendly and accommodating when we had any requests or questions during the flight. They were also clearly visible throughout the 4h flight handing out water and collecting garbage which is a definite plus, as I've flown on full service airlines where the crew disappears as soon as the food is served and collected. The cabin was a tad dirty with food crumbs on the floor and smudges on our window, but it's understandable when flying with a LCC, as I've seen worse. Yes, both legs of our flights were delayed for about 45 minutes but they were both due to missing passengers who probably checked-in online and didn't show up (which in my opinion, is not the airlines' fault). At least the airline had the courtesy to email us ahead of time to let us know of the delay. Yes, we had to pay extra to reserve our seats and also for checked-in luggage but the benefits of purchasing these extras online ahead of time was clearly mentioned on their website during the booking process and we also felt that the add-on prices were fair.

Also - while i was given vouchers in lieu of my unlimited Go Passes, the vouchers i was given did not have the same rights as the unlimited Go Passes did - they included no luggage and no priority boarding, which meant that it would cost me an extra $130 per leg of each flight to get the same rights I had before.

We were shuffled around to multiple gates at the Toronto Pearson Airport until 3 am the next morning for a plane that was never to come. We were unable to get a hotel room because we were constantly told the delay was just a few hours. The airline staff rarely gave us updates, and when they did it was that they had no updates.

Flair Air is a tiny privately owned airline with no partner airlines and so they will not help passengers to find flights on other airlines.

Then I phoned Flair to try and get a resolution to this because it simply was not my fault. Did they maybe double book me and used that as an excuse? Anyways, most airlines would reimburse the customer or put them on the next flight out. Not Flair. Flair requires you to pay a whole new fee.

Nice that you can select seats for free during check-in, which almost all ULCC's won't let.

On the way back from Calgary to Toronto, there was an incident where an ignorant man leaned his seat all the way back to the point where it was sitting in my lap. When I kindly asked if he would put it up just a little so that I could have a little leg room, he began a big commotion about how he paid for the flight and he is allowed to recline his chair however far back he pleases. He then proceeded to call over a flight attendant. The male flight attendant validates that there was nothing wrong with the situation even though he was clearly reclined right into my lap. The rude passenger then begins to yell about how this is reversed racism and that we only told him to raise his chair because we were being racist, to which the flight attendant still said nothing about. After having me as well as my mom plead to have his chair put up slightly, he then proceeded to do it angrily. Instead of the flight attendant saying anything about how ignorant the other passenger was being, he then returns and offers the passenger a better seat at the front of the plane. I found this extremely odd. Sure the ignorant passenger had moved and wasn't in my space no longer, but it felt odd that the flight attendant was validating this rude passenger. However this wasn't the only incident. The flight attendants also were terrible at responding to me and my family, they were extremely rude when they would walk by and ask us to take off our headphones, but we noticed that they would more kindly ask the passengers in front of us to take off theirs during takeoff and landing.

We said “sure” to go ahead and change our flight. The guy at the counter who was not at all friendly, asked for our passports and credit card. He started typing and we thought everything was good. Then he said it would be another $1200 each to change. We said we had not been told that earlier at 8am when we initially went to the counter. We told him we had waited for 4 hours for this flight and he had confirmed there were empty seats, so why were they now asking for an additional $2400 as well as the $25 each. He was so so rude, and there was no way he was going to let us change without paying. I asked for his name, he refused to give it to me. I asked for his supervisors name and again he refused to give it to me. I told him I wanted to speak to someone else and he said no. We said there was no way we were paying that amount. We told him we would just fly on our original flight and asked for our passports and credit card back. After we left the counter I called Flair customer service and spoke to someone there. He told me our flight had been changed and we owed $1200 and our original flight was gone! He said there was a note there that I had refused to pay!

I sat on hold for 2 hours with your company to have this changed, and was forced to say an extra day (again, because you canceled the flight). Then, days later, I was charged a ""change fee"" for having my flight changed. I sat on hold again for about 90 minutes to get this fee waved.

"""absolutely livid with this airline""",1,2019-07-18,"Calgary to Toronto. I am absolutely livid with this airline and I will never fly with them again. My fiancee and I need to travel to Quebec for a medical appointment. We decided to make a trip out of it and visit my best friend in Toronto for two weeks and drive to Quebec for the appointment. We booked our travel tickets through Flair Airlines. There was a change in my fiancee's university exam schedule and we found out we had to move our plane tickets. When I called them to do this, I was put on hold for 50 minutes before my call was answered. I am a teacher, so I have summers off and I phoned at a time where many people would be at work. When my call was finally answered, I couldn't understand anything the agent on the phone was saying. She constantly made mistakes while I was talking to her and she had zero customer service skills at all. Because we are travelling for a medical appointment, it is very important that we get there for a specific date/time. They had no flights that could accommodate our schedule and we are being forced to go 2 days later. When I expressed my concern with their service and with this entire process, she said nothing and changed the subject. She then quoted me that the charge would be $133 per person. I chose to only change one ticket, as it is my best friend and I could simply spend the extra week with her while my fiancee stays home to write his exam. She also told me she could ""not guarentee"" how much it would actually cost to change the ticket, as she could only give me a quote and not the real price. Huh?! How is it that I am calling you, with my credit card in hand, saying I will make this change now, and you cannot tell me what it is going to cost until you submit the irreversible changes?? That is absolutely ridiculous. When she hit the ""change"" button, the price magically jumped to $188. She told me that the charges were because of ""tax"". I live in Alberta and the tax rate is 5%, meaning tax should be no more than $10 on a $200 purchase. This purchase wasn't even for $200, so there is no way that was adding up. When I questioned her on it, she noticed that I had been ""mistakenly"" charged for the $15 change fee that isn't supposed to apply to ticket change requests. She then put me on hold for 15 minutes while she called to get support to change that. She could not explain where the rest of the charges came from and when I tried to question her, she answered every single question with ""would you like me to proceed with these changes,"" regardless of how many times I asked her to explain it to me. Eventually, as we didn't have a choice, I paid it out of frustration. In total, the call with her trying to get a simple time change applied took an extra 27 minutes, meaning it took almost an hour and 20 minutes to do something that should have taken no more than 5 minutes. After reading everyone else's reviews, I feel lucky this was the only issue I've had so far. Now, we are terrified that my fiancee's flight may get cancelled at the last minute (which we have seen has happened to other people) and the medical appointment is for him.

"""service was extremely poor""",1,2019-07-16,"Vancouver to Calgary. Originally I chose to fly with them because the cost of the flight was very low, but in the end, it has cost me more money and stress than any flight I’ve ever taken. My incoming flight was cancelled and rescheduled to a new flight a day and a half later then what I booked. The airline did not notify me of this change. I found out when I went to check in online for my flight 24hours before departure and saw that the flight was leaving a day and a half later. Cutting my trip short, costing me money in accommodations and altogether ruining my plans for those two days. I called the airline to discuss this and they said there was nothing they could do. They offered to cancel and refund my flight all together but that is beside the point because I still have the intentions of taking this trip! The only other option they said was to change my return flight to 2.5 days later then I planned on returning, which is also fairly useless because I planned my trip around specific dates for a reason. According to Flair, there were “no other available flights” whatsoever. After being thoroughly disappointed by the conversation with the Flair agent, I hung up and waited until I could do the online check in for my flight. Upon filling in the online check in, I see that they are trying to charge me for a carry on bag. Apparently this was in the fine print when I booked the ticket - which I did not see. Also, on every flight I have ever taken, the carry on bags have been free. I had to pay $35 for a carry on bag, which now tacks on an additional $70 to my flight fee for the trip, along with the wasted money for arriving a day and a half late. I called a second time to talk to someone about the situation. I discussed my previous phone call about my flight getting cancelled and rebooked without notification and then the fact that I have to pay for my carry on bag as well. The agent explained the rationale behind charging for a carry on and fuel costs and cabin space. I told him I understood however I was dissatisfied because of all these out of pockets expenses I now have from arriving a day and a half later and having to pay for a carry on. He transferred the call to a “financial assistant“ of some kind - whom I waited for for nearly 20 minutes. After explaining my situation to her she simply says “no ma’am, there’s nothing I can do”. Refuses to offer any sort of compensation, compromise or any assistance whatsoever. After being on the phone another hour with zero help at all, I hung up the phone. For return trip home, I checked in online for my flight 24 hours prior and on the form I fill in 1 carry on bag for the $35 fee. I complete the check in and arrive the next day at the check in counter and the woman informs me I have not paid for a carry on bag. I discuss that I did indeed put 1 carry on bag for $35, just like I did on the way here. She looks and me and just says no. I tell her again, the process I took when booking it and am not sure why it did not work. She now says I must pay $50 for a carry on bag! At this point I am absolutely fed up with the service but I remain polite and calm and tell her that this airline has been absolutely horrible to deal with and hand her my credit card.

But to even get the vouchers proved a difficult task, as there was a huge line and only one person dealing with the mess. There was another huge line to process refunds, but that too was a mess. Another issue: getting refunds from them is beyond difficult. I initially booked on a wrong credit card, so applied for a refund within their 24-hour window. I had to call and email to confirm that they even received my application. Then, when a refund didn't materialize within the 7-10 day window they promised, I had to call again. Now the wait became 3-4 weeks. When a refund still had not materialized after that, I went ahead and disputed the charge on my credit card (by the way, that process took 2 business days). I suspect there is something fraudulent going on with the airline, as it makes no sense why it should take 3-4 weeks for a refund to occur, especially after it had already been processed. As for the flight itself, it was average. The plane was dirty and old, but the service was quite good. The attendants were very apologetic about the delays, and gave us the basic teas and juices for free. Otherwise, even water would have cost money. I would avoid this airline in the future. I actually suspect they won't survive the new rules being implemented in July, with how much compensation they would have to give out under the new legislation.",True,Boeing 737-800,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Toronto,June 2019,1,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,1,False

The inconvenience was not worth the money we saved! We booked our flights with Flair from Edmonton to Abbotsford as well as return flights back in Jan of 2019. Our flight to Abbotsford was scheduled for 10:25 on 5 Apr with our return flight scheduled for 13:25 on 8 Apr. On 29 Mar we received an email stating our return flight was changed from 13:25 to 16:25. This was a large inconvenience but we were committed at this point. Fast forward to 5 Apr, the morning of our scheduled departure. We wake up early to get ready for our flight and I see an email stating our flight will be delayed by an hour or so. We decided to get to the airport early regardless as it’s an hour drive. Everything seems fine according to the board for departures and at the gate. 30 mins before our scheduled departure they announce we will be boarding immediately. Nothing happens. When we should be taking off they announce at the gate there was “unscheduled maintenance” and we would be delayed another 30 mins. This again changes to 1.5 hrs. Then we are told we will be getting a different plane. Then another delay, and another. We eventually depart at approx 18:15, almost a full 8 hours later on the original plane we were supposed to fly on. Needless to say this was a massive inconvenience and ruined our trip. Flair gave us a $10 food voucher for the inconvenience! How kind! That doesn’t buy you a pretzel at the airport, and it also couldn’t be used for alcohol. So we saved $150 on the flights but spent over $300 on food and drinks as we were in the airport for so long. On 8 Apr we are ready to board and again find out as we are supposed to be boarding there is “unscheduled maintenance”. Fortunately this ended up being only about an hour delay.

"""Most bizarre experience""",1,2019-02-19,"Most bizarre experience ever: My father and I were booked on F8766 on 19 February Phoenix/Mesa Edmonton. Not only was the flight two hours late to depart (10 pm) but there was a sudden, unscheduled stop in Palm Springs which none of the passengers knew about until it suddenly landed. It was unbelievable. People were in shock. When we asked why the stop, the airline crew said they had to pick up passengers who had been stuck there since 7.30 am. People blurted out 'is this a bus?'. This incident with the protracted flying time and uncertainty, threw my father (who was turning 90 two days later) into a state of anxiety which only increased as the plane sat on the tarmac for hours, further delayed by an elderly passenger who soon after boarding, had a sudden medical condition (probably from having had to wait at the Palm Springs airport for most of the day due to another Flair mess up). We finally arrived in Edmonton to minus 20 degree temperatures at 5 am. My father was extremely anxious the whole time, and has remained so ruining his 90th birthday party, which I flew to Canada for from my home in Sri Lanka. I am now delaying my stay in Edmonton to care for him as such, when I requested the airline today to cover my flight change, they gave the lamest, poorest excuse I have ever heard, that the diversion (which was clearly deliberate and sneaky on their part as none of us were advised before or during departure about the Palm Springs diversion) was 'beyond their control' - I wouldn't even call what they said an apology - the minimum expected - nor of course any cost consideration (for me it was the principle to request). I work for the United Nations and as such have been living and travelling internationally, including in many weird places on small airlines, for more than 30 years.

The plane left on time and the seats were very comfortable with almost a little more legroom than WJ or AC (We were in row 4). Landed in Palm Springs and our bags came out in no time. The return trip was 1 hour delayed due to weather in Edmonton (the inbound flight). The airport staff kept us updated and boarded us as soon as they were able. The inflight crew was great again and so were the seats. Again we had an entire row to ourselves and so it was a great flight north. Once we arrived we only waited maybe 2-3 min before our bags came down the belt in customs. I have to say that since you have to pay for overhead bin space and not many people did as you could easily just put it under your seat, the boarding and deplaning was way faster than WJ or AC. All in all a great trip especially for the price. When you go on a super budget discount airline you can't expect much and I was impressed overall by the experience. I will fly Flair again.

On the way to Las Vegas we had a scheduled layover in Edmonton that ended longer than expected. Flair Airlines had initially informed us that it was a crew rest issue, then it was that they were waiting for a co-pilot and the stories kept changing. Initially our flight was to be a direct flight from Winnipeg to Las Vegas and return but 11 days before departure they notified us that we would be going to Edmonton due to a change in the winter schedule (only to find out that they had not sold as many seats as expected). The layover of 3 hrs ended up being 5 hrs plus. Arrival at the Macarran International Airport was just as chaotic.

This was again stated very clearly at the gate that we would have our connection flight to Winnipeg waiting for us. Again every excuse about the delay. From what was conveyed to some travellers was that there were about 45 passengers connecting. Keep this in mind that there were 45 passengers deplaning, having to do a 5 minute walk to the customs hall, clear customs, wait at the wrong carousel that the agents had announced though it was minor, to exit customs and lug our baggage to the Flair counter who appeared to be unaware of our situation (in retrospect their doe eyed response most likely due to the plane preparing to leave without us), to then just clear screening to have final call be announced. That was just wrong, we had to run to the gate, others contemplated running in their socks from screening to make up time. No one took their time, we didn't even have time to take a washroom break unless you were waiting for your luggage in the customs hall. There were no agent to answer questions at the customs reception, passengers were given the impression that their luggage would be transferred to the connecting flight. I had to inform a select group sitting next to us in Las Vegas that we would have to hump our luggage to the check in counter.

They do absolutely nothing to compensate their clients for serious inconveniences such as this. I didn’t even get the drink they promised me. They don’t have backup planes, so if the plane is screwed, you’re screwed. They seem to get away with charging people ridiculous amounts of money for a CARRY-ON.

At the Flair Air departure desk, I learned that my flight departure would be delayed for 5 hours to 4:45pm. The reason provided: the pilots are sleeping and had not had enough sleep due to Prior day flight delays. At 2pm, I learned from the Flair Air departure desk that my flight would be further delayed an additional 3.5 hours (ie a total of 8.5 hours from the original planned departure) to 8:15pm. Apparently the pilots must have been very tired. Barring any further delay and assuming the flight departs at the currently revised 8:15pm departure, I will have been at the airport for 10.5 hours (2 hr early arrival + 8.5 hr delay) and this is for 1.4 hour flight. I saved $50 by selecting Flair Air over its main competitors (west jet and air canada). If you value your time, do not book Flair Air. This is my first booking with Flair Air and it is also last. I am sure the larger competing air lines have a greater complement of flight personnel to draw upon thus avoiding such delays. As a side note, the Flair Air departure desk staff indicated that they had been on duty for 18 hours (some sleeping over at the Calgary airport) and they were tired and very disappointed and unhappy about the flight delay. Anyway, it seems that Flair Air is run on a shoestring budget and that as a consequence they cope very poorly any unforeseen contingencies.

First time- they pretended to delay our 7am flight from Toronto to Winnipeg. They kept saying ""we'll update you in 15 minutes"" and ""corporate hasn't told us anything"". Eventually people caught on that they did not have a backup plan for the plane (which had some sort of mechanical error) and started getting refunds. Horribly- they did not cancel the flight, just kept delaying it. This way they wouldn't have to reimburse for hotels or do the work to book us with another airline. They gave us $10 meal vouchers for the wait. They didn't even work, it looked like they had just printed it themselves and no one officially recognized it. Then when I got my refund and rescheduled, they took 6 hours to give me back my bag. Which was sitting right there the whole time. Me and the other customers were beyond frustrated, we thought we had lost our luggage, and there was no Flair official at Pearson to help us- even though the airport baggage officials called them on the Public Announcer! I had changed to a WestJet flight instead, but ended up missing a couple of those too because I hadn't gotten my luggage back yet. Thankfully Westjet was great and I got to Calgary at 1am that night (after leaving home at 4am). Unfortunately I had already booked a round trip, so I didn't change my return flight home, hoping it would be fine. But I'm sitting here right now after my flight was delayed 1 hour, then we got in and it was delayed further, then we finally got up in the air and they turned back 20 minutes later because of an engine light.

"""nickel and dimes ruined my experience""",2,2018-12-29,"Sadly there is no such thing as ""low-fare"" airlines. It was the matter of nickel and dimes that ruined my experience with Flair Air. The flights were booked by my older brother for our visit. I had no additional funds for add-ons. He informed me that I was allowed two bags free of charge. (This was incorrect but the itinerary shows one included bag twice, causing the confusion.) I boarded the flight in Calgary without issue. We waited longer than usual before take off. If you had headphones in or your nose in a book, you were told to pay attention because a continuously delayed safety demonstration was always about to start. Once in the air I was disappointed to be served only about half a cup of water free of charge and nothing else. These were all minor inconveniences, though. The decision not to fly with Flair again was made on the return home. I approached an agent for my gate number immediately upon arrival at the airport. Instead of answering my question, he told me I was only allowed one bag. Despite my explanation of the confusing itinerary and not having been charged on the previous flight I walked away defeated and began to condense my two bags, including giving away the small Christmas gifts from my brother since I couldnt afford to pay. When I returned to the desk a different agent further explained that that bag itself was still too large and would require a fee regardless. I had given my gift away for nothing. Both agents told me the cheapest solution was to pay online. I wanted to do so at the gate though and it took some pressure for the agent to finally disclose my gate number. When I arrived at the gate I found out the agents were wrong, as I had already checked in online which includes an option for purchase. I was faced with calling customer service or surrendering my bag (or now paying $80 for the bag). Luckily, the agent I spoke to on the phone was wonderfully helpful and pleasant. This included informing me my flight was delayed as Flair doesn't send notifications. After all of that, would I spend an extra hundred dollars or so to fly with an airline with good customer service, included carry-ons, complimentary in-flight snacks and notifications of delayed flights?

"""Worst airline experience ever""",3,2018-10-30,"Not Verified |  Kelowna to Edmonton. My original flight was to leave at 2:25 on Thursday Oct 25, 2018 and you're required to be at the airport 2 hours early to check-in- for a domestic flight, which I find is way too early. The desk closes an hour before take-off which I also find unreasonable. Anyway, I'm there early with enough time for any unforeseen traffic delays as I have to drive 1-1/2 hrs to get to Kelowna airport. Flight gets delayed til 5:30pm due to a cracked windshield on the plane. Great. Things happen but I have an event that evening that I do not want to miss. So here I'm at airport for 7 hrs. I just make it to my event on time. Now to come home on the Sunday Oct 28; flight was to leave at 5:30pm so I'm at airport 2 hours early to be informed that the plane is delayed til 10:30pm because it hit a bird. Like really?! Here goes another 7 hr delay. No food vouchers available. They offered refunds but what good does that do when you go to book another airline for that day for $325 return and I only paid say $130 for that leg back. Then come the complaints. Another couple was there for 24hrs waiting to get a flight back as their flight was delayed then cancelled then delayed then delayed again. This airline only has 7 older planes so its difficult to get a back-up plane with such a minimal fleet. Another Flair plane was there on the tarmac but it required maintenance too. SO if you have nothing but time, and no deadlines, then please chose Flair Airlines. I finally arrived home at midnight, thanks to my awesome friend who waited to come get me or else I wouldn't have had a way home. Worst airline experience ever.

Booking: Found my way through booking as they appear to be cheaper at the onset, which is true if you do not travel with anything basically but you still have to figure out what your basics are up front. Paid my way through it all checked bag, carry on, seat selection all good and easy and is when I realized I should have just booked with a major airline. Day before flight: Checked in online easy enough but you have to watch what you are doing as it appears you can double pay for your checked, carry on etc. Day of flight: get to airport and check in and check my bag as normal. I go get a coffee and sit and wait to board. I was paged to the counter and was then asked if I had changed my seat, which I paid for in row 3 window so I could exit the plane quickly upon landing. I said no but confusingly accepted my new boarding pass and sat back down in the waiting area. When I realized I was in row 14 middle seat I went back up to say I had not changed my seat and why would I go from the front way back there? They put me in the exit row aisle, good enough I guess, still no reason? I was pretty much okay with everything until I filled out a complaint form online. The response I got was this ""I can see your frustration on the seat selection change, Sometimes the flight director needs to make changes to either a broken seat or for a mother and a child. This dose not happen often."" Load of crap, I have never been bumped from a paid seat, and they make it a priority to ensure you are paying for every last droplet of service you ask for upfront before you get to the airport only to just take it away?

When you research a flight, you are given a list of 3 or 4 ""options"". The way it is presented makes them appear to be set prices. There is nothing on the page to indicate they are variable and will go up. You can find that information buried in the huge FAQ section, but their is nothing on the actual page with prices. Nor do they say how many tickets are available at that price. Essentially they are creating a fear based reaction response. As well, when you book your ticket, you are given all the options for baggage purchase right then. Once again, it does not inform you on the actual purchase page that you have the option to purchase later (you have to dig that up from the FAQ). So they worry you into buying a ticket quickly, throw all the purchase choices at your without properly informing you of your rights, and if you are panicked into buying too much luggage, will charge you to refund them! I learned this all the hard way. I was online and purchasing my ticket, and was quoted $992 for my flight of 4 tickets. I got to the luggage choice, couldn't find the information on the fly that I could choose to book luggage later, but clearly understood that I'd have to pay to cancel luggage, so I called the centre to get the answer. By the time I got back to the website the 20 minutes window timed out. The next chance I had to start all over to purchase, the price jumped up $350! This is despite the fact that visually the flight looked equally half empty both times (you see the map when being offered the seat selection).

There was a lady blocked me while I was going in line and asked me if I have checked in online and I must pay a fee for my small bag! I told her I travel with that small luggage all the time no problem, and her response was, ‘those are different airlines’. You pay extra $45 for that luggage which is such a money grab! Also, flight was delayed for over 2 hrs due to crew rest if they can’t handle how much guest flyers they book in, then they should not operate at all. Which they only have 1-2 flights in Calgary.

"""never made it on board""",1,2018-07-05,"I booked in March to fly to Vancouver fron Kelowna on June 29. The morning I was to depart, I tried to check in online, but there was no Flair flight to Vancouver that day. I went to the airport, because I could not get through to the customer service line. I was told at the Kelowna ticket counter that my flight had been changed to June 27 (two days prior), and there was no flight to Vancouver that day. I received no notice of this change. After escalated tempers because they offered me unsatisfactory alternatives, they booked me on an Air Canada which was flying direct to Vancouver. The other alternatives were flying to Edmonton and then back to Vancouver, or flying to Abbotsford and taking a taxi to Vancouver. I was going to a celebration of life and neither of these options was going to work, as the arrival times would get me to Vancouver AFTER the celebration. I managed to get to Vancouver, but the flight they booked me to return was three days AFTER I needed to be back. After numerous hours waiting to get through to the customer service line, and numerous emails to the ""consolidation department"", nothing was done and I was stranded in Vancouver. As it was the Canada Day long weekend, I was stressed for the whole duration, wondering how I was going to get home and back to work on Tuesday. Finally, after hearing NOTHING from the consolidation department, I booked a bus ticket home.  I have never had such terrible service in my life.  They ignore, refuse to offer any assistance for the screw-up they caused, recite the same unhelpful rhetoric no matter what you say to them, and are completely oblivious to decent service. No ""discount fare"" is worth the hell this airline caused me. What was supposed to be a family weekend to say goodbye to a beloved family member turned into a total farce, trying to get answers from a company that clearly doesn't care about it's customer base. And as for the rating out of 10, mine is a ZERO, except the indicator won't let me select that. Value for the money is also ZERO, as I am now out of pocket the return flight AND the bus ticket i had to purchase. Ground service? ZERO. Why was I not notified of the change in my flight?

"""Customer service did not exist""",1,2018-02-11,"Kelowna to Edmonton. On January 11th I had the unfortunate experience of flying from Kelowna to Edmonton with flair airlines. While the staff were kind, the communication was extremely poor. While waiting in the Kelowna airport we were advised that there was a delay with our flight and that we would perhaps be rerouted and might be home in Edmonton around 1930hrs. They announced they would be updating the awaiting passengers but failed to do so. Any announcements that were made were very quiet (as opposed to all other airlines who announced very loudly and clear), and the information was very unsure and did not provide very important information to the passengers. In order to obtain any important information, passengers were forced to approach the desk to ask the staff. I found staff to be unprofessional in their communication with passengers. Some passengers boarded our plane in Kelowna, which got rerouted to Edmonton via Abbotsford, and didn't even know it was going to be making the additional stop. Passengers behind me thought they boarded the incorrect plane because it was not explained clearly what was happening. In addition to that, seating turned into a ""free for all"" as it was open seating. Something that was again not announced to passengers and so an unnecessary amount of confusion ensued. Again proper communication could have alleviated a lot of these frustrations. Ultimately the goal is to get to your destination on time, and not to get any ""free flight"" or ""travel voucher"", but I do have to say that I was very surprised and unimpressed that nothing was offered to passengers to apologize for the supreme confusion and significant delay in flight (we got into Edmonton almost 7 hours later than we were supposed to). When we landed in Abbotsford, flight crews switched out and all seemed confused as to what was happening. Passengers boarded in Abbotsford and were told to look for their assigned seats, while passengers from Kelowna were still sitting in the ""open seating"" seats from the previous flight. The flight attendants changed their minds multiple times as to if it was going to remain open seating or Kelowna passengers were to move to their original boarding pass seats. Mass confusion ensued and oncoming passengers began getting angry with Kelowna passengers that were told to remain in their open seating seats. It was terrible. Flight attendants stood by watching passengers getting yelled at by other passengers and failing to explain clearly to people what was going on. I have been flying regularly since I was 5 years old (and am now 33) and this is hands down the absolute worst flying experience of my life.
