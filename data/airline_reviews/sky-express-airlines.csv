"""kept telling me they reimbursed me""",1,2022-11-16,"We arrived late to Athens because of a delay in Toronto, and rushed to get to the Sky Express gate for our next flight to Santorini. We arrived with 30 mins to spare and after consulting with her colleague, the attendant determined it was too late for us to board and we would need to buy new tickets for the next available flight. Later we were told via email that we needed to be there 20 mins early but we were 30 mins early! Either way, we purchased new tickets and were given contact info for Sky Express to receive a refund of our taxes due to the missed flight. After our trip ended, I contacted the airline and provided all of our info and was told I would be reimbursed within 30 days. Well 30 days passed, then 60, then 90, and I was following up regularly via email but NO responses from anyone. Finally I called the airline and was told they reimbursed me in August to a card ending in 6237 but my card ends in 7237 so there is a mistake and I did not receive my reimbursement. They kept telling me they processed it and there was nothing further they could do. I provided proof of my purchase using MY credit card, and screenshots of my credit card statement, and they still kept telling me they reimbursed me (but to a card that I don't own). Finally they sent me ""proof"" of reimbursement, which is totally laughable, because the ""proof"" showed that they reimbursed a MASTERCARD in my husband's name ending in 6237 (which is not his card, and he only has a Visa), meanwhile it was MY VISA that was used to purchase the tickets - so how can you reimburse someone else who did not make the original purchase?

"""no one had even bothered to contact me""",1,2022-07-31,"Though I had been allowed 23 kgs in my suitcase to arrive into Greece via Emirates, Sky Express only allowed 17 kgs to fly from Crete to Athens.

Totally not worth the back and forth walk around the airport or the set of stairs we had to climb with our carry on bags. Supposedly the VIP pass allows people to board ahead of the line, but no one called out any different categories and everyone was allowed to rush out of the door at the same time and onto a bus that would drive us to the plane, where we would have to climb a set of stairs to board. Upon arriving in Athens, we discovered one of our suitcases didn't make it. Actually, we didn't even know if it made it or not. Maybe it was still in Crete, or maybe it made it to Athens and was forgotten outside behind the luggage carousel. No one could tell us anything, nor did they even try. The Sky Express counter rep was less than helpful and made it clear to us that she did not want to deal with the issue of lost luggage, despite that being her actual job behind that counter. Instead, she sent me all the way back to the carousel to wait for my suitcase even though I had told her the conveyor belt had stopped running, all the other passengers were gone and the sign above the carousel indicated that there were no more bags. She refused to fill out a lost claim for me and kept insisting that there were delays and that the luggage might ""show up at some point"" and sent me back to wait at the empty carousel four times. After three hours with no results and her refusing to help me, the rep finally filed a claim report for me and gave me a number to call. She promised someone would call me in a couple of days with news about my luggage, but I never received a call, email, text message or anything. In fact, the number on the report she told me to call turned out to be an inactive number. So, I had nothing but an empty promise and a fake phone number at my disposal to try to find my luggage. Nine days later, when I was leaving Greece, I arrived at Athens airport early to see if anyone had bothered to look for my suitcase. There were at least ten other people crowding around the same claim counter who also lost their luggage with Sky Express, and no one was getting anywhere with the counter rep. After a while, we were told to walk around the airport and look for our bags in the corners of the building. When that didn't yield results, we were finally escorted to the basement of the airport where hundreds of pieces of unclaimed luggage lay unclaimed and many untagged. It was there where I finally found my suitcase.
