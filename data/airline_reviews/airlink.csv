"""flying can be an enjoyable experience""",10,2022-11-20,"Airlink is a high quality airline. I am content with their service and cannot find any fault in them. Used them on a round trip from Namibia to South Africa. The first scene which stood out to me was viewing the plane in real life with the sunbird logo. The food packaging is divine. They had a real life high quality glossy sunbird image on them. First flight I received the “Scarlet-chested Sunbird”. Second time was the “Double-Collared Sunbird.” The birds are admirable in their colourful feathers and exotic designs. For the menu they began by serving a drink, followed by a sub-lunch with the option of coffee or tea. A few minutes later, air hostesses came around offering a drink one last time before the plane’s descent. I am glad they added coffee or tea to the sub-lunch as the lunch alone is not very filling. My first sub-lunch consisted of: rolled smoked turkey slices, creamy honey mustard pasta shells, butternut and feta salad. For dessert, which was my favourite delicacy of the sub-lunch, was the custard and jelly topped with white and brown chocolate shavings. Not sure whether that’s what it actually is, however that is how I would describe it. Final part of dessert is a gourmet fudge which was over sweetened in my opinion. I have a sweet tooth, however this treat was too sweet. My second sub-lunch, I forgot to capture the menu of the second sub-lunch, however I did snap a picture of the food so here’s me writing the meal in my own words: rice, baloney style beef and corn salad. Dessert was the same as the first meal. Food tasted delicious. I appreciate the sub-lunch not being too heavy. Plus the flight is short-lived, therefore a heavy meal is not necessary. To add, they have Schweppes lemonade on board. The refresher towel which came along the sub-lunch was useful in sanitising my hands and dining tray. The Embraer-190 is small but durable.  Return trip I booked a window seat with grand views. It was fascinating viewing the outline of South Africa colliding with the massive blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean, with all the shaping exactly how it’s portrayed in the maps. When flying over Windhoek I gazed through my window and was blown away by the 42 000 feet view of Windhoek’s terrains. Below me was a collection of mountains and shrubs. Airlink is gentle with luggage and cabin crew is polite and hospitable. A free copy of Airlink’s in-flight magazine in the front pocket. There is no in flight entertainment, which is understandable since the flight was short lived. It is worth mentioning if you intend to tag a suitcase along as hand luggage, they will collect it pre-flight and you shall receive it on arrival since the overhead cabins cannot accommodate larger suitcases.

When my father arrived at the Cape Town airport he asked for his one crutch to be put in the hold as using both on the plane is very difficult, they staff proceeded to tell him he would have to get it checked as abnormal and made him walk across the airport with no assistance, I wouldn't think trying to help someone on crutches that is in pain would be such a hassle. My sister requested my father to be put in a seat where he could stretch out his leg as it pain horribly when he sits for to long, but no they said to her of course and proceeded to put him somewhere where his leg was crushed thank heavens a kind man offered to swap seats so my father's leg could stretch out no help from the air crew though. When he landed this side I picked him up and the crutch that was put into the hold was stuck into the smallest setting, and it was so stuck I even tried to ask the one airport worker if they could help he could not even get it lose thankfully my uncle was able to use his vice to fix the crutch so my father could again use both instead of the one crutch as he only uses one crutch for short times as using only one hurts his leg far to much. My sister complained to Airlink after his flight about all of this and all they said is they offered a crutch and he refused which he did not as he would have loved a wheelchair as he was in immense pain due to all of this. AirLink obviously looks down on the disabled and when sia personally complains they blame it all on the disabled person, this blatant ableism is sickening I always thought basic compassion and some hint of humanity would win out to help someone who is struggling and in pain but I was horribly wrong.",False,,Business,Economy Class,Cape Town to Johannesburg,July 2022,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",1,4,,False,3

"""overall this was a nightmare""",4,2021-11-16,"Understaffed and poor internal communications - lost essential baggage for a short business trip. I recently made a business trip to Cape Town for a conference. One of my bags therefore contained marketing material (rollup banners). I checked these bags in in Maputo, they were treated as normal hold baggage. I was advised that I needed to collect the bags in person at Johannesburg airport and re-check them in for the leg to Cape Town. Upon arrival at Johannesburg, the bag containing the banners did not appear - either at the carousel or the fragile/oversized baggage counter. When I attempted to make a baggage claim, the SA Airlink baggage claim desk was unstaffed. I therefore had to pass through customs and look for another desk. The transit desk was also unstaffed. I reached the main ticket office, which was fully staffed, however the staff there would not assist me, and sent me to a check in counter. The staff at the check in counter tried to phone their colleagues in the baggage team, however there was no answer. As my connecting flight was due to board, the staff member advised me to rush through security in order to reach the boarding gate. She promised to try to find the bag. I asked her for my claim number, however she stated that I should send an email to report my claim. I asked her why she herself could not send an email, at which point she stated that she could not help me further, since she did not have a computer. As I boarded the flight I asked the gate staff if my bag had been found but she was not interested and just wanted to get people on board. Upon arrival in Cape Town, again I tried to contact SA Airlink staff to discover if the bag had been found, however there were no SA Airlink staff in the whole airport. Upon arrival at my hotel I received a call that the bag had been found in Johannesburg, and was probably at Cape Town airport. However there were no staff there to confirm. I was given a number to call early the next morning. I called it multiple times, however it never answered. Late in the morning I got through to a number in Johannesburg, where a staff member admitted that they were having difficulty contacting the Cape Town airport branch and promised to call me back. On this day, I had to attend the conference at which I needed to display the banners. I ended up having to get alternative (inferior quality) banners printed up in Cape Town, in order to use at the conference. SA Airlink only confirmed that the banners had been found, at the end of the day, when it was too late to be of use. Despite the fact that some of the HQ staff I spoke to were pleasant and seemed to be trying to help, overall this was a nightmare. Two things became clear: a) SA Airlink save money by not having a full complement of staff at the airports - this means that there is no one to assist the passenger in case of problems b) The ground staff appear to be very unhappy and disgruntled, if you have any problem at all they just ""don't want to hear about it"".
