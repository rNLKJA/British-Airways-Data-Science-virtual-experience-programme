"""never use this airline again""",1,2017-02-17,"✅ Verified Review |  Istanbul to Edremit. Borajet cancelled our flight while we were waiting at the gate and about to get to the plane. No representative of Borajet tried to assist us with the inconvenience; they did not even provide information as to how we should get out luggage back, nor did they offer help to make reservation for other flights. It was summer and all other flights of other airlines that we tried to reserve were full. We had to take bus and lost around 10 hours until we reached our destination. I and my husband reported this situation to Turkish Civil Aviation Authority and they ordered Borajet to pay €100 compensation per person due to breach of aviation regulations. We will never use this airline again because they do not respect their passengers.",False,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Edremit,August 2016,3,3,,1,1,,False
