Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,2,2015-07-05,"Flight was delayed 1 hr due to late arrival from Buenos Aires. I used Alitalia Lounge in Terminal 3, modern, large, with limited food options (salads, sandwiches, desserts). I was one of the first to board the plane, so I had to wait almost 30 mins to get any drink/welcome drink, without asking for it, FAs started to give drinks only after boarding was finished. Seat was ok, not full flat, but quite comfy. IFE very poor, only 5 channels available, showing only 2 movies in Spanish/English version, no Air Show with a map available, so had no idea about flight time etc. Cabin crew were nice and smiling, quite senior and during breakfast service, looking very tired and grumpy. Disappointing menu - I was expecting some local dishes from Argentina, some beef etc, and I got green salad with parma ham, risotto or pork with ratatuille or ravioli. I tried first two - all tasted the same, bland, boring, over cooked. No cocktail service at all, as only whisky is available. Good wines. Service in business class is very old fashioned, reminds me service from the 90s, nothing modern as for plating, food presentation, menu etc. Dirty toilet in Business Class. Breakfast started 2 hrs before landing, again - boring tray with fruit salad, yoghurt, bread roll and almost shapeless croissaint, jam and hot omlet with... carrots. Horrible. Generally, very poor business class product. No PA from pilots for whole flight.

My husband is 6 feet tall and his legs were touching the front seat he had no space to move them. I am 5'5 and was also uncomfortable. It was a long flight almost 9 hours and the TV screens did not function properly. Mine had no image whatsoever. My husband's screen had image but no sound. No entertainment at all for almost 9 hours is ridiculous. We had to take a second flight from Buenos Aires to Bahia Blanca and the flight was delayed 2 hours. On our return from Buenos Aires to Miami the flight was also delayed this time for 1 hour. Even tough the prices of Aerolineas Argentinas are lower I would never use it again or recommended to anybody.

Well I'm happy to report that with Aerolineas Argentinas you don't ""get what you pay for"" you get much more.

But the staff handled us well. Flight out left on time but no accommodations for Sky Priority passengers. Charge the gate at JFK was more like it. The food was very good. Service is prompt in that every flight attendant worked to get the job done so they could disappear. We liked how they gave us 3 options for our meals. The ice cream for desert and/or cheese plate were fantastic. And it is true they don't offer mixed drinks. For water they gave us a bottle for the over night flight. Breakfast was again very prompt well presented and the crew when prompted did go the extra step. On the return our child's vegetarian meal was missing. The crew promptly reviewed the menu and told us additional items we could choose from. For the return our flight was changed to add a stop at BRC. At which time we were notified our return to JFK was delayed from 11 pm to 6 am. Sky Priority line did nothing to help us here. We had to suffer with the rest. However they did rebook our last segment with Delta for us and effectively communicated to the crew in JFK to assist us and they did! They offered us a hotel and dinner in EZE. As we missed our JFK connection back to MSP they put us up in NYC and paid for dinner there as well. We turned down the offer for the hotel room in EZE and were able to sleep in the Club Condor Lounge. This is easily better than most First Class Lounges I have seen. Aerolineas in my opinion did much more than Delta United or American would have done for us. Our kids got to spend time touring NYC for the night. Our only downside was the plane could have been cleaner. Sad for a new A330-200. Here the domestic carriers do a better job.

A small snack was served by very friendly cabin staff and all was well until the beverage cart rolled by and we asked for some Malbec wine and were told that Aerolineas do not serve wine on domestic flights! One can imagine my surprise that after paying USD $992 per ticket that the flag carrier of Argentina which grows some of the world's finest wines does not showcase this product onboard-they did not even give us the option to purchase wine on a two hour flight!

I put the seat into a cradle configuration and was able to relax more and sleep for several hours. The food needs improvement - presentation taste and variety were all lacking and considering the price paid to sit upfront I expected better. The entertainment system was good.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,2,2014-08-26,I flew MIA-EZE-MIA round trip on Aerolineas Argentinas (AeroA) December 24 2013 returning January 7 2014. I bought the ticket online but their website is not set up to allow you to select your seat. So I called their 800 number in the US. I called for 3 days several times each day before someone answered the phone. This agent's English was so bad it took 20 minutes to select my seats. EZE airport check-in at Buenos Aires is chaos. On AeroA all passengers for the MIA flight stood in a single line to be checked-in for only that flight. The same for other flights. We found this out by asking other passengers what to do as there were no AeroA employees or announcement boards present. There were long long lines of passengers snaking through the terminal. Check-in was so slow we were concerned we would miss our flight even though we arrived 2 hours early. It didn't matter though because our flight was delayed 3 hours on a crystal-clear morning. When we arrived at MIA 3 hours late the AeroA gate agents had gone home and there was no one to help us with rebooking our connections to Chicago. The planes both ways were run-down and old on the inside. On the way down a ceiling panel rattled the entire 9 hours. The entertainment system did not work either direction. The flight attendants only appeared 4 times in 9 hours: to serve drinks after takeoff to serve and collect dinner serve and collect breakfast and hand out immigration and customs forms. My advice: 1) Do not fly Aerolineas Argentinas for any reason even if you have to change your travel plans to avoid them or pay more on another airline. 2) If you are unlucky enough to use them and have to fly out of Buenos Aires EZE airport arrive 3 hours early and prepare for the slowest and most disorganized check-in procedure you have ever experienced. 3) If you do not speak Spanish then you will receive only limited customer service on the phone and their web site is primitive. 4) Prepare yourself for old tatty airplanes with no working entertainment system and largely-invisible flight attendants.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,False,

The menu says only one appetizer (no choice) and 3 main courses. Two options are for the breakfast time. The whole experience with the catering was horrible. From the presentation to the quality the food did not respond to a business class. Do not expect to have any cocktails since they only have wine beer and whisky. The dessert was a piece of rock (ice cream) and we received hard croissant and bread in our breakfast.

Their toll-free number is not manned 24 hours a day astonishing. On our plane to Buenos Aires none of the in-flight video worked for the entire flight. There was a loose panel in the ceiling over an aisle and it rattled the whole 9 hours. The food was mediocre even by airline standards. The flight attendants were businesslike but disinterested. The plane was only about 1/2 full but the FA's were often nowhere to be seen. Our flight back was 3 hours late leaving EZE after a chaotic check-in at the filthy Ezezia airport. At Ezezia you do not stand in one line for all flights and go to the next available agent. Instead there are separate lines for each flight no indication of which line you should stand in and the agents appear when they feel like it. There was no explanation for the delay and no apologies.

There is no online check-in option for this flight and no seats are allocated prior to check-in so though you should only need to be there 2/3 hours before for an international flight I actually was told to get there 4 hours before just to get a decent seat and even then I queued for nearly an hour to check-in. Boarding was smooth and uneventful. The plane was clean but old. The in-flight entertainment system is horrendous. Considering this is a 15 hour direct flight there is no seat-back entertainment system. There is one large monitor at the front of the cabin and a few smaller ones spaces sporadically. The picture quality is terrible obviously no option to select subtitles if you are not a Spanish speaker. The movies were the same two films on repeat for the 15 hours. Nothing else. The food was adequate though the ran out of some food options leaving my companion to eat vegetarian or nothing else. Obviously the wine is good - it's Argentinean - but the drinks are just served with meals. If you press your call button it is ignored and switched off. I gave up trying to get some water. Breakfast was terrible none of it was edible. Flying back EZE-SYD was not much better. Check-in was a little easier and fortunately this time I managed to get a window seat. Upon boarding I discovered the plane was not full so I had two seats to myself. The only good thing to happen on this flight. The food was just as bad the availability or lack thereof of drinks was the same as before. The toilets were filthy and were obviously not checked or cleaned during the flight.

The cabin was dirty pieces of sticky food on the small video screen. Numerous AR employees and ex employees meandering around the business class cabin socializing with flight attendants and members of the crew certainly not helping the already poor service they were delivering. Multiple FAA safety violations. Example: people standing while the aircraft was moving luggage obstructing the pitch during take-off and landing etc. Service was awful. In addition to leaving 5 hours late it took them 2-3 hours to serve the first drink. When they finally came by with drinks I ordered a whisky. The flight attendant explained they did not serve whisky until after lunch and that that she did not have any whisky in her cart. She did not have the Shiraz wine that they listed on their menu either so I settled for whichever red wine she could give me. Lunch was mediocre and immediately after the service all flight attendant disappeared for about 7 hours until they brought the ""snack"". Not even a glass of water throughout the flight. Finally while sleeping the flight attendant woke me up because the back of my seat was ""bothering"" the passenger behind me probably because the seat was ""defective and reclined too much"".

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,2013-12-25,Took seven domestic flights on Aerolineas Argentinas during December 2013. Of the seven one (Salta to Buenos Aires) was cancelled but postponed as a new flight the second (from Buenos Aires to Trelew on the same date) was cancelled and the passengers left on the airport overnight for 10 hrs. There were no announcements and the new flight never appeared on the board. We were given a chance of free dinner at a pizza place on the airport but no hotels. We foreigners pay more than twice of what locals pay!,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,2013-12-20,Traveling with my children from NY to Córdoba via Buenos Aires. The NYC-EZE flight was delayed more than 8 hours. Luckily they emailed me before I set off to JFK airport. The problem is that they forgot that we had a connecting flight and did not make any provisions at all. Calling the Call Center to try to find out what to expect once in Ezeiza (stranded for 24 hours with two young kids? sent to a hotel? put in a different flight from the domestic airport?) was total waste of time. They don't even bother to pick up the phone. In summary: only fly Aerolineas Argentinas if no other option is available. They are unreliable have no customer service whatsoever and will not hesitate to leave you stranded. And never expect an apology.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,1,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,9,2013-12-05,I flew from Sydney to Buenos Aires and then to Bogota with Aerolineas Argentinas last week and then returned the same way a few days later.

They were award tickets through Sky Team (Delta) points.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,2013-11-22,I've flown this airline 12 times. Something bad has happened every single time. Aerolineas Argentinas has a near-monopoly in many Argentinean markets which is very unfortunate. On my most recent trip the flight schedules were changed an astounding 6 times within 3 months of departure with the final one being a cancellation of my flight and a new departure from a different airport. Once you do have an actual confirmed flight the chances of it leaving on time are close to zero. My personal record was an 8-hr delay causing me to miss my connecting flight back to the US.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,5,2013-11-20,Flew Sydney - Buenos Aires and Buenos Aires - Sydney. Pros: Staff helpful. Good value for money. Cons: Seats are old and sometimes broken.

Mixed experience first flight left at 2.40am from Rio to Buenos Aires on an Austral Embraer 190 and due to heavy turbulence there was no inflight service whatsoever on the 3 hour flight no apologies at all from the crew which I found rude. Short hops from BA to Montevideo and back uneventful. The return legs were better. Flights left and arrived on time crews on both Embraer 190 (Austral) and B737 did their job well.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,2013-11-06,The flight from Sydney to Buenos Aires was awful - the food was disgusting the toilets were not cleaned for hours - hence the smell. No entertainment other than outdated TV hanging from ceiling distorted picture and mainly in another language that could not understand. Seat in front of me was broken and was on a constant lean. The staff or should I say lack of it spent more time talking to one another or reading a magazine than attending to the passengers. The flight home was no better - it might of been cheaper but had I known what they were like I would of gladly paid the extra and flew with Qantas.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,1,2013-11-05,By far the worst airline I have flown. Flew Sydney to Buenos Aires in a plane that looked like it was from the 60's. It was filthy on the outside and inside was even worse. When I opened my blanket on the plane it smelt. The staff were almost non existent during the entire flight.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,5,2013-10-31,The saying that you get what you pay for is spot on when it comes to Aerolineas. Great value for money if you don't have high expectations of the airline in the first place. Flight to BA was fine. No delays and food ok.

Have to say was very surprised on the outbound flight as the crew were very nice and attentive the food was good and the ""new"" business seat OK. The inflight entertainment was the flight map since nothing else worked. The cabin was tatty but clean so all in all ok marks for that. The return on the other hand lived up to everything I have read. This crew would put to shame any US crew when it comes to sitting in the galley doing nothing. Food was terrible and yep got a thimbleful of wine. Glad it was overnight so I got to try and sleep but that was hard given the number of families that the pilot FA's and gate agents brought up to the business cabin.

Flight was delayed until 9.30am then until 1pm didn't leave Argentina until 2.30pm now stuck in Sydney airport on the floor because Qantas have a cut off time on the weekend and Aerolineas Argentinas managed to get me after the cut off time when I was supposed to be here at 5pm! If there is another airline out from Argentina I would take that instead if this one. Even the flight entertainment is poor. You don't get your own screen so you're stuck watching these old tvs that the worst picture known to man. The only good thing was that I got 2 seats to myself.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,8,2013-10-02,We flew return to Buenos Aries from Sydney. Condor class was not a lot more expensive than economy given the 16 hour trip. We had plenty of leg room and the food was excellent. The seats and everything seemed to function. Flights were on time and our luggage arrived on the carousel. Check in was speedy. As other reviewers noted the planes are old so I needed a cushion for lumbar support and we took tablets with books and movies downloaded. This worked very well with excellent picture and sound quality. Staff perhaps could have done more to keep others under control eg a couple immediately behind us watched videos on their laptop with no earplugs so we got the full sound while we were trying to sleep.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,8,2013-10-02,We recently traveled on 3 domestic flights within Argentina - Buenos Aires - Iguazu - Salta - Buenos Aires. We had no problems with any of the flights. They departed on time and our luggage arrived safely. Check in was super fast. The planes were reasonably modern and staff service OK. Food consisted of a snack box which was adequate for a short haul flight. While the flights were expensive prices were reduced considerably by purchasing discounted tickets before we arrived in Argentina. Given the reviews we were pleasantly surprised with the flights or perhaps we were just lucky. There was certainly nothing wrong with them.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,,,,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,3,2013-09-22,Pretty average flight Sydney-Buenos Aires. No seatback screen food OK. The return flight BA-Sydney was poor.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,7,2013-07-15,Sydney to Buenos Aires return. Plane out very old and needing internal maintenance. A couple of overhead locker taped up with do not use notices. The TV that I could see did not work. Didn't see the cabin staff smile once. Seats are tired and sagged. Food was good though I had taken bits to eat but the meal we got was good. No in flight services after the meal but drinks and snacks available. On the way back we were at the airport 23 hours before the flight (due to our connection) and requested a row of seats together. Couldn't check us in as check-in opened 3 hours before. When we checked in 3 hours before we were sat in different seats over the plane and told there were no available seats! Managed to get the children sat together and myself and my wife were in separate seats. On return the plane was in a slightly better shape a little newer. The TV was working but lost the red so some interesting colours for the films. Reasonable films and one channel in English. Food was again good. The cabin staff were great.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,2013-07-10,Flew home from Sao Paulo to Sydney in January 2012. 4-hour delay departing change of aircraft at Buenos Aires resulted in an 8-hour delay. Passengers asked to wait in a lounge then abandoned. No staff for several hours. After 6 hours we got a rapid announcement in Spanish. Passengers were English-speaking Australians! BA to Auckland was unpleasant. TV screens were not working well. The girl in front of me ordered a vegetarian meal as did I. Of course they did not have it. They never have vegetarian meals. The hostess actually argued with the girl and told her that it was her fault that the meal was not ordered. The final insult was a 4-hour delay at Auckland Airport.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,8,2013-06-28,Flight between Sydney and Buenos Aires was pretty good. Staff were friendly and spoke English! Once I arrived in Buenos Aires this changed. Next flight was to Sao Paulo but they refer to it as San Pablo. This flight was delayed a couple of hours but the staff were pretty good. Once I arrived at Sao Paulo the service was not as good but still okay. Staff seem tired and run down. Staff at the gate could not decide which gate the airline was at. If your a person of English speaking background and don't know much Spanish or Portuguese it pays to find someone to translate. I flew to Curitiba and the service was excellent and staff were friendly! We arrived on time. On the way back my flight got delayed and was going to be diverted from Buenos Aires due to poor weather. A nice stewardess kept me informed of this. Staff were very professional with the delay too. Overall a great experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,2,2013-06-23,Miami to Buenos Aires. The cabin service was a disaster staff treated passengers in a disrespectful manner.

Before buying the ticket I researched the airline so I would know what to expect. It exceeded my expectations. Got the above ticket for AUD 3700.00 The only sectors in economy were AEP-FTE-AEP.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,6,2013-05-26,Australia to Brazil. I had no problems at all during the flight. No delays service wasn't that bad and staff were friendly. I wasn't able to eat the food served because my agent (nothing to do with AA) forgot to send the request for vegetarian food (must be done when the booking is made) and they didn't have much options for non- meat eaters.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,2013-04-28,We flew Club Condor (business class) from Sydney to Buenos Aires and then on Austral (regional airline) to Rio and back. It is obviously an airline of a country in economic crisis. Aircraft used on the SYD-EZE-SYD route is like stepping back into 1975. Big old recliner seats (not flat) 3 scheduled movies on a continuous loop. No laptop power etc. The service is very basic to other carriers. AA club condor service is similar to what's offered in economy on other carriers. This is an extremely long flight close to 16 hours yet AA still doesn't use their brand new Airbus with lie flat beds I believe this is used to Madrid and back for obvious reasons. The crew on all sectors didn't really want to be there. EZE-SYD is one of the longest flights in the world made even longer by the aircraft and the service. We would choose to go with Qantas/LAN via Santiago in future trips to South America.,False,,,Business Class,,,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,2,2013-04-28,Sydney - Buenos Aries 19th March 2013. Quite the worst business class flight we have experienced. Only good things to say about it is it arrived safely on time after a 13 hr.,False,,,Business Class,,,1,,,,2,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,7,2013-04-21,Sydney to Buenos Aires and return in April 2013 in business class. Yes it's an old aircraft and the seats are only the old lounge chair type. Also the entertainment is limited. But they are replacing the A340-200 with a 300 series later this year so that should solve these problems. The business class check in was performed meticulously and lounge access given at both airports. Priority boarding was strictly enforced. The on board service was friendly and very personal. My coat snatched away and hung up as soon as I arrived at my seat. The catering was adequate and appropriate for such a long flight. Main courses were presented and served from a trolley in the cabin. They did offer fast track on departure but not on arrival. Still the airport in Sydney was so quiet it was unnecessary. One small criticism is that the Sydney arrival cards were in Spanish. Not easy for us Aussies. The price paid for the ticket represented unbelievable value. I'd fly the again without hesitation.,False,,,Business Class,,,2,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,5,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,2,2013-04-18,SYD-EZE no online check in a real mess at the check in even though Qantas were doing it. Food out on the night flight was okay but could only have 1 half glass of wine. Trip back again no online check in be at the airport 3 hrs before but had to stand around for 50 mins before any processing began. Was told 3 weeks before the flight it would be delayed 20 mins - got to the Airport it was shown to be 1 hr delay but eventually the 8.30am flight departed at 11am. Food was dreadful but this time could get more than 1 glass of wine. There was no explanation as to why the flight was delayed. Experienced similar on Austral (a subsidiary) had to be there 2hrs before and it still departed late. Iguazu-Salta cheese sandwich offered which was thicker - the bread or cheese?

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,1,2013-04-03,My husband and I recently travelled on Aerolineas Argentinas from Buenos Aires. There was no facility for web check-in or to have our seats pre-allocated prior to check-in. We arrived more than 2 hours prior to the flight to be told that the only way we could sit together was to take 2 middle seats in the centre row of the plane. The A340 has a 2-4-2 configuration. In such a configuration 50% of the seats are aisle seats. However it appeared that almost all had been pre-allocated prior to the ordinary check-in opening. In the end we were offered an aisle and a middle seat in the very back row. It is time that Aerolineas recognized that families are entitled to expect to sit together on long haul flights without having to take the worst seats on the plane. Other airlines manage to do this why cant Aerolineas?,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,3,2013-03-19,SYD-EZE-SYD. Only use AR to get from SYD to EZE if you can't avoid it! The seats are rock hard but with better leg room than many. No on-line check-in or seat selection. No early bag drops on transfers meaning I had to wait for 3 hours at EZE before passing through immigration. (At 2am.) No in-seat entertainment and the two in-cabin screens-and sound - only worked part of the time. The same low res movies shown in both directions. The food coming back from EZE was the worst I have ever had on an airline with a tiny dried-up croissant tiny hard roll and insipid yoghurt offered as breakfast and pasta with a teaspoon of tasteless tomato sauce for lunch. I could not even get any pepper when I asked. Red wine was good though. Food out of SYD was much better. Excellent new terminal C at Ezeiza and 57 nice new aircraft in Argentina - pity these advancements don't extend to the Australian part of the operation.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,3,2013-01-10,Sydney-Buenos Aires. We arrived safely which is about the only good thing I can say about this flight. The first time a crew member smiled was saying goodbye as we left the plane. No IFE to speak of no drinks (water) offered after dinner no snacks lights turned off and staff disappeared.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,5,2012-12-22,I'm a frequent business class customer although on domestic flights this 'business class' turns into 'club economy'.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,7,2012-11-19,Sydney to Buenos Aires. Was travelling on the great unknown with this airline so I kept my expectation's low. Plane full with lots of legroom for 18 year old plane. Food was ok with snacks and drinks which you had to get yourself. Great views of the Antarctica if only the staff would let us see most of the flight the shades were kept down. Bring your own entertainment but they did show a couple of movies.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,9,2012-10-29,After a six month assignment in Argentina flying almost only Aerolineas Argentinas and Austral I was pleasantly surprised with the experience. Almost 30 domestic flights and no cancellations only one significant delay (3 hours) due to airport strike. Service good to excellent free snack (5-8 dollar value to US domestic standards) beverages offered once or twice (even on flights under an hour) Flight attendants friendly and efficient.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,2,2012-10-25,Sydney to Buenos Aires then to Santiago and return. Flying to and from Sydney the seats were very hard and uncomfortable. The plane seemed very old. Inflight entertainment poor quality TV and screen. Food was just bearable. The only flight that left on time was the one out of Sydney. First and last time flying with AA. Delay in BA to Santiago due to not wanting to fuel the plane in the rain. Delay from Santiago to BA no idea why. A supposed delay of 22 mins which turned into just over an hour from BA to Sydney which caused me to miss my connecting flight. So overall not happy with the experience. Also trying to check in at Santiago to fly to BA took the check-in lady well over half an hour.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,8,2012-10-08,Sydney to Buenos Aires return. The aircraft used for this route are old but seats are as comfortable as other airline's with more legroom than most. The meals were adequate if not great with ample self serve snacks. Drinks available throughout the flight and the service was polite and friendly. Taking my own entertainment (on a tablet) was no problem considering the savings being made on the price of the tickets compared to the prices charged by the competition. I also caught several Aerolineas regional flights in South America on new aircraft as it is are in the process of adding new aircraft to its fleet.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,5,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,8,2012-10-08,We flew on direct flights Sydney to BA return in September 2012 - the attraction of a lower business class fare than competitors and a direct flight swayed us into trying the airline. The outward flight left early from Sydney and arrived early in BA. The return flight left 30 minutes late but picked up the time on the way home. On both sectors the service was prompt and efficient. Food and wine was good but not presented as top tier carriers would present. The entertainment system was archaic limited and not on demand. This is well documented by other reviewers. We took kindles and an ipad and once we watched one movie we were quite happy to read and play. Views of the Antarctic ice sheet also kept us amused on the way home. Seats are old style business but we did sleep nearly 9 hours on the night flight on the way over. If this one experience is the norm for this sector I would recommend the business class offering given the price advantages - you can overcome the most significant weakness (IFE) by buying movies for your ipad and you can buy plenty for the saving in air fares.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,5,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,2,2012-09-16,A340-200 SYD-EZE. I felt like I have stepped back in time when flying with this airline. They need to update the seating in the older aircraft. Very little attention is paid to safety carry on bags were left unsecured on seats during take-off. Seats were broken and reclined without pushing the recline button. Despite the seats being broken passengers were permitted to use them. There was no personal entertainment and it is strictly bring your own. Before and soon after take-off the cabin became very cold. Approx 1 hour into the flight the seat belt sign was turned off for the first time shortly after staff delivered the food. There was no choice of meal (chicken or red meat) let alone a vegetarian selection. After dinner the food trays were collected and the lights turned off and all passengers were expected to sleep. The staff must have also turned up the temperature as the aircraft cabin became very hot and stuffy. The flight was 14 hours and passengers were expected to sleep 10 of those hours. Approx 2 hours before landing the lights were turned back on we were fed again and the cabin became very cold. Trays removed just in time to land in Buenos Aires. Staff were seen at the rear of the craft playing on laptops and not offering any drink runs to passengers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,3,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,4,2012-09-06,FCO (Rome) - EZE. The lack of IFE was an obvious flaw but my tablet computer lasted the whole journey so it was ok. The food wasn't great but the white wine was superb. Staff were very nice and even though I was Australian flying from Italy they all spoke perfect English. Flying Aerolineas was very much what it was like to fly domestic in Australia in the nineties - not great but bearable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,7,2012-09-04,I recently flew with AR on the new direct SYD-EZE service. I must say after reading the previous reviews here that I was pleasantly surprised. Flights were on time cabin crew were friendly (more so on the return leg) seat pitch in economy was actually very good cabin was clean and tidy. Yes there are no back of seat entertainment screens but for the price you cannot expect 5 star services. If being entertained is an issue bring your ipad or a good book! Food was OK. On the return flight after dinner service sandwiches were self- served from the rear of the cabin and it would be beneficial here to at least offer a selection (for us veggies rather than the ubiquitous ham and cheese). Overall the flight was as good as any for the price – in fact the worst part was actually going through customs at EZE  which took well over an hour. I thought I had landed at LAX! Overall I would recommend this airline if you are after a well-priced airfare – just don't expect 5 star amenities services for a 3 star price.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,5,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,4,2012-08-28,I flew from Lima to Sydney via Buenos Aires. My flight in Buenos Aires was delayed 1.5 hours but Aerolineas did not communicate with us at all! They announced a couple of times in Spanish thank you for your patience but that was it. Finally when we boarded it took another hour to take off! The people on my flight were complaining of the terrible service they had already experienced with Aerolineas. When I arrived in Sydney I had missed my connecting flight and so had half of the passengers I was with. We all had to pay for new tickets to our next destination which cost me $170 to Melbourne! Their entertainment was poor they played the same movie over and over and when passengers asked for help staff ignored them!

Economy class seats were generously sized and I was offered an emergency exit seat from SYD-EZE. EZE-SYD was a standard economy class seat. Plane departed on time from SYD-EZE and again EZE-SYD. Staff friendly and always walking around. Food was edible but there wasn't much of it. A small self-serve bar in the galley provided water and snacks during the flight. Both flights the plane landed on time and overall was a pleasant experience. Despite being limited in features I got from SYD to EZE and back cheaply comfortably and if you bring your iPad/iPod you'll be entertained. If there was no price difference between AR and LAN/Qantas etc. consider going on the latter. But AR isn't a bad airline provided you've got some personal entertainment on the long 13-15 hour flights. One final point - the AR website is incredibly hard to navigate and use. Calls to their SYD call centre go without answer.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,8,2012-08-28,Well after hearing a lots of negetive comments about Aerlineas airlines I was a bit apprehensive but the fare was almost half from MEL-RIO. I found the service better and aircraft was old but with more legroom. The crew was also good and trying to help passengers as it was a long flight of 16 hrs. Food was OK and they should improve their entertainment service. Overall we enjoyed and would definitely go again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,5,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,1,2012-08-20,They delayed my flight by 3 days and were incredibly rude and unapologetic. I was supposed to fly from Sydney to Buenos Aires via Auckland and Santiago. I turned up at the check in counter in Sydney and was told the flight would be delayed because the plane hadn't arrived yet from Auckland but it would only be a couple of hours. When I returned they said the plane would not be arriving after all and that we would not leave Sydney for another two days. Staff were rude and unhelpful and once we were taken to the accommodation we didn't hear from them again except for a piece of paper under the hotel door telling us to be ready at 5am. After two days we went back to airport there was no staff member there and we had to go from counter to counter trying to find out which flight we were on. After finally checking in and going through immigration we were at the boarding gate when we were told that we would not be flying out after all as there was no plane to meet us in Auckland. No staff representative. I ended up changing to LAN Chile who were excellent.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,1,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,6,2012-07-26,Return flight (Sydney-Buenos Aires). The fare was really competitive. Flight left on time from Sydney to Buenos Aires. Food was below average (Fish and rice for dinner and very small sandwiches for breakfast and middle snack). On board entertainment is the worst entertainment I have witnessed. Flight attendants were nice. On my way back flight delayed 30 minutes. Food was good (Chicken and rice for lunch. Croissant tea and fruits for breakfast and small chicken sandwich for middle snack). On board entertainment was better than the first flight. Pros: Excellent price - On time flights - Friendly staff. Cons: No personal entertainment nor good screens - Bad food on first flight - Staff didn't allow me to use my iphone in flight mode - not very tidy (though not dirty).,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,5,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,7,2012-07-25,SYD-EZE on July 21. While the aircraft was old and it lacks personal inflight entertainment it was well maintained. Good legroom. Crew were friendly and efficient. Left on time and arrived one hour early. All and all a good experience and extremely good value for money. I'm looking forward to my return in a few days.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,5,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,4,2012-07-15,Flew AKL-EZE/AEP-GIG-AEP/EZE-AKL. Both long-haul legs were close to being on time but the baggage wait in BA was around 40 min (thus missed the transfer bus to the other airport in BA and had to get a cab). Upon arrival at AEP I was checked-in for the flight to Rio as normal. But 20 min after the schedule boarding time everyone was informed that AR decided to switch the departing airport back to EZE (and this is already at 10pm). So had to re-clear the custom collect our baggage wait for 30 min for the bus take the 1 hour bus ride to the other side of the town re-check in and re-clear the custom at EZE (which took 1 hour). Finally landed in Rio at 3.30am 4 hours late. No compensation was offered whatsoever. The return flights were relatively stress-free. Overall the cabin service was above average but planes are antiquated with no personal entertainment but a leaky roof. Breakfast on the 13 hour long-haul consisted of two pieces of cold bread and a banana. Much cheaper than LAN but definitely not worth the money paid.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,1,2012-07-15,Was booked on the flight on the 13th of July from EZE-SYD (which does not go via AKL anymore). I checked- in and everything was confirmed with my seat etc. I was at the airport at 6am for the 8.30am flight. After 1 hour in line I was only half way down the queue. A little bit later other passengers bound for SYD were denied access. The following reason was given: the weather pattern on the route to SYD. Therefore they had to get rid of weight to have a lighter aircraft to make it the entire way. Later we learnt that they had given freight/cargo priority and consequently 80 of us were stranded with the next flight due 3 days later which only had 40 free spots. The employees only spoke Spanish which was hard for people who didn't know the language. Lots of ideas were thrown around but evidently the flight left without us. I had checked the flight the days/weeks before I was due to fly it and noticed that the flight always left EZE delayed by 1-2 hours which could be for similar reasons. Maybe they should go back to flying via AKL to be able to accept all the paid passengers. Their compensation was not good either and I (and several others) decided we wanted a full refund.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,1,,,,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,2,2012-07-13,SYD-AKL-BA return. Very old aircraft untidy and looked quite dirty. No personal entertainment unit. Surly cabin crew with very poor service standards. Hardly saw FA's for the entire flight and no effort was made to prepare the cabin for landing. I also took an internal flight with this airline from BA to Ushuaia. On this flight the service was just as bad and my seat was broken. I will never use this airline again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,2,2012-06-25,We had a scheduled flight from AEP (Buenos Aires) to Resistencia. When we checked in we were told that the flight was on time. Just before boarding time we were told that the flight was cancelled. We were told that all flights were full for 3 days but they would work on something. Long story short we stayed overnight at the airport (with 5 children) and the next day we were flown to Corrientes instead of Resistencia. We received nothing in compensation - no vouchers for food hotel or transportation - and not for lack of persistent trying. We did not even receive transportation cost for travel from Corrientes to Resistencia! We would never recommend this airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,8,2012-06-17,Buenos Aires to Salta to Iguazu. Bit apprehensive after reading reviews but both flights were fine. Punctual efficient and even a decent snack.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,8,2012-06-13,I have flown a number of long distance and internal flights and am pleased with the airline. The international flight has the biggest leg room and is very comfortable. No TV's but not a problem - bring your own entertainment. Food is mediocre but drinks are served regularly. Internal flights are good - they new Embraers are great and the new B737's have suitable legroom. The Virgin sourced planes are tight in terms of legroom. The website is great and service when things go wrong is also friendly and good.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,3,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,2,2012-06-11,Business Class return Sydney to Sau Paulo. Great price but pretty basic for the class paid. Worst was the return trip my agent had booked the ticket and I hadn't noticed that the flight home via Buenos Aires landed and took off from different airports. I thought they would arrange transfers - wrong. After much complaining they arranged a transfer with another bus company. We were lucky but others (including a mother and small child) got no guidance and had to get taxi's.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,1,2012-06-07,Horrible food hot plane (and I feel the cold) seat didn't recline. No personal IFE had to watch a tiny screen at front of plane one movie wasn't in English. Didn't see staff much so couldn't get drinks. All flights delayed at both Auckland BA for 6 hrs each. Given measly meal voucher at BA that bought me nothing much. BA Airport was horrible and staff unhelpful. I had no personal effects for 24hrs once I arrived in Rio. I flew them to save $1000 over LAN Chile whom I will fly with next time and just spend the extra.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,9,2012-05-29,MIA-EZE round trip and AEP-UAQ. Service on the long haul was great from reservation process through check- in and inflight. Airbus 340 from and back to Miami had spacious economy class seats and attentive flight attendants. Onboard entertainment on the long haul was rudimentary at best and food was the worst airline food ever. Embraer 190 used on subsidiary Austral between AEP and UAQ was clean: spacious and had in- seat state of the art entertainment and refreshments. Had mobility issues and Aerolineas staff went the extra mile to take care of me.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,2,2012-05-02,Flew Sydney to BA via Auckland return plus BA to Lima return. Except for BA to Sydney no onboard entertainment and food inedible. Cabin temperature ranged from acceptable to unbearably hot. Service non existent.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,4,2012-03-08,MAD-EZE return plus 6 internal flights. Seats a bit worn but everything else OK. Internal flights a nightmare due to constant delays and cancellations. Due to cancellation they paid for 2 free hotel nights + dinner. When we decided to skip one of our destinations there were no sales people available to make the change. The change was done by check-in staff who were very friendly but clueless. It turned out they forgot to delete the one leg thus the system counted us as no-show and cancelled our tickets for the flight back!

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,2,2012-03-01,Flight from Bariloche to Buenos Aires delayed 7 hours because of weather.

There is no VIP saloon at this airport for Club Economy passengers. Equipment was an old MD88 that was worn. No IFE. Seat pitch was around 35” or so. A lunch box was distributed shortly after take off - a stale sandwich a packaged cake and a pack of nuts. Drink service followed and FA's disappeared. No second round of drinks. Toilet was dirty.

We sat all day at the gate in SYD eventually told flight cancelled due to mechanical problem. After spending 2 nights we left SYD last night only to land in Auckland for 16 hour layover due to crew shortages. No communication other than rumours from hotel staff.

No updates from the airline board still read on time. Missed connection in Buenos Aires no Business Class line rep tells me she can't help me reschedule my flight. No offer of meal tickets no lounge access they bump me to economy class and refuse to refund the difference - finally part with a voucher for a disgusting fast food place at the airport then the flight to Ushuaia is delayed 2 hours.

Auckland to BA - toilet out of order. Return flight 7 weeks later same toilet out of order. Ceiling mounted TV was flickering for 13 hours. Service - rude. Movies - they only had 2. They lied to us about how long our flight would be delayed so they wouldn't have to pay for meals and accommodation. When we returned to the airport we found it was further delayed. We paid for 7 flights with AA and they changed departure and arrival times on us and in BA also switched arriving airports which meant we had to cross town to make our connecting flight.

I pre-booked vegetarian meals months ahead and confirmed at check-in 3 hours prior to departure. But my name was not on list. The plane was old with poor TV and disappearing staff.

When we booked flights in Australia we chose our seats and our choice apparently accepted. We reconfirmed this at check-in but upon entering the aircraft we discovered this not to be the case and we were not even sitting together. On the first flight the audio did not work on my seat and on the other the visuals were running without audio. Staff tried to speak English but generally had a poor capability so communicating in Spanish was more effective. Some staff were unfriendly and all staff disappeared for about five hours after serving the meal on leaving BA. Snacks and drinks were available in the galley areas but this was not announced so passengers only found out about it through diffusion.

There was a single screen for entertainment but no headphones were passed out during one flight until the movie had run! The movies were old. The food was decidedly average. The plane fittings appeared old - my seat bottom was entirely loose from its frame and two of the bathroom doors I used wouldn't close properly. The toilets were not serviced at all during the long 12 hours flights so they were pretty horrible by the end. The crew were friendly and bilingual but once meals were served they did not really appears. I wouldn't seek to fly with this airline again unless there were no other options.

But the price difference compared to other airlines more then made up for it. Foods was ok and the staff were good and if your prepared with a book then this is good value. Because the planes are older there is actually pretty good leg room in Economy. On my return I'd been travelling for 32hrs and they gave me an unexplained upgrade to Business Class.

Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,1,2011-07-28,New Zealand to Buenos Aires. They cancelled our flights and had wait hours in Argentina. The crew were not polite they did not provide accommodation and did not listen to our complaints. I needed to call to New Zealand to get someone from Aerolineas to answer my queries.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,2011-07-25,Rude Staff old aircraft Lost our bags but didn't care why. We were left in New Zealand and passengers weren't advised of new flight time on different airline - the whole team disappeared from airport and left passengers wondering what to do. We had to pay $100 to get our bags to Sydney with Air NZ because they have a different baggage allowance. Little customer service skills.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,4,2011-07-21,Santiago-Buenos Aires-Rome and back. The planes are evidently old and the entertainment system is very mediocre especially for a 13+ hr trip. The food given was good enough and the crew was nice although they didn't offer anything unless you asked them. The biggest problem was the schedule on my return flights the plane from Rome to Buenos Aires was delayed 6 hrs we had to wait 6 more hrs in Buenos Aires to get back on a plane to Santiago (delayed an extra hour). They were good enough to move me and my sister to Business Class from Rome to Buenos Aires because of the problems although this was possible only because my dad and uncle were in Business already. Business class didn't offer many improvements in comparison to other airlines the seats although more comfortable than the Economy ones weren't as good as other airlines and the entertainment system was almost the same as in Economy.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,2011-07-04,I have travelled many times with this airline and have not had any problems. However I am disgusted with the way that the airline has handled the problem with the Volcano in Chile. I understand that flights need to be cancelled but Aerolineas is not communicating with its passengers and is also not making any attempts to help those trapped in Argentina due to flight cancellations. The staff were very rude even getting up and walking away. It is such a disappointment to see the way that passengers are being treated. Those of us trying to reschedule our flights are having problems getting through to the call centre. Very unprofessional.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,9,2011-07-03,There seems to be a polarity of views on AR between Australia/New Zealand based travellers and those who use AR regularly for domestic and regional services. It may be the case that both are right but for fairness I have to say that in 15 yrs of domestic flights and regional services to/from Brazil and Paraguay I have never experienced more than 30 mins delay and have always received good service in Economy class.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,10,2011-06-30,I have travelled several times with Aerolineas. Buenos Aires-Rio De Janeiro and Montevideo. Domestically I have flown between Buenos Aires and Mendoza Cordoba and Salta. I only have praise for the staff and organisation of this airline. I have encountered polite efficiency from check in staff and air crew the aircraft were clean and I experienced no delay or problems with the flights.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,2011-06-09,This is by far the worst airline. Rude staff most dilapidated aircraft and 13 hours late - need I go on. Cheap rates but not cheap enough.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,2011-06-01,During our holiday in Argentina we were unlucky to have several flights with Aerolineas Argentinas. They are by far the worst airline I have experienced. It is a very poorly run state owned airline acting like a monopolist. Customers are treated like dirt. Staff at check in is rude (Puerto Iguazu was the only exception). Flights are nearly always delayed without any explanation given or sometimes cancelled altogether. Even worse some of its planes are in very poor condition and seem utterly unsafe. Follow the advice of some Argentinians I met : always avoid them. It is better to spend 24 hours in a bus (they are very comfortable) than 2 hours with Aerolineas.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,2011-05-22,The food was basic but acceptable. Astonished by rudeness of the cabin crew no service at all we were not greeted on the aircraft or off. Crew ignored our need for a glass of water my seat was broken no film or music for a 4 hour flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,9,2011-05-14,AEP to Calafate Calafate to Ushuaia: Ushuaia to AEP. I was surprised at the overall quality of the Aerolineas Argentinas operations : online check-in inflight service from friendly and professional crew and the snacks including the quick Calafate to Ushuaia hop. The radar went down at Ushuaia and AR sent three bus loads of passengers on a four hour bus ride to Rio Grande through a heavy mountain snow. As the buses arrived in Rio Grande the Aerolineas Argentinas flight landed and a completely full flight was airborne for AEP in less than an hour.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,1,2011-04-29,We spent 4 weeks in Argentina and took 5 flights with is airline. In this time they lost my baggage for two days cancelled one flight with no previous notice delayed two times and worst of all the last airplane we took tried to depart and stop last minute twice due to technical difficulties. We had to wait for 24 hrs for them to fix it and lost our connections to Mexico. The company refused to assist us to solve any problem and kept saying : there's nothing we can do present your claim on line. I will never flight with Aerolíneas Argentinas again!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,2,2011-04-29,"Aeroparque-Montevideo return  4 people at the check-in 2 of them working. The rest doing everything to avoid the customer. Although arriving 2h before departure we almost missed our flight. The queue became so long that locals started fighting with the personnel since they lost their flights due to Aerolineas Argentinas ""I dont care attitude"". Service onboard is a plastic bag with juice and a fruit-bar. Flight attendants friendly. A country like Argentina does deserve a better airline.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,8,2011-04-24,EZE to Santa Cruz. Everything was fine - no queue to check in flight was on time decent snack on board and aircraft reasonably new. So nothing special but nothing to complain about either.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,1,2011-04-19,Flight suspended in Aukland for 24hrs due to an industrial dispute (they told us it was due to an engineering issue but we found out later this was a lie). Although we were put up in a hotel room it still lost us one day out of 10 of our hard saved visit to relatives. Waited in Auckland airport for 8 hrs before they ferried us out to hotel - dinner at 3am and had to be awake by 8 to go again (we had kids with us). Flight home was delayed again at Argentina (captain turned up 2 hours late).,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,7,2011-04-11,MAD-EZE return. On the upper deck on the way to Argentina: service was good food as well - seat worked and slept nearly the whole flight. On the way back on the much smaller lower deck flight attendant was somewhat short-sighted and set everyone in wrong seats - we had our laughs. Seat was a bit broken but found some sleep. Food wasn't so good on the flight back to Europe.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,2011-04-07,Came To Argentina for vacations. The first flight (Bogota to Buenos Aires) suffered a 12 hour delay four internal flights in Argentine were all delayed (hours of delay) and the last one (Iguazu to Buenos Aires) was cancelled! They took us to a filthy hotel in Iguazu. With these problems it is not worth to talk about service or food.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,3,2011-04-06,I've flown from Auckland to Sao Paulo and return twice with this airline over the last four years - best thing is the price. Food acceptable - I'm not fussy about food. Staff inclined to be offhand and more interested in socialising among themselves. Announcements very thickly accented English - difficult to comprehend at times. Cabin interior - on my first trip the reading light came away in my hand and the projected movie seemed to have been soaked in bleach before screening. On the second trip there was no film at all with no explanation or apology from the crew. Lateness - first trip OK. Second trip a shocker. Six-hour delay in leaving due to unspecified technical difficulties. On late arrival in Buenos Aires confusion reigned with passengers asking each other what was going on as most connections had been missed. By a mysterious process (no thanks to the airline's staff) I found myself on a coach with other mystified passengers thinking we were heading to a hotel for the night (it was very late). Instead we were taken to another airport and hastily put aboard another plane. I got to Brazil but landed in the wee small hours and faced an uncomfortable night sleeping on the floor of the terminal. Aerolineas thereby escaped having to foot the bill for hotel rooms.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,7,2011-04-03,AEP-FTE via Ushuaia check in chaotic use web check in! New B737-700 nice crew on both legs drinks and food service (cakes cereal bar) nice flight on time arrival. Surprised reading other reviews or lucky. Price for internal flights quite high.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,2011-03-29,Last minute surprise cancellations and huge delays are routine in Aerolineas Argentinas. My short vacation last long weekend was ruined by this airline. Both flights BUE-COR and return COR-BUE were cancelled. In the first I returned to fly next day. In the second (COR-BUE) they sent me by bus (800km). Check with a knowledgeable and honest travel agent before becoming their hostage.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,1,2011-03-27,Flew 4 legs from Santiago to Iguazu. First one cancelled and we took next flight 3 hours later. Second one was delayed. The same with third flight. The last one also delayed before we could board and once onboard we had to stay sitting in the plane at Buenos Aires airport for more than an hour in a very warm day.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,8,2011-03-27,EZE-COR and back new Austral E-190 with good legroom and interesting IFE. The flight is only an hour long so I wasn't expecting food the snack provided was decent. Used the web check-in so airports were a breeze. The staff and cabin crew was friendly and energetic. However they still have punctuality issues: both my flights were 30 minutes late and screens at the airport showed that many of their flights were delayed too.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,2011-03-14,"We have scheduled to fly 6 legs on this airline and unfortunately have flown 7. Five flights were delayed by over an hour and delays averaged 2 hours late. Each time the website reported an on-time takeoff when we checked prior to departing for the airport. The last time we flew this airline we checked the status prior to departure and it stated ""on-time"" for our flight from AEP to GIG. When we arrived at the airport the screens stated ""on-time"" finally after an hour in a line that did not move we noticed a crowd at one ticket counter and went to investigate. Our flight had been cancelled without an announcement. They rebooked us for a flight that left from a different airport and that took a detour through Sao Paulo. Our more expensive direct flight from AEP to GIG turned into a 13 hour marathon with us arriving in Rio de Janeiro seven hours late at 2:30 am in the morning. I will not fly this airline again.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,4,2011-02-26,Flew domestic with Aerolineas Argentinas on 5 occasions in the space of 3 weeks. Flight length was between 2 and 3hours each time. On every occasion the flight departure was at least 45mins or more delayed. Planes were generally older (late 80's early 90's) MD-90's. Inflight entertainment is non existent and the food served well below average. The problem in Argentina is that apart from the occasional LAN route Aerolineas sit on the whole domestic market so there is generally no choice of carrier.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,2011-02-15,I had the misfortune to fly this airline Sydney to Buenos Aires landed in Auckland where the plane had a mechanical problem no communication left waiting at the airport for hours before our tour guide got them to provide accommodation for the night. The plane we flew was very old had no inflight entertainment and the crew were rude. The flight crew left the seat belt sign on for most of the flight. My advice - give them a wide berth.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,2011-01-31,Terrible experience - we flew Buenos Aires to Ushuaia and returned 3 weeks later. Both time the flight was delayed by 5 hours. They seem to cancel flights until the plane is full and then let it go. Cabin staff and ground staff could not care less a very poor attitude. Horror stories from many other passengers about lost luggage. I would avoid using them at all cost.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,7,2011-01-25,AKL-SYD one way. I booked this flight with pretty low expectations. The flight was 90 minutes late. However this flight was better than expected. A340s used on this route are old. However the seats were comfortable and leg room acceptable. The complimentary light meal coffee and juice were tasty and appreciated. The cabin crew's English was quite good - some of the crew were young and friendly while there were a couple of more experienced and more gruff senior crew who shouted orders. All PAs are given in Spanish first then English. It was very hard to understand the English notices as the English spoken was heavily accented. There are no personal TVs and on this three hour sector no movies were shown - just the route map on the main screens. Their service is significantly lower quality than their main competitor LAN but they are also significantly cheaper. I think it would be less comfortable to fly the much longer AKL-EZE sector on this airline but for AKL-SYD they were fine.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,8,2011-01-14,MAD to BUE and back in economy class. B747-400 used were really old no personal screens in the seatbacks only small ceiling screens. Furthermore on MAD-BUE flight the inflight entertainment system gave up working shortly after the safety movie so no movie or Airshow at all. Meal/drink service was absolutely minimal no drinks at all during both 12h night flights. Cabin announcements unmotivated and in bad English. The old fashioned seats were very comfortable. great legrooom and recline. Bring your own food drinks and entertainment don't expect anything special from the cabin crew but enjoy the comfy seats which are much better than those ultra-thin seats which most leading carriers offer today.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,2,2010-11-07,SYD to EZE via AKL EZE-BOG via LIM and return. Arrived at Sydney airport at 7am for a morning departure to be told flight will be delayed until afternoon. Provided with a lunch voucher I spent the day at Sydney airport flight finally departed at around 1730. Arriving late to EZE I had missed my prebooked hotel shuttle and complained at the airline counter and they gave me a voucher for a hire car to my hotel which was nice. A340 was old seats were well worn and frayed overhead reading lights didn't work overhead baggage lockers difficult to close ancient entertainment system with flickering screen. Food was passable but nothing special cabin crew looked old and tired and mostly stayed in the galley chatting amongst themselves and were not very attentive. The pillow was so small and flat it was a waste of time as was the small think blanket. Every other flight I had within South America with this airline was very late causing inconvenience and disruption to my travel plans. My return flight to Australia was cancelled and I was driven to a hotel and picked up by bus the next morning only to face more delays uncertainty and poor communication from airline staff. This airline is a joke listen to me and many other people here when we say pay the extra money and fly to South America with LAN or Qantas but avoid Aerolineas Argentinas like the plague.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,9,2010-10-18,ASU-AEP morning flight on time clean and professional. Not many flights between Paraguay and Argentina and this one went into the city airport Aeroparque saving a lot of time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,1,2010-10-15,Auckland to Sydney. On the way there flight was delayed almost two hours. Staff were rude requested a bassinet for my 3 month old When boarded plane was told there was nothing? Flight home delayed two hours again no bassinet. Staff did not smile when needed pressed the button and waited 20 minutes?,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,5,2010-10-12,Plane from Auckland to Buenos Aires was old pocket at back of seat was split so mags etc kept falling out seats frayed and the nearest movie screen didn't work. Inflight service OK there doesn't seem to be a choice of meal and it is just plonked in front of one. But had plenty of room as plane was only half full. Return trip from Montivideo was hours late leaving for Buenos Aires. I had to take a bus to the international airport but as it wouldn't have arrived there till 0100 I had to take a car (shared with another traveller) for the 0200 flight which left at 0430! Plane was better than the first as everything seemed to work. Cabin staff do their job but not so friendly as other air lines. Lights out after dinner and don't see cabin staff much after that but there is water and drinks left in the galley area. Plane late into Auckland so therefore missed connection to Christchurch and had to buy another ticket as I had just got a non transferable thinking 3 hours between flights would be long enough. Air fare was about half the price of the other airline servicing that route. Not sure if I will use them again. Have to be aware of delays and we were not given any explanation as to why it was delayed.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,8,2010-10-03,BUE to MVD so very short flight. Excellent service very friendly staff. Even got a snack in a handy plastic bag to reuse at security next time - nice idea. On return from Montevideo arrived to check in and was offered a seat on a flight leaving one hour earlier. So great experience. Only negative was very complicated booking process. Booked online but then had to call the office here in France to make payment. Not possible either online or through Buenos Aires call centre. Very strange.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,8,2010-08-28,BOG to EZE on a relatively new 737. Flight left on time food decent (two services on this 6 hour flight lunch and snack before landing) although the main lunch was pretty small and all types of drinks free. This airline has a pretty bad reputation for being late but it seems they are buying new planes and things are getting slowly better. For me it was all I could ask for - cheap nonstop and good service. The only change would be to have some sort of in flight entertainment.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,8,2010-07-29,Buenos Aires to Bariloche return and found both the airplane comfortable and the crew very attentive. The snack and beverage services were nice too. There was a delay in the departure from Bariloche to Buenos Aires which seems to be usual in Aerolineas Argentinas. It is said that many passengers choose some other airlines instead of Aerolineas because of the habitual delays. I hope it will become more efficient and competitive in time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,2010-07-26,Buenos Aires to Madrid - flight delayed 9 hours. Then 15 days later I flew from Rome to Buenos Aires the flight was again delayed 10 hours.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,7,2010-07-15,SYD-AKL return. Staff pleasant and polite. Food edible if you are hungry. A good budget airline seats in good condition and comfortable. Only downside would be no in flight entertainment. It wouldn't kill them to put on a movie especially during school holidays.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,8,2010-07-12,Buenos Aires to Calafate economy class. Food and drinks were reasonable. Cabin interior was clean. On return the aircraft was MD80 legroom reasonable but as no entertainment service on this 3 hour flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,8,2010-07-11,Sydney to Auckland. No inflight entertainment just a snack and drinks service and good legroom which Aerolineas have on the A340. Friendly and engaging crew. Overall a good flight and very cheap ticket.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,8,2010-07-11,We flew to and from Madrid and we left and arrived on time. Both trips take about 11 hours and the experience was good. The seat is confortable though it is not a flat bed and the food was good. The plane was a rather old B747.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,2,2010-06-29,Sao Paulo to Buenos Aires. Aerolineas Argentinas now offers service to Aeroparque which is more convenient than Ezeiza. We bought business class tickets. Check-in staff at GRU tells us that aircraft assigned to flight has all-coach cabin offers refund. Same happens on the way back. Strong suggestion that Aerolineas Argentinas is selling tickets to non-existent business class seats.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,8,2010-06-24,Buenos Aires to Sydney via Auckland. Staff were efficient and friendly enough. The food was fine leg room pretty good. Buenos Aires to Auckland after dinner the lights go off and you do not see the staff often after that but water was left out on the tray. TVs only in the centre aisle but audio was in English. Blankets and pillows on the seat. The plane had been around for years though. A negative is at the boarding lounge gate you handheld baggage is searched and they took all my wife's makeup and threw it away they should have provided plastic bags because it needed to be in an individual bag and she was very upset about this.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,5,2010-06-23,Auckland to Buenos Aires. Plane was delayed by five hours after we'd checked in with pretty much no explanation (except that the incoming plane from Sydney was delayed but again no explanation why). We were travelling with two young children so the delays were a bit difficult. Legroom was pretty much as I remember other airlines in economy class. The lack of decent entertainment was a pain (only the old monitors up in the aisles where you had to crane your neck to see) but the kids ended up falling asleep anyway. And the movie they played was in Spanish. Dinner was acceptable. Kids had a kids meal as requested. It was disappointing there was no beverage service during the night for those who were awake. I went hunting for a drink of water hoping they'd give me a bottle to tide me over but no just a cup. Having said all that the staff were reasonably friendly and the fare was much cheaper. It saved us around $1200 as a family. So if you don't mind no-frills it's not a bad choice. The domestic leg from Buenos Aires to Lima was on time and efficient.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
