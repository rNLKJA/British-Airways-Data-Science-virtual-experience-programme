Dessert came around on a trolley - there was a choice of cakes, fruits and cheese. The flight attendant who served me on this flight was a nice Korean lady who was attentive and polite.

"""told that a GDFRA return permit was required""",1,2021-10-25,"On 28 August my wife and I arrived at Istanbul Airport (IST) to check-in for our Gulf Air flight back to Dubai (DXB). We are both residents of the UAE and checked all the return entry requirements to board the flight. This includes a negative PCR Test, residency VISA and a valid passport. This did not include a GDFRA return permit as we had not visited a red zone country in the last 14 days (or in the last six months for that matter). Moreover whilst my wife holds a Dubai VISA, I myself have an Abu Dhabi residence VISA which means I cannot apply for a GDFRA return permit (as these are only for Dubai VISA holders), but instead can apply for an ICA (Identity and Citizenship Authority) return permit, which is applicable to holders of VISAs issued by all the other Emirates of the UAE, excluding Dubai. We approached the check-in counter at which time we were immediately told that a GDFRA return permit was required for ALL passengers flying to Dubai regardless of VISA. Moreover it was explained to us that all passengers in the previous weeks flying to Dubai had all had GDFRA return permits regardless of VISA (please note that this is impossible due to the aforementioned reason). Despite this situation we indicated that we would attempt to complete the application form online. Even approaching the local merchants to make use of their computers. When this failed the Gulf Air staff indicated that we should speak with the Emirates ticketing office and airline check-in staff (located on the complete opposite side of the airport) as they could explain in better detail the requirements to fly to Dubai. We proceeded to walk with all our luggage and no assistance from Gulf Air to the other side of the airport. However after speaking with the Emirates staff they confirmed our understanding that a GDFRA was not necessary in our circumstance, confirming the initial information in this complaint. Upon return to the Gulf Airline check-in counter we explained to the Counter manager what Emirates had said and we were met with severe hostility. She directed two of her staff to accompany us back to the Emirates check-in counter, telling one of them what we had told her, but in an extremely rude tone indicative of a person who believed that we were lying. My wife even tried to deescalate the situation, but the manager was so incredibly hostile and rude that further communication with her became counter-productive. We therefore proceeded back to the Emirates counter with the Gulf Air Staff, one of whom along the way informed my wife that they did not care for our situation and that we were in fact wasting their time and, as indicated above, reiterated that every passenger going to Dubai in the last few weeks had a GDFRA regardless of the VISA they held. This Gulf Air staff member was so rude he actually stopped assisting my wife with her bag and left us half way. Once back at the Emirates counter the Emirates staff explained to the remaining Gulf Air staff member that had not abandoned us that we did not require a GDFRA, however as the Gulf Air staff was apparently insisting on a document that was impossible to obtain, the Emirates staff themselves attempted to assist us in vain.

"""little glitches Gulf Air should address""",7,2020-03-27,"London to Bahrain in Business Class , Having flown their A330's before, I was looking forward to experience the difference in their 787's. Firstly, the seat is a 2x2x2 configuration, with open suite style seating. The window seats (which I chose), offered privacy once the screen was raised up. And every seat has direct aisle access. The seat is fabulous, comfortable, with all the adjustments including a massage function, except for the headphone socket which was a difficult to see as it was hidden in a darker area by the seat. I loved the windows, which could be darken and lightened. There is little storage space, but if you were not stretching out to a full flat bed, the front area underneath the TV monitor allowed for an ample storage area. The Amenity Kit was basic, but they did provide PJ's even on the daylight flights. However, the IFE is very limited, with a small selection of movies and programmes. Service was a mixed bag. While welcoming and friendly, the cabin crew were non-engaging, instead providing the service in a professional and swift manner. There were the usual welcome drinks including champagne, with top ups offered, dates, Arabic Coffee and hot & cold towels throughout.

I wanted to see the wine list again, but was offered just red or white (two choices), but didn't see the bottle nor was I able to taste first.

The reviews were not overly great, neither is their reputation (most I spoke to had not heard of this airline). The flight times were not great either. The price however was the sticking point and offered the cheapest method of flying to the Philippines for the Christmas period. The Gulf Air fleet is relatively modern. The dreamliner I rode in had plenty of foot-room and the interior was very pleasant to the eye. All my connecting flights were extremely comfortable. My return flight did have a slightly annoying whining noise from the toilet near the entrance to the plane. It sounded more like a technical issue with the bathroom flushing mechanism as it only stopped periodically when people went to the bathroom! The inflight entertainment was extremely responsive, more responsive than any other that I have used before. Regrettably the same cannot be said for the range of content available to watch. I found the offering limited. The staff on the plane were impeccable and worked extremely hard from start to finish. The food can only be described as very average. Certainly better than Etihad's atrocious recent food offering on their long haul product. It does not however meet the same level of standard that befits Qatar Airways or Singapore Airlines. A definite area to improve I think! The worst experience I had was the Bahrain terminal. You are forced to go through security upon arrival for your transit. If you have a tight connection there is no urgency to prioritise those customers, often most people were shoving their way past in the queue to try and meet the connection. Meanwhile the staff were somewhat carefree and very brazenly dismissed the concerns of those passengers. I know from experience it's likely the plane would not leave and be held back slightly, but that reassurance for other passengers was not there. Instead they are forced to queue in what is a seamlessly endless line in an non-air-conditioned room. With only 2 security checkpoints it was woefully inefficient. My return flight to London required a 2nd security check at the actual gate, whereas my first flight to Manila (or any other visible flight) did not, Why? If you are to have security at the gate, be consistent and do it for all gates (Like Changi airport) and at least make the transiting customers have a positive experience. Facilities at the Bahrain terminal are Ok. McDonalds, Costas, enough seating. The building aesthetically is not like any other big airline terminal, but it's okay for what it is.

My return flight to London insisted on a 2nd security check at the gate with a very forceful and intimidating manner against the passengers already present, the whole process was chaotic, to be herded into a separate section. They tore our boarding passes but we had not actually boarded. So we couldn't leave the closed off area to go to the toilet if needed. When we finally started boarding, it was not done in a Zoned manner. Which meant the boarding process took twice as long. It felt a very frustrating experience.

The cabin service was pretty unfriendly and just about functional but we didn't have great expectations of Gulf Air - I know they aren't in the same league as Emirates or Qatar. Upon arrival in Athens we experienced that moment every traveller dreads when the baggage carousel finishes spewing out bags, all the other passengers have gone and you are left holding just your hand luggage. We reported it to the Handling Agent in Athens who told us there was another flight arriving that night but for some reason ours couldn't be located and if it was we wouldn't get it for at least another 48 hours. Deep joy. The started of your holiday with three small children and only the clothes you are wearing and a book and half eaten sandwich for company. We then spent the next three days phoning, emailing and tweeting the airline. All to no avail. No response other than a huge phone bill with hours spent waiting on hold. Eventually our bags were delivered 4 days late to a local island but they were damaged and showing signs of mistreatment. Again - no response, apology or communication or any form from the airline. The return journey back to Riyadh was slightly less miserable and we took the opportunity speak to the airline offices in Athens and Bahrain about compensation. No surprises though when the airline said they couldn't / wouldn't help whatsoever - even complimentary lounge access for our 3 children during the 4 hour layover in Bahrain was flatly refused. In all - it's down to customer service or a total lack of, disregard and disdain for their customers and a haphazard operation. I had a similar experience with Emirates in January and by contrast they couldn't have been more helpful.

Convenient service, very favourable price, on-board customer service always excellent. Total contrast to the ground staff. New Year’s Eve 2017/18. Diverted flight to DXB instead of BAH, then from DXB to BAH and then from BAH to KWI. Worst customer experience I and others who spoke with have ever had. GA turned a minor problem (fog, inevitable delays) into 24 hour nightmare - no doubt longer for some customers less lucky than me. At DXB for about 11 hours. No update issued the entire time. But that experience was mild compared to when we arrived at BAH. Staff totally unresponsive to and contemptuous of their customers, who had serious and legitimate needs, questions. Instead of trying to help, GA staff seemed to take pleasure in making customers’ waiting experience as painful and lengthy as possible. After I lined up for over 6 hours near Gate 13, some staff manning the cues suddenly walked off. Promised to return but never did. One senior GA staff member angrily yelled at the crowd that it was their fault that they were waiting so long because they could not cue in 1 line. He told remaining staff to leave. No reason given. Eventually no one left to serve the customers. Told to go to the transfer area to be served. Went from terrible to much worse. About 15 customer cues, area totally crowded. After 2 hours, some staff again just left, didn’t return. So some cues had no staff. So cues soon turned into an unruly mob pushing and shoving, all pleading to be served. Instead of putting on more staff, GA operated understaffed, but not overworked! All staff at all times were visibly very calm, very relaxed, working very slowly, and also amused to be observing the pleas of the distressed crowd. They thought it was all a joke. There were up to 6 -8 other staff just monitoring the crowds from the front with a contemptuous smile. They could have helped out the lines that had no staff member, but didn’t bother to. Totally ignrored customer requests for assistance. One desperate elderly customer showed me his chest bandages and asked me to hand his passport details to the staff member. He was too weak to fight the pushing crowd. I was by this stage close to being served. I shamefully didn’t help the old man. I was fearful that handing another person’s documents could get me in trouble with the staff & delay the time I would be served. As it happened, as soon as I was given my new boarding pass, I was instructed to go immediately to the gate as they were departing. No baggage ref. number given to me. 5 minutes later and I would have missed that flight & not know when able to get another. It was survival of the fittest at this stage. The above situation was one that the management and ground staff created. They treated their customers like animals. Like a large herd of cattle. People were in distress. Responses to customer requests (if at all) with mindless answers like ‘just wait’ & bored smirk. I thought that the lack of oxygen, water & endless standing could cause me to pass out.

The outward got off to a bad start when we realised at Heathrow check in that our connecting flight In Bahrain for Dubai was impossible to make due to schedule changes - we had a real battle on our hands to get it changed by Gulf Air - they wanted us to sort it in Bahrain. So on leg 1, we had already lost 4 hours of our holiday. The staff were rude, plane was old and very dirty, particularly the toilets, absolutely vile. Bahrain airport is really third world. On our return journey,was even worse! Dubai Check in goes well. We wait in departure, we board and within 15 mins of being on board we are offloaded due to fog in Bahrain. We return to lounges and for the next 8 hours zero communication, terrible customer service in the first class lounge, we discover via the internet  that our flight is leaving at 7.10am. The board was never updated and apparently over 40 passengers were left behind in Dubai. We are told that our connection to London will depart at 10.10am. Arrive in Bahrain, with 90 mins to wait, and now things turn even worse. Our plane just doesn’t materialise. The staff are incredibly rude, arrogant and unhelpful. Passengers are so exhausted and frustrated, the atmosphere becomes militant and staff pull rank by threatening to call the police. In fact we were all diverted to a dead end desk area - which was just a ruse to make us feel something was happening. There was zero communication,a lot of disinterested shoulder shrugging.

"""Have largely positive things to say""",8,2018-01-01,"Have largely positive things to say from London Heathrow - Bahrain - Chennai return trip over Christmas. All flights were roughly on time and very comfortable overall. Seats on both legs were fine and it should be noted that the A321 has an extra inch or so of legroom and better padding over the A330. Service from FAs was fine, with most of them making an effort to fulfil passengers' requests, serving a meal and a small snack on both flights of decent quality- I found myself finishing them all so they must have been ok and the offering was different on all 4 flights so good variety. Selection of drinks was small, basically just offering 2 juices and 2 soft drinks (some of which ran out in flight). Seat back entertainment was only average - the screens themselves were good quality but selections of movies, tv shows and music was small (probably around 10 western films available). Bahrain airport is small though largely clean and easy to navigate, with a small number of dining options and a fair amount of seating (none of which enables you to lie down if you have a long layover) so it was fine overall, as long as you don't mind folk washing their feet in the sink in the toilets, which seemed common! We were fortunate in that both legs between Bahrain and Chennai were far from full so once boarding was complete we managed to grab a whole row of 3 seats each to ourselves, meaning we had plenty of space to lie down in flight, though it's worth noting that none of the armrests on the A321 raise fully so you have to push them up half way and contort your body to fit. My impression of Gulf was that they'll do the job mostly well, though with no frills at all and every so often cracks appearing in the quality e.g. tissue holders coming loose in bathrooms and FAs slow to replace empty loo rolls and most worryingly on 2 flights when passengers stood up as soon as we'd landed but still taxiing and they started opening luggage compartments and moving down the aisle, FAs did practically nothing to stop them! On arrival at Heathrow we taxied for approx 10 mins with 30-40 people standing in the aisles, luggage compartments open, the plane braking heavily several times and the FAs simply asked a couple of people very quietly to sit down, when they didn't, the response was to give up! I would fly with them again if the price were right again, my wife and I paid £440 &, £650 respectively for flights at slightly different times around Christmas and overall this saved us several hundred pounds over other airlines.",True,A330-200 & A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Chennai via Bahrain,December 2017,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",4,5,,True,

The food was excellent – a decent choice and tasty with a reasonable selection of wine and other drinks. The IFE took several attempts to boot but when it did there were no movies – only TV programmes. I wasn’t too bothered because I had a good book and some work. Cabin crew seemed aware of the lack of movies. We arrived 30 minutes early at Bahrain and a coach seamlessly took the business passengers to the terminal. There was no fast track for business transfer passengers and so we had to wait for vast numbers of Indian workers to remove their belts and jewellery. But even then it was considerable more efficient than Heathrow. Gulf Air is clearly not up to Emirates/Etihad/Qatar standards but the standard of service from the friendly and chatty cabin crew and the quality of the food more than makes up for the older aircraft.,True,A330,Business,Business Class,Bangkok to Bahrain,November 2017,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",5,5,,True,

There was an impressive choice and it was neatly served, very tasty and care was taken to ensure that glasses, in my case containing wine, were kept full. The seat was comfortable and the cabin, although very dry, was kept as an ideal temperature for a comfortable sleep. I opted not to receive breakfast but, from what I saw, it was equally satisfying. The cabin crew went out of their way to ensure that we were looked after and there was relatively little that I could find fault with the aircraft or the level of service. There were, perhaps, slightly too many announcements which made watching a film slightly annoying. There was a reasonable selection of films and the IFE worked seamlessly although some passengers seem slightly confused about the innovative control unit.

There was a selection of wines including Petit Chablis: not sure why Gulf Air could not afford to spend a little extra and give of Chablis proper. Cabin crew were excellent – efficient, humorous and attentive. There was a good selection of food and drink and it was served perfectly. It was tasty and well presented. Breakfast consisted of a nice chicken salad and a delicious prawn curry. Cabin announcements were kept to a minimum which is always a relief.

On joining the plane, I was greeted by a friendly crew who were attentive throughout; so happens the steward / chef was Scottish. Food was tasty albeit limited in choice compared to other operators. Likewise the vanity kit was basic. There again, why do you need anything flash? You only have to pay for it!

As initially advised by Gulf, the flight arrived in Bahrain an hour late. Annoyingly, although it is the norm in this part of the world, we were forced onto a bus to the terminal for no obvious reason. After a short spell in the Falcon lounge, which is excellent, eventual arrival in Abu Dhabi was 15 minutes ahead of schedule. In summary, a pleasant flight.

Although we were forewarned by Gulf there'd be problems at Bahrain - a quick check on flight tracking websites suggested at least two A330s had been taken out of service - this did not prepare us for the chaotic scenes on arrival with all long haul flights either cancelled or operating many hours if not days behind schedule. Good point: Gulf Air had done the honourable and organised 5* hotel accommodation and food for the day in Bahrain. Bad point: they neglected to tell us prior to arrival; we only found out by word of mouth after wasting the best part of an hour in various queues. Once we eventually departed the flight was satisfactory; food and service good, legroom tight but no worse than others in cattle class, an excellent inflight system with, alas, nothing much to watch. Do not expect Emirates or QATAR quality if flying Gulf.

I booked my flights on the Gulf Air website, the booking and seat selection process was generally easy however the website would not accept my American Airlines frequent flyer number (I think because it is alpha-numeric). I checked in using the mobile version of the Gulf Air website, this was also easy to use but there were some more minor issues; the AAdvantage number was accepted but the system didn't like my passport number (again this seemed to be because it is alpha-numeric). Fast track security at Heathrow was efficient and the Gulf Air T4 lounge was spacious, had good views of the ramp and a good selection of complimentary food and beverage items. The boarding process was efficient and there was a warm welcome from the Cabin Manager at the boarding door. Prior to departure passengers were offered a welcome drink as well as arabic coffee and dates. The cabin is configured 2x2x2 with seats upholstered in leather. I found the seat comfortable in a seated and reclined position but not so much in the sleeping position due to being sloped. Upon boarding however I noticed a dirty tissue in the side compartment of my seat (presumably missed by the cleaners) and attention to detail with cabin cleanliness seemed to be lacking. The crew were profusely apologetic about this. The onboard service from the Cabin Crew was warm, attentive and friendly and catering was of a high standard. The crew regularly offered drink refills and had a good presence in the cabin. Unfortunately I was served one drink in a dirty glass and again the crew were very apologetic. The transfer to my connecting flight in BAH was easy and the lounge in BAH was of a similar standard to the LHR lounge. Strangely the gate agent for the BAH-AUH sector had to hand write boarding passes for any passengers (including me) who presented mobile boarding passes. This created a delay at the gate and seems to defeat the purpose of a mobile boarding pass if the staff literally have to write one out by hand (something I have never seen before).

This means that at the very start of a long day you start sweating, your clothes become drenched in perspiration and by the end of the day you feel really uncomfortable. They do this so regularly now that it is not an accident. None of the other airlines do it and I'm guessing they think they are being cute and saving money.

After reading some of the reviews on here I was a little concerned however I must say I was very pleased with Gulf Air. We departed late from Heathrow not because of Gulf Air but the usual Heathrow being busy scenario and this meant we would be arrived in Bahrain with a very short connection time of about one hour. The A330 'KC' had been refitted with the new interior which made the cabin smart bright and airy. Seat was comfortable for the six and a half hour journey and I was only just starting to get restless as we arrived. I'm over 6' tall by the way! Cabin crew were very friendly but don't expect much in the way of offerings onboard. We got a drink just after leaving Heathrow then the next offering was two hours later and that was lunch. The food was rather good and I cleared everything! After Lunch the next your get will be just before arrival and that's just orange juice or water. I was starving by the time we arrived in Bahrain but because of the short connection time and arriving late didn't have time to buy anything so next time I would board with supplies. Note that in arrival in Bahrain it will be a bus from the aircraft to the terminal as they park the aircraft up overnight away from the terminal and you'll have to get through another security check too so don't hang about! Bags had been checked through from London so we had everything crossed that they would make it to Muscat too. Flight from BAH-MCT was hassle free the seats actually had more leg room than the flight from London weird! It's only about an hour and a half so comfort not an issue. The aircraft look nearly new so are clean and bright inside and out. You get a cold snack too which was tasty. Crew friendly and both legs and believe it or not our bags arrived too.

Gulf Air customer review,4,2014-10-22,Mediocre at best. I live in the Middle East in Oman. The national carrier Oman Air is consistently ranked among the best and its product is very good when compared to other Middle Eastern airlines. Unfortunately however that ranking seems to have gone to Oman Air's head lately and they have not only increased prices dramatically but are apparently also considering cutting a lot of the services and features that have made them a stand out in a field of also-rans. Because they are above what I can afford for last minute leisure trips I chose to fly Gulf Air to London on the routing MCT-BAH-LHR early this month. The pricing is very competitive and their website originally showed me a wonderful pair of flights that would have only meant a short layover of under two hours in Bahrain. Once the payment screen had been completed however I received ticketing on two flight sets that incorporated a 9.5 hour layover in Bahrain on the way to London and a 7.5 hour layover on the return trip. Amazingly while I was lured in with such a terrific original offer I was now going to be spending nearly one day of my break in Bahrain's mediocre International Airport (and in that facility's mediocre Dilmun Lounge - see separate review). At Muscat we were delayed in boarding and is usual with many Middle Eastern airlines no reason was given for the delay - it just was. Boarding the A320 for Bahrain legroom was quite adequate at 34 inches of pitch I had experienced this on previous short-haul flights with Gulf Air and therefore thought they might be just the ticket to avoid rival Oman Air's new inflationary price structure. After landing at Bahrain International and a lengthy stay in the wildly overpriced Dilmun Lounge I boarded the leg for LHR and was amazed that on an A330 any airline would tighten the seat pith to a measly 31 inches which made for a 7 hour torture ride. Luckily on that leg I had a short row (two seats) to myself and was able to mitigate the pain a little. Sadly Gulf Air has revamped its A330s with new leather seats from Recaro arguably the worst airline seat maker out there. Each of their seats on any aircraft features rough Philips-head screws at precisely where my knees are forced to contact the seat in front of me as I am rather tall and have long legs - sheer torture. If the person in front of me then reclines things are beyond the pale of bearable. Again the flight was delayed and of course there was no explanation of any kind. Gulf Air needs to pull up its socks in terms of food service. While the food was excellent there was precious little of it - only one meal service barely two beverage services and nothing more on an intercontinental price. No comfort packet with eye masks no direly needed ear plugs nothing more. Basically the return trip was the same in reverse although push-back from Heathrow was on the dot. Will I fly Gulf Air again? Probably yes but I'll try to limit it to short haul which is their vastly superior product.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,True,

First leg LHR-BAH was on a refurbished A330. Seats were excellent far more comfortable than they look. Service was good and food was plenty and above standard for business class.

Service and food matched the first leg and was excellent. The old entertainment system was next to useless but a tablet like device was handed out which was well specked with movies and series and the selection was better than the AVOD system in the refurbished cabin.

Old A330-200 and the second cabin in FG had not been refurbished and most of the seats had problems with electric's but they still fully reclined and were comfy and roomy. Old IFE but DVD players offered. Very good food selection together with good wine choice. Service from the FA's was first class pity the aircraft wasn't although the purser advised that it was due for seat upgrade mid 2014. On time arrival a very good flight. An hour in the FG lounge in BAH and then onto our second sector to DXB this time on a new A320 with latest IFE. Although a short flight there was a hot snack and full bar service. On time arrival in DXB together with our luggage from LHR which was a relief. Overall a good flight experience.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,9,2014-01-28,Flew RUH-BAH-LHR on 23 Jan 2014. Both sectors quite full and the flight RUH-BAH was on time and uneventful basic snack for such a short sector seats in economy not overly generous with space but sufficient. I then had a long lay-over in BAH before boarding my flight to LHR which give me time for shopping at the airport! The next sector was comfortable except for a couple of ladies sat behind me kicking the back of my seat as they were trying to move family all over the cabin. in addition I found these same ladies to be quite selfish with the passengers behind them insisting on reclining their seats while the meal service was on. I was pleased thought to see the GF Cabin Crew to take control of both situations in a pleasant but firm way and eventually the ladies calmed down. The flight itself was pleasant and fro an economy product the food both super and breakfast and entertainment was excellent. The crew made me feel comfortable and the offer of refreshments were plenty. I even managed to get a few hours’ sleep on the flight which left me refreshed when I arrived at LHR. One minor irritation was when we arrived we had to wait over 40 minutes for our baggage to be delivered to the belt. I cannot wait to experience the return flight but before that I have family to catch up with!,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,2,2014-01-24,I'm usually a fan of Gulf Air but my latest experience with them was simply horrible. Cairo to Doha via Bahrain. Flight from Cairo to Bahrain was on A321 full flight with not one free seat. Food as usual was great (in my opinion Gulf Air's food is far superior to the food of Qatar or Emirates). However the nightmare began during transit in Bahrain. The flight to Doha was delayed 2 hours. Not one announcement was made on the reason of the delay. Airport staff in Bahrain were both rude and clueless. On the flight itself to Doha the Bahraini male flight attendants were rude and sarcastic when asked about the delay. Only water was offered to the passengers comparable to low cost airlines which Gulf Air is supposedly not. This airline is going downhill fairly quickly. Also their IFE needs an Einstein to figure it and the entertainment is very old and limited.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,False,

Gulf Air customer review,5,2013-12-21,BAH-MNL and still the IFE is very poor and when will it be on demand with up to date films? Lucky that we had a DVD type player as that was a godsend to have as at least it had up to date movies but battery life was not too good for a long flight. Food pretty good this time around as it seems to depend on the on-board chef as they do differ on the flights I have been on previously. Again one of the toilets was out of order which is pretty poor when this flight was completely full!

Though my ticket RUH-BAH was economy the crew looked after me very well. On arrival at the GF Lounge in BAH my seat was immediately changed to 1G. Likewise on check-in for the LHR-BAH on 2 Oct my allocated seat was 2A. These front 'lie flat' seats are the old GF 1st Class product.

Gulf Air customer review,8,2013-10-22,From MCT to BOM then back BOM-MCT. I must say that the entertainment wasn't good at all. The food from MCT-BAH was not very special it was a small sandwich which I think is very good for a 1 hr 20 min flight (in Europe you wont get a meal but drinks only if lucky). The connection times were very bad we arrived in Manama at around 0 am and had to catch the next flight at 10 am and we would have to sleep on the floor. The Crew were very nice nothing to complain about. The flight to Bombay was really nice the meal was a nice Chicken tikka but we could choose from vegetarian to beef to chicken.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,6,2013-10-15,Flew BAH-MNL and still the IFE is not on demand but at least you get a DVD type player with selected movies. But does not compare to the likes of Qatar Emirates. Food seems to be below average or maybe down to the caterer at this destination as I did not eat must of mine. Crew were very pleasant and very helpful.

Friendly flight attendants in nice attire - 2 male and 2 female. In-flight Entertainment was great - more choices on this A320 for Gulf flights than on United for 12 hour international flights.

Gulf Air customer review,5,2013-09-12,This report will be published as it is before I take my trip with GF (I will follow up with a review post trip). GF changed from a 3 class airline to a 2 class airline some four years or so. I am flying RUH-BAH-LHR-BAH-RUH on 24 Sept and 2 Oct. I have used miles to upgrade and after reviewing the config of the A332 have just called the call centre to request a seat on row 1 or 2 on the BAH-LHR-BAH sectors as these are 'lie flat'. I was told I could not as these are reserved for 'J' Class passengers only; hence still a 3 class airline! The scores shown are pre flight and my feelings/dealings with the GF staff thus far.,False,,,Business Class,,,,4,,,,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,9,2013-09-02,LHR-BAH-BKK return. All flights on time. Quick and hassle free boarding at all airports. Online Check-In worked well (something that Etihad can't seem to manage). A330 aircraft on all sectors. Older aircraft but more spacious and comfortable seats than the flights operated by Emirates Etihad or Qatar. Food was fine and plenty drinks choices with regular juice and water service. Excellent Cabin Crew. Only downside was the poor IFE compared to the competition so take a ipod and a book. Very nice service through Bahrain which is in my opinion a much better transit airport than Dubai Abu Dhabi or Doha.

Gulf Air customer review,5,2013-08-08,COK-BAH-LHR. Food was ok and what we did not like and had a major issue with was that my 2 year old daughter was hungry during the Bahrain to London flight and the flight crew informed us that they had run out of milk.

Gulf Air customer review,10,2013-07-15,Dubai to London Heathrow return via Bahrain in both directions. Airbus A320 on the DXB-BAH sectors and larger Airbus A330 on the Bahrain London segments. Faultless service from Gulf Air from the point of checking in at Dubai to arriving back in Dubai 10 days later. The cabin crew really do make this airline special. What it lacks in new aircraft super IFE and gadgets and gizmos is more than compensated for by the crew who give excellent customer service. All cabins lightly loaded in all sectors. I managed to get row 8 on the two longer flights and had no one sitting next to me. Therefore masses of leg and elbow room. Onboard chef a nice touch. Could not fault the catering. If I had to grumble about anything it's possibly the slow service on the Bahrain to London sector where the same crew start serving at Row 1. So it took a while to reach Row 8. Not to worry: a flight attendant kept my glass of Laurent Perrier champagne filled up throughout and replenished the bowl of hot nuts several times without the need to be prompted. Lounges at Bahrain and London superb the latter offering an amazing view out of Terminal 4 across the entire Heathrow campus. Staff were polite and efficient. All in all flying on Gulf Air reminded me of visiting an old Auntie who was determined to make sure that I was fed and watered until I was about to burst! In fact it was nice to be treated nice and to escape from the technology that features so much on other airlines these days.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,True,

Unfortunately I had the ""pleasure"" to be re-routed by Etihad on this airline as their BKK departure was late and there was no more connection to AMM on the same day. Alas from Etihad to Gulf Air is quite a downgrade. BKK-BAH on an ageing A330. I had to change seats 4 times until I finally found one that was not broken and/or had a seat belt. Luckily the plane was quite empty so I could move around until I finally found a seat in 'working condition'. The IFE was poor limited selections of movie all of them quite out of date.

A330 from LHR-BAH in need of refurbishment the IFE is incredibly poor and the seats feel like ironing boards! The A320s used on the BAH-DOH route are in contrast brand new comfortable and have modern IFE. The food is fine but I found some of the crew to be surly and unfriendly.

I asked for a blanket again no response. Food quality was average and the menu was very limited. It was a 3.5 hrs flight STD 21.35 hr and the crew took more than 1.5 hrs to start serving dinner i.e. they served dinner at 23.00 hrs which is past dinner time. By this time passengers had started asking for dinner which again the crew failed to serve promptly. Cabin crew were lax and casual in their attitude and at times discourteous.

Gulf Air customer review,,2013-02-05,The actual flights were satisfactory with good food and service although I agree with other comments about the rather shabby seats and average IFE. However our booking experience was horrendous. In October we booked a flight to Sri Lanka for 3 weeks returning on an evening flight (7pm) from Colombo on 22 Dec. On 3 Dec our agent advised us of a change to our return flight which would involve us arriving in Bahrain at 07.40 on 23 Jan and leaving there on 24 Jan at 02.00 - no offer of hotel. After protest this was changed to another flight leaving Colombo at 04.45 on 22 Jan. This meant we would lose a day of our holiday. After another protest this was changed (on 6 Dec) to the same time but on 24 Jan now 2 days more than planned. Finally on 3 Jan we received yet another email changing our return flight offering us to either return on 22 (as previously suggested) in the early morning flight or on 25 on the same flight. We now had a choice of losing 2 days or gaining 2 days and had no time to reply as taxi was waiting (and hotels etc were already booked). We had to sort this out at Heathrow where they were very helpful and we finally agreed to return on 25 Jan 3 days later than the original plan. All these changes were attributed to cancellations by Gulf Air. We frequently tried to contact them by phone but without success. We thought at first it was an excuse from our agent but have since discovered that Gulf Air had cancelled several flights the previous month. I shall certainly never fly with them again. I would rather pay extra for a reliable company.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,9,2013-01-30,Flew on DXB-BAH-BKK sector and return. It was my first time with GF and the food was superb.

The flight attendants were friendly and helpful the seats comfortable for these 2 short flights and the meals were quite tasty too. The leg from BAH-MCT was in a fairly old plane and the seats were showing signs of wear. The lounge in Bahrain airport was comfortable and spacious though they don't give announcements for flights so you just have to make your way down to the gate at about the right time (which for us was always too early). The IFE system is the only major drawback but we only had short flights so it wasn't a major issue.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,7,2013-01-18,LHR-Bahrain-Muscat return. All flights left and arrived on time. A multicultural crew gave friendly service in both directions and meals were quite decent for economy class. Seat backs and headrests on A330 however were hard and uncomfortable without a pillow and something I found unacceptable was that 2 of 4 toilets in the economy class cabin were out of service in both directions. On LHR-Bahrain sector a drinks service was offered right after take-off and nothing until we were over Turkey by which time the one and only meal was served. Flight attendants came around occasionally with trays of juice or water. Inflight entertainment is on a loop system which some will find antiquated but I actually didn't mind as it allows you to watch several things at a time. Bahrain-Muscat was on a very comfortable Embraer aircraft with light meal service and a more limited in-seat entertainment system.

Food sub standard although they serve 3 choices - usually out by the time they reach the back area. Service is slow. Cabin crew not smiling and are always in a hurry they disappeared after the meals were served. Only one round of drinks given. Garbage on the floor and crew did not bother to pick them up.

Gulf Air customer review,7,2012-12-25,BAH-MNL. Lucky to find that Business class had these flat bed seats installed so had a good rest on the flight.

Gulf Air customer review,7,2012-12-14,KUW-BHR-LHR return. Went Gulf Air as they were offering some very competitive Business Class fares. The Kuwait to Bahrain short haul was great the new seats were in place and were suitably luxurious and the food excellent for a 45 minute flight. Bahrain to LHR was satisfactory but the cabin has not yet been refurbished so it was pretty old school and the IFE was moderate (hand held). Nevertheless it was a comfortable flight with excellent food good lounges and all arrivals were on time. I'd go again given the keen pricing but on the London route it still lags behind in terms of overall experience due to the old cabin.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,True,

The food was good especially with the re introduction of offering 3 options. I was disappointed with the IFE as I thought Skyhub was available on GF flights only to find out it is yet to be rolled out. Overall I thought the flight was good.

Onboard A330 seating was ok but short of offerings by their Gulf based competitors. A good menu available well presented and tasty with a good selection of wines and other beverages. Rather than the installed IFE C class passengers were given standalone equipment which had a fair range of viewing options. Transit in Bahrain was fine lounge had a great view over the apron and friendly staff but furnishings very tired and early morning food offerings not the best. Connecting flight on A320 C class had 2-2 configuration. Meal served was fair alcoholic drinks only available on request. Return was a sharp contrast - flight cancelled and no help at airport. Finally booked to fly 4 days late. Check-in the usual chaos with no dedicated C class line. Once through the plane did not appear for several hours. Information very poor left in the lounge for several hours. Finally the plane landed departure delayed until the next morning. Baggage not returned and people left to fend for themselves. Eventually we flew with no proper meal. Red eye flight to London on A340 offered the best seat/cabin served light evening snacks which were tasty and an average breakfast.

On request crew provided a toothbrush and paste. Other than that the 3.5 hour flight was enjoyable and landed early at COK. Will fly again with Gulf Air.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,True,

Gulf Air customer review,4,2012-05-17,LHR-BAH BAH-MNL return. LHR-BAH: Late to check-in online so was stuck in the middle 4 seats. My tray table kept falling down the locking mechanism had broken and was held up by duct tape. BAH-MNL: Aircraft was newer with better seats entertainment and food. I was pleased with the overall flight. MNL-BAH: an average flight. The food was okay but not to everyone's liking. On the bright side I was able to get three 15 minute Wi-Fi cards for the aircraft's wireless Internet connection. After waiting 8 hours at BAH we boarded BAH-LHR flight on an older A330-200. It didn't include Wi-Fi nor did it include live television. Food wasn't too impressive although the flight attendants were able to 'silence' crying babies with ease. It's a bit hit-and- miss with Gulf Air. I would have given the airline a higher rating if they supply Europe with their newer fleet of A330-200s.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,2,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,8,2012-04-30,MAA-BAH-FRA. All flights on time. Economy class but was upgraded to business class from MAA-BAH. Business class meal service was excellent. On both sectors brand new aircraft. BAH-FRA service was operated by PrivatAir on B737-700. Had ample legroom due to exit row. Free flow of snacks and drinks throughout. Breakfast adequate and filling. AVOD on both sectors but compared to competitors entertainment options quite limited.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,8,2012-04-26,London Heathrow-Bangkok via Bahrain return. All 4 flights were very good. Helpful cabin crew. Planes outbound were old and the entertainment slightly lacking. Return flights were newer planes and the entertainment fantastic. Meals pretty standard nothing to rave about. Would definitely fly Gulf Air again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,9,2012-04-25,Flew from Copenhagen to Mumbai - a very pleasant experience. Aircraft was modern and clean with good leg room. Food was nice and staff very helpful. We had the same experience on our return except that we then were given seats in business class from Mumbai to Bahrain. Next time I will not hesitate using Gulf Air.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,5,2012-04-12,Overall mixed trip London Heathrow-Abu Dhabi via Bahrain. First flight on ageing A330 A bit shabby but otherwise clean. Food tasteless and I could not eat all of it it was a night flight so I slept most of the way and the entertainment was nothing to shout about. Connection to Abu Dhabi was ok but Gulf Air changed the plane to an ageing A319. The snack offered was horrible. Return connection to Bahrain a completely different story. Very new and clean Embraer E-190. Inflight entertainment was brilliant with plenty of choice. Breakfast was very tasty. Return flight was much the same with the food not very nice and the entertainment not great. I think I will be sticking to British Airways next time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,8,2012-03-14,London-Bahrain Bahrain-Manila return to London.

All in all a good experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,6,2012-01-27,BEY-BAH-MAA. A pleasant surprise overall A320 in excellent condition on both legs. Catering between average (per ME standards) and mediocre in quality crew definitely not motivated some very stressed. Both flights departed and arrived on time. The service is not a bliss but being cheaper than lowcost's on this leg makes them definitely value for money and under those conditions I would fly them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,2,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,7,2012-01-24,LHR-BAH in Falcon Gold. Old A340-600. Boarded on time but error in Pax numbers resulted in 30 minute delay and much frustration for many with tight connections. Aircraft showing its age with worn seating and no AVOD but cabin service was excellent with Chef providing really good food accompanied by a decent wine list. Whilst the A340 is an old bird it still gives a smooth a quiet flight but the sooner Gulf update their Falcon Gold cabins the better.,False,,,First Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,3,2012-01-19,Economy: LHR-BKK return. Very hard to give a balanced review as each flight in the four parts was like flying different airlines. The service levels varied so much. Food very good on all legs. Transfer in Bahrain 10/10 great little airport and no buses. Flight attendants: from the gum chewing lady who loudly told her co-worker she didn't like speaking German to the girls that though it funny that they where too busy to get into position and could only point to one exit door during the safety video. Contrast this to the crew on the last leg home who without doubt could have been from any of the top performing airlines in the world. Would I fly Gulf again? At their low prices hard not to Just don't expect to much and then if your lucky your expectations might just be exceeded if your lucky! Entertainment can't review as broken on all legs - says it all really.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,7,2012-01-17,DOH-LHR via Bahrain. Outbound flight was delayed 2 hours coming from JED. As usual cabin crew very active and helpful haven't seen the Sky Hub onboard yet on both ways. Presentation of meals was very good Gulf Air Lounge in LHR is nice with an average amount of food and drinks. GF needs to reschedule the connection flights times to DOH since they are rescheduling their flight times to Europe.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,7,2012-01-09,FRA to KUL via BAH. Outbound flight was very good and left on time. Seats were spacious food was good and staff friendly and present in the cabin a lot. Bahrain to Kuala Lumpur flight was delayed but again the flight was good and staff great. The only downside was the 6 hour stop over in Bahrain and the inflight entertainment was pretty basic but worked and had a choice of a few movies. Definitely value for money.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,8,2011-12-23,LHR-KTM via BAH. Good flight on all legs. Good food. Cabin staff efficient and professional. Unlimited drinks on request.

Gulf Air customer review,10,2011-12-18,FRA-BAH-MNL return. Flight from FRA to BAH was on time. Friendly staff good IFE food ok and enough room to sit. Only one hour stop in BAH. Flight to MNL excellent as well. Very good value for the money. I will fly Gulf Air again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True,

Gulf Air customer review,10,2011-12-05,KUL-BAH-CDG return on the 330 for all segments. Excellent value for money! FA's professional friendly and hospitable. The food was appetizing with a wide variety of options. What remains for Gulf Air is simply to replace their aircraft's with new ones and their rating will definitely improve.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,7,2011-11-28,IFE was a relatively short loop of programs on 10+ channels with moving map forward and ground cam view. The channels repeated themselves 3 times during a 7 hr flight and were the same in both directions. During the last 45 mins before landing the IFE shows adverts over and over again. This gets quite frustrating when you are on a few Gulf flights - one after the other. Food and service was very good with warm bread and tasty food (not served in a foil tray).,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,3,2011-11-22,London to Sri Lanka via Bahrain return. Very poor service inflight entertainment even worse and mine didn't work at all on all legs of trip. Food disappointing and lack of drinks served be they alcoholic or non-alcoholic. Plus side flights went out on time and arrived on time. Shabby aircraft on the interior. General all round disappointment and will not travel on them again unless there is no other option.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,2,2011-11-21,Doha-Bahrain-Bangkok return. Was shocked what poor condition the aircraft was in. Outbound my partners seat wouldn't stay upright so kept reclining back the whole trip. The TV monitors weren't working in our whole section. On the BKK to Doha return again the plane was in poor condition and while the TV monitors kind of worked the speakers didn't so once again we were staring at the seat for 7 hours. I saved money flying them but next time I would rather spend more money and fly a better airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,4,2011-11-10,LHR-BAH-KUL Lounge at LHR very nice good food and service. Not so good once I got onboard. In the back bit of Business which is more Premium Economy than business. First seat didn't work so I moved (only 4 in cabin) and the second seat stopped working. AVOD very poor quality and choice. On check-in I'd been warned that refurb work at BAH meant they were using a temporary lounge. They were using the quite basic Cathay lounge instead which was crowded and poor. For the leg to KUL I was bumped up to the front row decent seat and more attentive service. Handed out personal media players but still a limited choice. Food good on both legs but drinks service a bit slow and forgetful.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,,2011-09-18,Got bumped at Bahrain during a TRV-ABQ itinerary had to stay overnight which meant I missed the connection in NYC to ABQ. They put me up in Bahrain but no compensation at all was given for one whole day of delay. Also extremely rude and unprofessional personnel. They are probably made that way by dealing with lots of unsatisfied customers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,8,2011-09-14,Milano Malpensa to Bahrain in Economy and Business on the return to Italy. Both cabins very clean crew extremely professional good seats in Economy - I could easily sleep. Old but comfortable seats in Business. Good quality of food in both cabins and entertainment with several movies (in Italian too) music and video games. I would fly again.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,,2011-09-10,After having bought a Milan-Bangkok return Economy class for myself and my partner once at the Malpensa airport I decided to buy a Business Class upgrade. Business Class was made of old fashion seats just a bit larger with a pathetic foot rest that did not even fully extend. We chose to fly Economy on the return due to upgrade problems. The plane from Bangkok to Bahrain seemed to be old with poor maintenance seats rows close and the seats have a poor reclining angle. Bahrain to Milan was even worse - it had only 2 toilets for the entire Economy Class they played percussion music during the entire night flight and every now and then the entire light system would go into a strobe effect that lasted several minutes.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,7,2011-08-25,CAI-BAH-MCT checked-in 24 hrs before my flight. First leg onboard A330 spacious comfortable and clean. Upgraded to Business Class meant an enjoyable first leg with attentive crew. Flight to Muscat on a pretty new Embraer E190 tight seats are comfortable food is ok during takeoff the AC kept dropping water on me. Worth the price.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,2,2011-08-22,Frankfurt to Bahrain Bahrain to Kathmandu return. Economy class inflight entertainment system was limited and old fashioned. Blurry monitor and old remote with limited options. Food quality was awful limited wines and soft drinks during 7 hr flight. Chicken meal and pasta when I asked for chicken they said pasta was only my option.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,9,2011-08-17,CPH-BAH-BKK. The airline is new to Copenhagen; thus they have been selling promotional tickets. First leg was an A321 operated by Privatair but dressed in Gulf Air colours. Aircraft only 25% full. Service was excellent: 3 meal options (in fact reduced to two due to low loading of passengers). Free and constant flow of drinks if asked for one was mostly offered two. Wines of lower quality only tolerable. Very good service excellent IFE lots of movies. BAH-BKK: A330. Noisy plane 75% full but still nice caring service. Good food 3 options again. I rejected the red wine and the FA brought me a glass of a much better wine from the Business Class section. In the morning they let me sleep instead of giving me breakfast which I was pleased with.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,8,2011-08-14,LHR-BAH-KTM. Nice trip with no delays. Food was ok from LHR-BAH with some western style dishes. To KTM food was more Asian which was nice with plenty of drinks rounds. When asked for more legroom I got an upgrade to Business class. BAH aircraft was A330 which looked nice and new. To KTM we flew an A340 which was tired and worn out.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,8,2011-07-26,KBL-BAH-CDG-BOS (code share w/AA) and BOS (code share w/AA) LHR-BAH-KBL. In short GF offers and delivers excellent value for money. On the flight from Kabul to BAH the Arabic lamb stew and tabuleh salad were nothing short of excellent and the full open bar service is generous as nearly unlimited rounds are offered. Transiting BAH is very easy and GF's arrangement with Aeroports de Paris is such that it is assigned gates at CDG that are immediately adjacent to its code-share partner AA so that transit experience is seamless as well. At LHR a change of terminal is required but ground personnel are very helpful. All in all a very good travel experience with Gulf Air.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,7,2011-07-24,LHR-BAH BAH-CMB. First leg on A330 not bad service. Crew worked hard and were very polite. Did not have food so cannot comment on taste. Lady sitting next to me had about 3 pieces of baggage with her. And she held onto it during the course of the flight. Entertainment not the latest. 2nd leg on A320 again very hardworking crew. I found crew were pleasant and ready to help. Food was poor and bland on this sector. Plenty of juice rounds which was nice but entertainment was old. All flights on time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,6,2011-06-23,DOH-BAH-MXP return in May excellent cabin crew quality of food was also good (quantity is not) portable entertainment system which worked fine but without to many options both legs departures and arrivals were on time. Falcon Gold Lounge in Bahrain was a little bed cramped but fine for 2 hours connection flight.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,7,2011-06-16,"Paris-Kuala Lumpur Economy class. One-way fare was the cheapest among airlines for last minute booking as cheap as AirAsiaX. Flight on time check in at CDG quick. Transit at the Bahrain hassle free. Seat quite comfortable passengers were provided with eye mask and socks. Inflight entertainment was OK around 20 video channels on 6.5"" LCD screen. Inflight meals was average. Cabin crew quite attentive and friendly.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,5,2011-06-08,DXB-BAH-LHR. Onboard service adequate between BAH-LHR. IFE A330 outdated and frequently freezing. Been flying regularly with Gulf Air since early nineties. The service has certainly dipped in standards since then. They have a lot of room for improvement if they are to compete with the other carriers of the Gulf. Certainly rank as a 3 star carrier. LHR-BAH-DXB once again service pretty much average no IFE working on whole A330 flight to BAH. Staff were helpful and polite aircraft looking very tired and dilapidated.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,6,2011-06-04,London to Colombo via Bahrain. The staff were friendly food nothing special beverage selection was good. There was a problem with my seat on the first journey from London to Bahrain and I could not recline which was an annoyance. The entertainment system was not very good - a very old system. On the second journey however I got a free upgrade to Business class the service was very good. They really to cater to every need that you have in business class. The aircraft on first journey was an A330 and a nice aircraft Bahrain to Colombo an A320 very small.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,,2011-05-11,Was supposed to be flying with Gulf Air from Isfahan to London via Bahrain. Gulf cancelled the flight and refused to make alternative arrangements. I won't be flying with them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,9,2011-05-05,ATH-BAH-KUL E190 was new and pleasant with great IFE. A330 was ok with no complaints. Service was good and the food tasty. In the A330 flight the service was adequate even though there was a long time that the staff was disappeared (after lunch till breakfast). I noticed that people were going to the back galley and returning with sandwiches and refreshment. We had a 10 hour stopover in BAH and provided hotel food visa support.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,,2011-04-26,CMB-BAH. Arrived in CMB from Heathrow and stayed 7 days on a family holiday planned to fly to BAH on the early flight to be told that my family and myself had our tickets cancelled by Gulf Air - panic began to arrive as on further investigation Gulf had no record of myself and 3 extra passengers travelling. Felt totally abandoned following a visit to Colombo office for the second time - 3 hrs journey each way and a 2 hour wait in the offices. Having to prove that we are Gulf passengers by showing baggage tags and e-tickets - being the annual family holiday left us all drained and very upset.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,4,2011-04-09,BAH-JED This service is operated by A330-200 in short / medium haul configuration of Business and Economy with old-style arm-chair type seating in Business. The aircraft interior and seating had a tired look and feel about it - the panelling of the seats would appear to have been recently repainted by hand – and badly. IFE is AVOD but with limited choice of viewing. GF makes a big thing of having a chef onboard but in reality the food is standard medium haul Business fare that is reasonably presented but questionable quality. I had lamb steak which was inedible – a sharp knife was not able to cut through the steak. The cabin crew was multi-national as is normal in the Middle East – efficient and professional if not full of the joys of life. This was a 09h40 departure out of BAH supposedly but initially delayed to 10h45 due to the usual ”late arrival of the inbound aircraft”. At 10h45 when on-board we were advised that we would be further delayed until 11h15 whilst we awaited some connecting passengers who had been delayed due to their ”late arrival of the inbound aircraft”. Then we were told that a passenger had fallen ill and that we had to await the arrival of a doctor who eventually pitched up and treated the passenger on-board. That whole process took almost another hour – he was very lucky as most other airlines would have booted the passenger off. We eventually got away at 12h15 2h 35m late. GF used to be the dominant airline in the Gulf but is now up against some stiff local competition and trailing by a good margin.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,8,2011-03-15,DAM-BAH-KUL. Departure from Damascus on E170 - first time for me on Embraer aircraft and was surprised at the leg room and comfort for Y class. They upgraded me to J Class on the short flight. Arrived Bahrain and given a complimentary stay at the Golden Tulip. Just after midnight transferred back to the airport for 2am flight to Kuala Lumpur. The flight ended up to be 95% full and it was extremely painful to sit on the hard Y seats of their A330-200. Service and meal great. I just wonder why the 2nd meal service for all flight ex-Bahrain is much more appetizing as compared to those flight bound for Bahrain?,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,2,2011-03-07,DXB-BAH-LHR return I bought this flight due to the fairly low price. The flight was awful on the way out really dated aircraft horrible food and I forgot about the old IFE system - felt like I was back in the 1990's! The return flight was okay not so different although this time we had a choice of meals and it was a bit more welcoming also frequent offers of drinks after meal. The cabin crew were good no complaints about them but what a shame for Gulf Air.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,5,2011-03-04,Kuwait to New Delhi via Bahrain small plane A320 used a bit claustrophobic. Only two crew members completely inadequate. Food was just passable and can be improved. The meal service took more than one hour - some passengers had meal some had to wait to for more than 1 hour. Alcohol was not served for reasons unknown. No inflight entertainment.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,2,2011-02-26,Gulf Air was rather an unpleasant experience. When we arrived at the gate on Heathrow in transit from Amsterdam to Kathmandu Nepal we were checked in but our luggage was not. This we found out in Kathmandu. Four pieces of luggage - not transported. Because of this bad service we almost missed our expedition to Tibet two days later. Of course we are not happy. We wrote complaint to Gulf Air but we don't get any answer on that. It seems that Gulf Air is not interested. Kathmandu to Bahrein was not pleasant customers were about 98 percent Nepalese and crew was not polite or helpful. The food was terrible also on the flight from Bahrein to London - curry beans with bean salad is not a good meal early morning. Gulf Air - never again!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,5,2011-02-26,I recently travelled with Gulf Air to/from Sri Lanka. I had read some pretty poor reviews prior to flying and some of them turned out to be true. On two of the flights toilets were blocked or locked. Beware of row 28 on the A320-100/200 these seats do not recline. Although we were at the front of the check-in queue we were allocated these seats.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,9,2011-02-25,KUL-BAH-DAM with overnight in Bahrain. Flight to Bahrain on A332 which was 70% full so I ended up with 4 seats all to myself. After arrival at 2pm collected my rental car and proceeded to the Golden Tulip for the night. After check in we were advised against going out due to the tense situation. So decided to stay in and watched TV. Next morning drove to the airport and everything was okay. Cabin crew excellent. Meals outstanding though portions were small.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,8,2011-02-14,FRA-BAH-IFN. FRA-BAH on new A330 BAH-IFN on Embraer 170. Both flights pleasant despite being almost 100% full. I found crew hard-working and friendly (on FRA flights they offered beverages at least 4 times and trays and cups collected regularly). The food on the first flight was excellent and seats were comfortable. Only negative points : the plane was very cold when we boarded it and that didn't improve much during the flight (fortunately they handed out blankets generously) and the IFE system for my seat was not working properly. BAH is a small and convenient airport.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,5,2011-02-01,Muscat to Colombo via Bahrain economy class. Muscat to Bahrain flight was ok. Bahrain to Colombo flight was very poor quality in cabin staff service. They served the dinner after dinner the cabin crew were very reluctant to collect empty trays. I saw most of the passengers sitting uncomfortably they were unable to move or go to even for toilets.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,5,2011-02-01,BKK-BAH-LHR. I bought this flight from Bangkok International airport the day before departure I needed to get home fairly quickly so settled for this airline which was a bit of a mistake. The flight was a little late leaving but its rare to depart exactly on time. The plane was old and dirty and seats not very comfortable. I am a very tall guy so I must have extra leg room which they were more than happy to arrange - but there were plenty of spare seats so if your on the ball you can grab a whole row and lay across I was not so lucky the seats were quite narrow too. The food was terrible I couldn't eat half of it as its catered for middle-eastern people. Their prices are good and it shows - if you don't care about food and cleanliness then its fine but I wouldn't fly with them again if I had the choice. The staff were friendly but you rarely see them only to give you food and you don't get any free drinks only with a meal. Bahrain airport is nice and clean with shops and restaurants if you want to eat there (McDonalds etc). Overall a budget international airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,5,2011-01-17,DOH-BAH-CDG return in business class. We got the flat bed seats because we paid the J class fare IFE was old and terrible the food was not good on outbound but much better on the return flight. Seat was okay at best though the width was nice.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,4,2011-01-15,Islamabad to Cairo Via Bahrain. Flight from Islamabad to Bahrain was full food was insipid. Crew seen only during food serving. Bahrain to Cairo flight was little better service wise and food wise. Same thing on the way back on Dec 31st. this is a below average airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,,2011-01-03,Does anyone know what's going on with Gulf Air pricing as of late? I complained a few months back that they were raising their prices for Bahrain-Bangkok in Falcon Gold (Business/First) and the response being the smart business people they are in Gulf Air was to raise them up even more! Previously was around 6-700 Dinars return Bahrain-Bangkok. Now it is running 650 Dinars one way! More than 1400 Dinars return. I checked Bahrain to London and it is running 750 Dinars - one way. I thought it might be due to upgrading costs for the Falcon Gold cabin but they are pricing themselves out of the game and still using the same tired A340s maybe spruced up a bit but I don't know as I'm now avoiding Gulf and their price gouging like the plague. Qatar Airways Business class is still reasonable around 6-700 Dinars return if you don't mind the short turn around in Doha between Bahrain and Bangkok. My mate did it last week and said it was good. Anyone have any idea what Gulf Air's twisted business plan is?,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,3,2011-01-03,KUL-BAH-CAI trip outward pretty good A340. Food okay but not the best. Service good. GF need to maintain their seats the entertainment system was broken. Trip back was horrible and disappointing. A340 CAI-BAH delayed 4-5 hours BAH-KUL was seated in middle air conditioning wasn't adequate and hottest plane ever flew! There were not enough blankets for all passengers so they had to increase the heat! Saw one passenger asking for blanket and was turned down nut they were later found in an overhead compartment! Food good with turkey served xmas day. But what's the point when I was boiled up to the point I couldn't even go to sleep and had to walk to the galley to get some air?,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,5,2010-12-30,LHR-BAH 26 December. Skyteam lounge in Terminal 4 is good a little tatty perhaps but the buffet was decent. Self-serve champagne and a decent selection of very cold wines. Flight was pretty ordinary. IFE is poor - half a dozen films on a loop with rubbish image quality so they have started handing out personal media players which are preloaded with a dozen movies and music etc. The standard of service was very good - real care and attention to detail. Food excellent - turkey for Christmas champagne served throughout. Planes are pretty tatty and the prices no better than Emirates or Qatar Airways so even though staff get top marks and the food was good I would never recommend Gulf Air over these two airlines.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,9,2010-12-22,BEY-BAH-KUL: BEY-BAH dinner was excellent. BAH-KUL FAs did excellent job. Dinner was wonderful and the 2nd meal prior to arrival is far superior to the grilled vegetarian sandwich they served on the way to Bahrain!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,9,2010-12-15,KUL-BAH-BEY. Things better now that GF has introduced their A332 instead of their ancient A340. Seat pitch is a little bit more generous. The 2nd meal before arrival into BAH was simply disgusting - it seems that nobody wanted their sandwich! The meal to BEY was great. Despite Gulf Air's inconsistent quality I find crew professional and dedicated. Their fares are also an attraction for me.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,,2010-12-11,I am a gold card carrying frequent flyer Falcon class. Gulf have clearly decided to dump any premium allegiances by treating business travellers very badly. LHR-DXB no record of (online confirmed) booking bumped from allocated seat on overnight flight to seat with no pitch. BAH- LHR technical problem resulted in a substituted plane which was something out of the 1970's - no apologies terrible seat pitch. Made a formal complaint 2 months ago - heard nothing - Gulf Air have the Ryanair approach to customer service.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,8,2010-11-10,Kuwait to Bahrain on new A320 . No PTVs but seat and legroom better than average and with a friendly crew made such a short flight a very pleasant experience. The snack box on this sector is adequate. I would fly GF again if it's on their newer equipment considering that Bahrain airport is a fairly easy airport to transit through.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,4,2010-11-10,KUL-BAH-LHR and back - flights not as bad as I expected it to be. Flight from KUL on an ancient A340 which featured peep holes between two toilets at the back of the aircraft (ex- SQ). Flight was packed and seats carpets and other parts of the overhead cabin were falling apart. BAH to LHR was on a similar aircraft but a shade better. Crew generally pleasant and made up for the shabby aircraft. Transit in BAH is tedious with the security checks even upon arrival before proceeding to transfer desk with no consideration to short transits. Return on LHR to BAH was stated A332 but my worst enemy appeared the A340 - same aircraft then took me to KUL eventually. Crew again very pleasant and friendly food alright but Gulf Air needs to really buck up on their aircraft renewal refurbishing or upgrading at least. They have so much to offer otherwise.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,8,2010-10-25,Larnaca-Dubai via Bahrain Business class. Gulf Air offers cheap rates compared to with Emirates. The day of departure they suffered a London Heathrow T5 problem with their computer system so my flight was delayed and I had to wait 6 hours in Bahrain for a connecting flight to Dubai. Gulf Air was very good in communicating the delays via SMS. All flights are old style business class but much better than European short or medium haul business class. Service and food was excellent Larnaca to Bahrain average on other flights. Good wine selection. Business Lounge in Bahrain is excellent but I pity the economy passengers who must transit in such poor airport. No security fast track at Bahrain but the security staff is very prompt in screening passenger (not sure that they are very thorough in their safety check though).,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,2,2010-10-12,Paris CDG to Bahrein and back in Economy. On the flight to BAH (daytime) I found that the hot meal was not good (tasteless) and IFE is really outdated with a very limited choice and no information regarding the hours when the film begins. Not confortable but what you expect from Economy. On the way back (at a terrible time 1.30 am) the weaknesses of the old planes are even more obvious. The economy seat seems to have no more foam left on the back mine could not recline the IFE of my colleague was broken (we were on a front seat so it was the folding type) and would not held in position. I was unable to sleep at all but those who were had the pleasure of being waken up by the crew 2.25 hours before landing to serve breakfast! The service itself was quite disorganised and the crew not professinnal. A shame this is the only direct flight form CDG to BAH.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,7,2010-09-26,"KUL-BAH BAH-LHR. Kuala Lumpur to Bahrain was upgraded to Business Class on their ancient A340-300 great with the exception of a broken foot rest. Bahrain to London (on ancient A340-300) was a nightmare as there were infants & kids crying all night. It was such a pain having to tolerate the endless wailing for the duration of the flight on an aircraft that has served its shelf life. Gulf Air seriously needs to upgrade their hardware to complement the effort their cabin crew contribute. The other areas which GF needs to focus is their seat pitch (very tight at 32"") and meal quantity.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,7,2010-09-21,DOH-BAH-FRA return. Gulf Air have old airplanes but well maintained. We boarded late and got the sleeper seats. Old IFE system but choices of movie are good spacious leg room in business cabin very helpful staff and great dining.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,2,2010-09-07,KUL-BAH-MCT. KUL-BAH flight IFE not that good less choices of movies. Food good but water was not provided on tray on both service. Crew was not attending call bells. The crew who was serving on our side finally came after almost half an hour waiting and I asked her - she replied that she will serve the water with second service. and we waited for more than 45 min for the second service to start. Upon arrival no crew were at the door bidding us goodbye but instead busy packing their stuff. BAH-MCT served a box of snacks and again no water provided.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,1,2010-07-28,Larnaca-Bahrain-Dubai was the worst flight I have experienced. Delayed 6 hours outbound (BAH- DXB) and delayed 30 hours inbound only for the flight then to be cancelled with no explanation - we got transferred to direct Emirates flight. Outbound the plane was dirty the seat was broken. Also it was obvious to everyone that certain people were smoking in the toilets. This was noticed by two FA's (as they were speaking about it beside me) who proceeded to do absolutely nothing about it!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,8,2010-07-25,DXB-BAH-BKK in Falcon Gold on an A340 and an A330. Inconsistency is the name of the game with Gulf Air. From a premium cabin point of view Gulf Air has three main problems - its aircraft crew and its catering all range from top notch to very poor. DXB-BAH an old looking A340 featuring an equally old and completely outdated interior - legroom in the former First Class seats in row 1/ 2 seemed quite spacious legroom in the four rows that used to be Business Class is very poor. This is Business Class the way it used to be 15 or 20 years ago. On the 55 min flight to Bahrain a small warm meal was served with beverages. The crew was professional and friendly service. In Bahrain I spent some time enjoying the Business class lounge where plenty of food and Champagne was available. BAH-BKK to Bangkok I had seat 1F in a seat I knew from when it used to be First Class. A330s of Gulf Air feature excellent premium cabins although there are always technical problems with the seats. Seats in row 1 and 2 with plenty of space and privacy. Friendly and professional service was provided by flight attendants. A full dinner service provided with continental breakfast before landing. Meal is nicely set up with no use of trays but food presentation and taste could be improved. While plenty of drinks are provided it would be nice if wine was poured from the bottle in the cabin rather than in the galley. Gulf Air claims that sleeper suits are provided but none appeared on this flight. Gulf Air has work to do in terms of quality and consistency but with competitive fares they remain a good value for money choice.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,,2010-07-12,Was booked LHR to BKK but had to cancel due to FCO advice due to violence in Thailand. No refund due to type of fare however Gulf Air are refusing to refund government taxes (£300). Have written to CAA who indicated they are inundated with complaints against this airline. Have tried to call Gulf Air 41 times (8 occasions I got through and once they realised I wanted money from them they hung up) I have actually got recordings of their appalling bad and rude customer service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,5,2010-07-05,CDG to BAH return. Booked on Business was put in Falcon Gold which is the former 1st class. The 8 front seats on the A330 although well worn are comfortablek. With the help of the stewardess managed to lay flat during the night flight but took care not to touch anything until breakfast. The maintenance is obviously poor as I was not the only one with this problem. IFE is not to today's standard (limited choice of films and language and you have to wait for the film to begin without knowing when it will). Breakfast good but the meal on the in-flight was definitely not first class and wines were lower range. Crew in this cabin was nice both ways. No bar open between services. All in all not what you expect from 1st class.,False,,,First Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,5,2010-06-28,CAI-BAH-DXB in Y class. Check in at CAI was smooth. Cabin crew seemed generic and left no impression despite a relatively light load. A340 is by now unbearable and I do recommend against flying GF on their A340s. Wonky IFE bad seats shabby interior make for a really bad experience. Catering was quite poor - the main was alright but salad/desert were terrible. No bread or butter to be seen. Cabin did not give each passengers their own soda can which I find disappointing considering the amount of money a ticket costs. Transfer in BAH was smooth and efficient and I would rate the transfer experience ahead of DXB AUH and even DOH. More seating space in BAH than there was a few years ago. Second leg was an A330-200 better interior snack box more worthwhile and friendlier crew. GF really does need to re-motivate its employees and get rid of those A340s. I find QR to be the better airline although it isn't quite value-for-money as GF is.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,6,2010-06-13,London Heathrow - Bahrain. Flight wasn't full so I found a 3-Seater at the rear end of the A340 and slept. Breakfast was great and attendants professional. Gulf Air needs to replace their aging A340.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,,2010-06-12,BKK-BAH-DOH-BAH-BKK. Probably the worst airline I have ever flown on. I appreciate the A340's are old but there is no excuse for not having hand soap in the toilets or having a faucet that is covered with masking tape so the water flows smoothly - left side toilets in front of seat row 33. There is zero cleaning taking place during the flight and the staff sat at the back and talked throughout the flight without offering service or maintaining the cleanliness of the plane. Paper was heaped on the floor in the toilets and there was limited water. Although staff are pleasant they do not seem happy - god knows how they are not embarrassed to work with such a poor quality airline. There also did not seem enough staff on the plane - during the safety presentation we only had one person in our cabin to do the usual safety seatbelts exits lifejacket routine. My headphone jack did not work on the way back and on the way out it was like being in the 1980's with the poor IFE. Thankfully the plane was not full so I had a whole row to myself to sleep. Its hardly surprising the plane was not full - it was one of the most disgusting plane-rides I have taken - definitely not a three-star airline. At Bahrain airport we were delayed one hour on the BHR-BKK trip and the gate was changed from 35 to 32 during the middle of loading.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,8,2010-06-10,DOH-BAH-DOH delayed for one hour on departure from Doha because the fuel was too hot so they needed to add more fuel to cool it down. I think it is Gulf Air trying to save costs by not refueling in Doha service was average. Outbound flight on A320 the seats were comfortable and the meal was good. Flight attendants friendly inbound flight on time and on A330 very comfortable.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,4,2010-05-30,Bland would be a good resume. I flew economy from Paris to Bahrein and back. A330 looks far from new inside. The seats are similar to Air France economy ones (in other words okay for very small people) - on the way in there was IFE my headset was not working the replacement neither and I had to use my own. On the return one we were on 1st row had more legroom but had to do without IFE at all! Crew does the basics of the job and service acceptable. Food acceptable for economy. If there was any other solution I would not go back on Gulf Air.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,6,2010-05-24,Kuala Lumpur - Bahrain and Bahrain- Paris CDG . Gulf Air A340-300 on KUL-BAH flights are dragging them down in their star ranking compared to the more spacious A330-200 on their BAH- CDG flights. The lack of legroom is so obvious between the two aircraft and it amazes me at the inconsistency of their products. Their flight attendants are top notch and meals are sumptuous though short in quantity. Due to my Silver Status with their FFP I was accorded a complimentary stay at the Golden Tulip in Bahrain for the duration of the 11 hours connecting time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,,2010-03-03,I reserved seats together for my wife and 2 sons but the seats had been given to 3 adult male Bahrainis and my family were expected to be separated. After an argument they were given seats together. The plane was grubby and service lousy. On the return journey the steward gave the impression that serving a woman was beneath him and he treated my wife with ignorance and disdain. They have lost us as customers even if they are the last plane out.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,5,2010-02-20,BAH-MAA. Flight delayed by an hour. Comfortable seating for A321. Food palatable. In-flight service was okay. MAA-BAH take-off delayed by more than two hours! Highly irritating. Otherwise comfortable seating. Palatable food. Decent in-flight service. Pretty expensive compared to Emirates and Etihad. Poor entertainment facility. The only reason to continue flying GF is direct flights to India. Not worth recommending otherwise.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,7,2010-02-01,KWI-BAH-LHR roundtrip on Economy. KWI-BAH on new A321. Check in and security fast seats comfortable and aircraft clean. Flight not busy and crew friendly and upbeat snack box served. No IFE newspapers and magazines were offered. 4 hour connection time in Bahrain used Gulf Air business lounge which despite showing signs of wear still offers good service cold and hot snacks and free wifi. BAH-LHR on A330 got 3 seats by window to myself - not very comfortable for sleeping but better than trying to sleep upright! Plenty of pillows and blankets offered. Crew polite and efficient and food was fine. In flight entertainment not AVOD offered a decent selection. Cleared LHR immigration with IRIS which is great however there was no priority baggage handling. LHR-BAH : now that Gulf Air uses T4 they no longer have their own lounge- they now share with Skyteam. T4 is pretty gloomy at night and most concessions were closed. On plus side security was faster to clear than at T3. A340 left on time crew efficient and minimally polite. Food and comfort decent and early arrival ahead of schedule into Bahrain. Was able to standby for an earlier flight that day. BAH-KWI on A319 busy flight crew were pleasant and courteous. Snack box served. Considering this is economy class not a bad experience and very good value considering the fare I paid.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,2,2010-01-13,LHR-BAH-DAC return. 3 out of 4 flights were late. On outgoing journey we had a six hour connection and this was extended to over 8 hours by the delay but no food was offered. There were no announcements at BAH explaining the delays or giving an accurate idea how long it would be. When the connection arrived boarding took a long time as there did not seem to be enough staff. It was necessary to go through security at BAH to get to connecting flights. Inflight entertainment was poor. Only positive point on DAC-BAH flight we were upgraded to Business class.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,,2010-01-12,LHR-BAH-BKK return. Cramped tatty planes no IFE filthy toilets rude surly and unprofessional check-in staff poor flight attendants and vile food. It’s not that the flights were cheap either. Never again with Gulf Air.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,5,2010-01-10,It is one thing to have luggage arrive late to have the plane leave 5 hours late causing you to miss your next international connection and to have the check in staff laughing and joking about mistakes. But it is additionally troublesome when you get no information and /or information that is so ludicrous it cannot possibly be true and information that is contradictory between agents. This does not build trust in an airline we never will fly Gulf Air again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,1,2010-01-09,London to Manila with stop over at Bahrain - Gulf Air were the cheapest fare. Headphones worked in only one ear. Carpets dirty. Food disgusting and used trays took ages to be taken away. The crew on the plane were alright but check in desk staff were not friendly and more interested in laughing and joking with each other than serving.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,,2010-01-08,Flight to Dubai initially delayed one hour then three. Was offered flight to Abu Dhabi plus a taxi ride - took this option as I needed to get to a meeting - and then 30 minutes later that was cancelled. If Bahrain wants to be 'business friendly' it needs to have a reliable schedule of flights provided by Gulf Air!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,8,2009-12-17,DAM-BAH-KUL. Flight delayed out of Damascus but was above the Minimum Connecting Time so my family and I were not worried. Crew attentive. From Bahrain the flight was full crew attentive and did an excellent job. The problem was their aged A340 and clogged toilets. When Gulf Air receives new aircraft their product will be far better.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,1,2009-12-14,BAH-BKK in Economy. Cramped seats plane 100% full. IFE where I was was falling apart and wouldn't extend. Sound only coming out of one headphone because of a fault in the seat. Meals gone downhill since I knew it. I used to fly a lot before to LHR in previous years. Cabin attendants are hurried and rushed. On the return it was just as bad and there were no IFE at all. The last time I fly with Gulf long-haul unless new planes arrive.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,5,2009-12-11,LHR-BKK-LHR. The outward flights were overbooked and service delivery slow and painful. Two point service from front of economy to the rear with the usual 1 choice of meal left at the end. I found the crew reasonably good. IFE ok but not on demand and some of the channels were jumping around. Bahrain is a great airport cosy all the facilities you require and a great duty free area. On return the flight from BKK to BAH was again overbooked and had no seat back tvs. The headphones had no cushion covers for the earpieces and no blankets but crew good - you do have to ask for drinks. BAH-LHR very pleasant as there was only about 45 of us onboard so loads of room attentive service and good IFE. If looking for a good price and reasonable service then give Gulf a go via Bahrain for good duty free.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Gulf Air customer review,1,2009-11-18,On the first leg from LHR to Bahrain the plane was filthy trays hadn't been cleaned and we were put right at the back of the plane - so by the time we got any food there wasn't anything worth having. Second leg Bahrain to Bangkok even worse - no inflight entertainment and plane was also very dirty. Staff were pleasant enough but nothing compared with Qatar Emirates and Etihad. Booked with Gulf Air as I thought it would save me money - but for the sake of £50 next time I will choose another airline. Watch out when you get to Bahrain - they tell you one gate number and then it suddenly changes so its a mad dash to get to the right gate in time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Gulf Air customer review,,2009-11-05,Flight delayed Bahrain to Jeddah (Monday). Now Wednesday and stuck in Jeddah - flight back to Bahrain is also delayed this time by more than 3 hours. Dont know why I bother it's just a never ending story with Gulf Air. Advise that you avoid Gulf whenever possible!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
