Always down. So accessing flight details or making changes is a nightmare, which makes the luggage bullet below even more frustrating.

I lost money by buying 25kg of luggage when my bag actually weighed less than 22kg. It’s crazy to expect customers to be able to predict their bag weight to the nearest kilogram, so inevitably people presumably end up buying more than they need.

Finally, my turn to check in at the counter came, it was about 3.00pm then. The check in staff of Thai Lion Air looked at me like I am an idiot. She took my passport away and came back about 5 minutes later. She told me that ""Madame, you flight time changed, Madame, 3.30pm, hurry up. No check in luggage now, cannot load. All carry-on Madame"". I was totally shocked, literally. She only gave me my passport and boarding pass and kept urging 'Hurry up, hurry up'.

The staff were uninterested in the fact that their webpage didn't work. Long story short - I decided to buy an entirely new ticket for the same flight with 20 kgs included (150 US$).

On January 26th, 2019 I flew Thai Lion Air from Bangkok to Denpasar. I purchased the ticket online for US$166.71 and at the airport was charged an additional check-in baggage at US$110.53 for a total of US$277.23 The website is designed with the intent to deceive. I have since notice that links in website have change regularly and/or have numerous dead links as they were at the time of my booking. I read ""inclusive of baggage"". I also read ""20 kg check in baggage allowance on international flights"". In small print I read ""as of January 15, 2019"". When I clicked the link the website went on at great length as to details for baggage but no fees that I could see were indicated. A reasonable rate for check-in baggage is not accepted upon check-in unless arriving four hours prior. I did in-fact arrive at the check-in counter four hours prior to the departure and was asked to come back an hour later because the check-in attendants were dealing with flights earlier than mine. Check-in attendants were not busy and the line was short so there was no reason not to accept me upon arrival. Regardless, I had no reason to rush and waited by the side. When I returned 3 hours prior to departure the availability of paying a lower rate for check in baggage had expired. My check-in baggage for an international trip lasting more than three weeks was less than 12kg. I was told by the service manager at the counter that the rate of TB3,500 was the best that could be offered. I was not given any other options other than to pay the full fee on top of a relatively high seat cost. Afterwards I was aware that there are several options that passengers took advantage of. I’ve spoken to other passengers regarding Lion Air. The opinions are not flattering and I wish this had been brought to my attention before. Examples include a passenger flying in transit to Australia that negotiated a highly discounted baggage fee which demonstrates Lion Air's inconsistent policy. Furthermore many passengers carry-on more than one bag most exceeding the size and weight stipulated by the metal rack the counter. Descriptions and photographs of the meals offered are grossly misrepresented. The image of pieces of chicken and sauce as depicted are not the gravy-soaked rice that is served.

Our team of 15 pax flies often on their domestic and international routes and since we’re usually quite satisfied we’ll continue to do so but don’t fall into the trap of their expensive Premium Seat scam. All their seats are the same. They all have the same width and the “pitch” (the distance for your legs to extend between your row and the row in front of you) is identical in all the rows. At high extra additional prices they sell “Hot Seats”: rows 1-5 in red color, in the front. The seat size is identical but they promise “Priority Boarding” (you’ll be first on) and Priority Disembarkation (you’ll be first off). I attach their promises. The respect neither promise! Being low-cost they rarely use “elephant trunks” (those mobile passageways which for disembarkation allow you to walk directly from the plane to the gate, or for boarding from the gate to the plane). Instead of the elephant trunks they use busses for the transfers to and from the plane. Only One bus is used and all the pax board and disembark simultaneously. No priority whatsoever. When they do use an elephant trunk they board rows 1-20 simultaneously, without any priority or, even worse, they board the back rows first. Thereby, if you’ve been dumb enough to pay for their “priority boarding” you’ll be the last pax to board and you’ll find the overhead bins, in your own front rows, all already fully packed and little or no space for your own carry-ons.

We didn’t get that in our two way ticket (it wasn’t explained clearly but still took the blame for it). We had to pay over 300$ CAN for our extra weight penality because we had 2 luggages weighing a little under 20kg (which is the norm for most airplane companies). So 4-5 days before our next flight departure, I called them to know how exactly I can pay for extra weight. They told me I can’t pay over the phone because they don’t take credit cards from Canada, United States, Japan and a few other countries over the phone. So they told me to pay via internet or come 4 hours prior to my flight at the airport to pay. Keep in mind that they know I’m leaving at 8 am. So first I try via internet with their website to pay for my extra luggages weight - it would deny my credit card payments. I tried at least 6 times during 3 days and it just would not work. So we were forced to go 4 hours earlier to the airport. Our flight was at 8 am so we had to get to the airport at least 5 hours ealier to get a chance to pay for our luggages. When we got there around 3 am the gates were not opened and I had to get to another terminal to get help from their office.

I asked the info center to call the cargo departement to see if they could actually help me. Cargo Departement told me that the airline had to help me and to call them back. I was so frustrated to lose hours of sleep to be played like that. Got on the phone with airline again and told them they had to make it work because this was nonsense. They told me they could not help and kept telling me to contact the Cargo Department, again.

Unlike other low-cost airlines in the region, this one has a baggage allowance and get you a small snack/water (unnecessary in my case but nevertheless a pleasant move). A slight delay on departure wasn't a major thing, I generally enjoyed the flight with them.",False,Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SIN to DMK,March 2016,4,4,,4,4,,True,
"""acceptable to fly short haul""",6,2016-03-28,"Bangkok to Chiang Mai. Thai Lion Air is an acceptable airline to fly short haul. I tried to purchase a few extra options via website but not successful. Call Center is very difficult to reach and processing those requests cost a lot more money, so I give up. When onboard, I tried to buy a hot meal but was explained that one will be sold on flight longer than 2 hours only (not mentioned in their website). I think they still have minor problem to work on, but at least the flight are on time.

"""frustrating experience""",1,2016-01-29,"Thai Lion Air flight change/cancellation is disgusting. I booked a flight from Bangkok to Krabi for the 29th February, and realized soon after I had made a mistake, and needed a flight for a day later. Fair, I made a mistake, and would expect there to be some form of charge to do this. However they told me that in order to make a change I would have to pay 750 THB per person, and that I couldn't make this payment on anything except a Thai or Singapore credit card. I basically paid this amount for the flight to begin with, so essentially would have had to pay for another ticket all together, even though I was making this change more than a month in advance. Beyond that, when I had paid for the tickets on a Canadian credit card, they were telling me I could not make this from Canada now, and would have to do it in Thailand by the 4th if I wanted to change this, when I wouldn't even be arriving until the 29th. When I asked them to cancel the flight, and that I would just rebook through them, they offered me only 200 THB back in total, which was basically the equivalent to $7-8 Canadian when the flight cost me $73. Again, a month in advance notice - just bought the tickets days before. Very frustrating experience.",False,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,DMK to KBV,January 2016,,,,,1,,False,
""" never use this airline again""",1,2016-01-11,"First Thai Lion Air flight was delayed 4 hours (for a 1 hour flight might add). Out of fear that my return flight would be delayed (I had an onward flight only 1 hour after it), I used the call center to change the flight. On hold on and off for nearly 25 minutes. I requested a change in flight free of charge, as a courtesy for the 4 hour delay of the first flight. No customer service at all. When they refused, I agreed to pay the fee for changing and in the end, she said I could not change it because I needed a Singaporean credit card. Complete waste of 30 minutes with the call center. The woman said to go to the airport early and I could change/pay then. Arriving at the airport 3 hours early, 1. they also wouldn't change the flight free of charge and 2. flight could only be changed up until 4 hours before the flight, which the call center did not tell me. The woman was rude and useless, ""we are a budget airline"" - so I guess this means no customer service! On the spot, I booked with Air Asia. Will never use this airline again.

Moreover it has a generous 20kg free baggage allowance and free seat selection. Plane is new, and the seat pitch on its Boeing 737-800 is wider than its Boeing 737-900ER, thus it's quite a comfortable 2 hours flight. Free snacks in the form of biscuits and small drinking water. The meals on sale is not too expensive either. Cabin staff are generally friendly. Return flight in the late afternoon was delayed, a common problem for all budget airline.

Thai Lion Air customer review,5,2016-01-04,"Phuket to Bangkok. Thai Lion Air is a low cost carrier and that this is not based on a single flight, but multiple flights on Thai Lion Air.  They have a free and generous luggage allowance, the aircraft are new and clean, they give a small water and a snack on all flights, seats are slightly wider than a normal LCC. Now the bad news - they might have least amount of leg room of any airline I've flown, at 5'11"" sitting upright my knees are pressed hard on the back of the seat in front of me. I'm not sure what the issue is but they always fly their planes very warm. The staff working the flights though attractive seem somewhat cold and indifferent - it's not the warm Asian service you come to expect.",False,Boeing 737-900ER,Family Leisure,Economy Class,HKT to DMK,January 2016,1,3,,4,4,,False,
"""missed connecting flight""",1,2016-01-04,"Singapore to ChiangMai via Bangkok. I have a connecting flight from Bangkok to Chiang Mai, however the delay of flight from Singapore to Bangkok and delay in baggage arrival has caused me to missed my connecting flight. There was zero follow through service on the ground by Thai Lion Air crew. Upon arrival at Don Mueang Airport, while waiting for our baggage at the conveyor belt, we informed one of Thai Lion Air ground staff about our situation. After the ground staff walkie talkie to her colleague at the check-in counter, we were then told to go to your check-in counter that is located so far away without any formal direction or guidance. When reached the counter, it was a massive chaos. We are already short of time – and yet we have to RE-CHECK IN our baggage and go through immigration and security checks. But none of Thai Lion Air staff actually follow through and provide any form of assistance. Eventually, we missed the connecting flight and have to reschedule to the next available flight which was 6.5 hours later. For me to reschedule the flight, I have to explain the situation multiple times to different Thai Lion Air crew in order for me to get the situation sorted out and have the admin charges waived. But they still charge me an additional SGD72 for the price difference. The total amount I paid for this terrible budget carrier is ridiculous. All in all, unless there are no other flights in the world, and desperate to fly out, then Thai Lion Air can be the choice.",False,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,SIN to CNX via DMK,December 2015,3,3,,1,1,,False,
