"""Never travel Iraqi Airways again""",1,2019-09-17,"Manchester to Erbil.  We checked in with our luggage and showed that two of the female passengers also held a small handbags with them, we showed this at the check in with no problem. When at the gate to board in, one of the female passengers went on board with another family to help them since the family was of one mother and 3 children. When my self and my wife went to the gate to board they stopped us, telling us we had to pay £50 extra for the handbag that was our daughters handbag we were holding for her. They told us we either had to pay £50 cash or they would throw out things away or they would not let us board the plane. They would not accept my card payment at all, even though that's what I wanted to pay with. They also refused to give us any receipt.

"""B737 had good leg room""",9,2018-01-19,"I took 3 domestic flights with Iraqi Airways - from Basra to Baghdad and then a return to Sulaymaniyah. One was on a smaller Bombardier and the others on a B737. The Basra flight was delayed a couple of hours because of fog. No problems with that, it happens. I missed my next flight (on a different ticket to Erbil). The later flights were all full, so they changed my ticket to Sulaymaniyah at no cost. All aircraft's were good, particularly the B737 which was not very old at all. The B737 had good leg room, was clean, in flight entertainment and a reasonable snack was served. The smaller Bombadier, whilst a little older was perfectly OK. Overall, a good experience.",True,Boeing 737,Business,Economy Class,Sulaymaniyah to Baghdad,January 2018,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",4,5,,,True
