"""don’t waste your time and money on this flight""",1,2022-05-24,I am not able to do web check in and their customer care number is on hold for like an hour! Why should I face consequences due to their negligent behaviour. Booking for the first time and such a bad experience! Won’t regret writing this review!

"""air hostesses were rude and busy in their own gossiping""",2,2022-05-19,"The airplane was supposed to take off at 15.35 but we flew late. During the entire journey the arc’s in the cabin were not working, with such hot weather outside and no AC in the cabin all the passengers were agitated and were sweating. The air hostess did not care and kept saying that it will work in 15-20min. The air hostesses were rude and busy in their own gossiping. Worst flight ever.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New Delhi to Chandigarh,May 2022,1,1,,1,1,,,False
"""The seats were small""",1,2019-08-27,"Not Verified |  Port Macquarie to Brisbane. Dreadful. The age of the plane is ok, however the claustrophobic set up of the cabin is dreadful. The seats were small. We are average sized and were wondering how we were going to fit into the chairs. I have a chronic pain condition and within 20 minutes I was beside myself with being cramped into such a small place. No knee room, no room to reach anything in your handbag on the floor, barely can you put your tray table down. The water and white bread half sandwich was pretty random, not even a cup of tea. How on earth you fit so many overweight people in those seats is beyond me. What happens when large people book 1 seat? Which is the size of half a normal seat?",False,Fokker 100,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Port Macquarie to Brisbane,August 2019,1,3,,1,1,,,False
"""seem to be doing acceptable job""",6,2017-08-05,"✅ Verified Review |  Gladstone to Brisbane. I booked this flight through Virgin Australia website. But later I found out that Virgin ceased his service for some cities and gave it over to a new commercial airline called Alliance Airlines. The aircraft was a Fokker 70 with old interior look. The legroom was very tight. The airline's magazine was the only entertainment on board which hadn't been prepared tastefully. On the positive side, the crew were the most friendly cabin crew I've seen in Australian airlines. The complimentary snack (it was a 7:30am flight) was better than what Virgin used to offer. However, the only drink available was water. It is expected for an airline to offer coffee and tea in the morning, at least they can sell a few options on board. The flight time was shorter than usual as it wasn't a propeller aircraft. Handling at both airport was done by Virgin Australia so it wasn't really related to this review. Generally, it's good that a new competitor is entering the market. As a beginner in this sector, they seem to be doing acceptable job. But they should improve some issues to become a rival to other airlines in regional Australia.",False,Fokker 70,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Gladstone to Brisbane,August 2017,1,5,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",4,4,,,True
