"""will never again fly Spirit""",1,2022-11-20,"Not Verified | This is the worst airline you could ever fly on. There was no friendly people greeting you anywhere on or off the air plane. They're all doing their own thing. The only time that they wanted to interact with you or were concerned with you is to make sure you were paying extra for anything that you needed to pay extra for. Absolutely the most uncomfortable seats you could ever possibly sit in. For a 4-Hour flight we were never offered anything to eat or drink. They did however say that you could pay for things like food or drink and water. However no ever came to even offer not even to buy they food items. The only thing they came by to do was to see if you wanted to sign up for their credit card. Everything was an extra cost your baggage, food, anything you could want was all nickel and dimed. Also this was not a cheap flight it was the most expensive way I've ever taken and that was before all the extra charges and fees. Their baggage fees are also higher than anyone else's. My trip is not over I still have to fly home and I am dreading the flight home on Spirit Airlines all I want to do is cancel my flight and get on a different one but I know that they will heavily penalize me and charge me even more money.

Before purchasing we checked Spirit review ratings and was leery of the, under 2.5, star rating. I decided to also check the reviews of a more pricy airline and they were no better. The poor reviews for Spirit mostly revolves around the addition of fees for upgraded services that other airlines consider standard and will not charge for. For instance, the charges for a carry-on bag. As Spirit allows a personal item (yes it’s super teeny tiny) without adding a fee, I knew I could comply with their regulations AND not have to upgrade anything. Additionally, if you are not super tech savvy, you may wish to upgrade to use a staff person at their kiosk (this is an added fee too). As long as you print you pass at home or take a screen shot of it, you will be good to go! The staff were smiling, humorous and fun! As I read one review of a sort of grimy staff person that added tons of fees to a passenger due to large bags being traveled with, I was initially worried this could happen to me. As my personal item followed their rules, all was well. Basically, know that they will charge you extra for carry on bag(s) and that during check-in the site makes you jump through tons of extra screens to complete check-in.

"2its inhumane customer service""",1,2022-09-08,"I flew via Spirit Airlines several times over 5 years ago, with relatively okay experiences without any major complaints. However, this time around, Spirit Airlines really etched their poor reputation in my memory forever. My son, mother-in-law, and nephew and niece flew Spirit Airlines in September 2022 and their experience was horrible. My husband and I booked their tickets scheduled to fly from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic to Newark, NJ with a stop in Fort Lauderdale. The layover in Fort Lauderdale would be for 45 minutes. We figured this was an excellent one-stop trip since the layover was very short. However, at no moment did the airline warn us at any time during the checkout process that international luggage must be picked up and re-checked at the layover destination. When we booked the 4 tickets, we assumed that the luggage would go directly to Newark airport, but we were wrong. My mother-in-law did not find out they would need to pick up and re-check the luggage until she arrived at Fort Lauderdale. Remember, the layover was only 45 minutes; if we had known that they would have to re-check their luggage, we would have purchased a flight with a longer layover to give them ample time to recheck the luggage without missing the flight. Of course, my mother-in-law and the three children missed their flight. They had already been on the road since 11pm of the day prior, so this was really disappointing to discover. But the headache only began at the missed flight. My husband immediately called Spirit Airlines to try and get them into the next flight that would fly directly to Newark. The agent had the audacity to try to charge us $1,400 for 4 tickets to Newark when they never warned us the luggage would need to be re-checked. On top of this, the agent says not to worry since Spirit Airline would refund us the money through a voucher. A voucher. Has Spirit Airlines heard of inflation? Do they think that throwing $1,400 comes easy to the average family? What good is a voucher when I need cash to pay bills now? What good is a voucher for the very airline I am disappointed and disgusted by? The headache still does not end here either, unfortunately. Finally, the agent was able to book a later flight free of charge; however, the flight would make another stop in Orlando with a layover of 7 hours and land in Atlantic City, 3 hours away from our original home airport. You can imagine how these kids, ranging in age from 5-11 years old might have felt or how overwhelmed and exhausted my mother-in-law was, having to manage 3 kids for over 24 hours in 4 different airports. As I write this review, my mother-in-law, son, and niece/nephew are still on their way home from the airport and will arrive at approximately 1 in the morning with a total of 26 hours between the start of their voyage to the end. Upon booking, we wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt and assumed that surely, people had above average expectations for an economy airline. Disappointingly, Spirit Airlines did live up to its poor reputation due to its inhumane customer service, lack of flexibility, exorbitant charges, and lack of transparency. At the very least, Spirit Airlines needs to warn international customers that they need to re-check their luggage at their layover destination and should keep this in mind when selecting their flight and not charge layover customers who miss their flight due to lack of time to re-check luggage.

I spent an hour on hold and talking to a representative to eventually move my flight to November 1 so I could at least not miss the retreat. This meant my friend who was also going and booked separately had to contact Spirit as well and spend the same amount of time trying to move her flight to the 1st and try to secure the seat next to mine like we originally had. I then had to go and pay for a hotel room in Puerto Vallarta the night of the 1st due to them canceling my flight, forcing me to go a day earlier. An extra expense I have to eat- But hey, at least I will make it to my retreat. Nope. Not the case. Received an email today that you canceled my flight on November 1.  Called and went through the queue and automated prompts to finally get a live person. This live agent proceeds to tell me that the flight was canceled due to unforeseen circumstances. I asked what those circumstances were and he couldn’t tell me. Later in the call he tells me that I was the one who called and canceled my flight.  I literally laughed out loud and asked him if I was in the twilight zone. Then later in the conversation the reason the flight was canceled was something entirely different. It was due to a schedule change. He told me I could get a spirit credit. No thanks!

I told him that he would need to find me an alternate flight for the same price because flights were now between $1500 and $1700. He put me on hold (again) for an eternity. Probably wasn’t doing any checking but was sitting there playing a video game or having a snack I would guess. Because every time he put me on hold and came back he had no new information for me but would feed me some different story, almost as if he forgot what he had already told me. This time however, he suddenly tells me that they will go ahead and reinstate my reservation since I’m telling them I didn’t cancel it and the flight is available. What?!!!! In the hell is going on?!!! By this point I just decided to cut my losses and tell him I wanted my money back in the original form of payment as opposed to a spirit credit.

Crew was there before plane arrives.  Regarding the seats, this is the first time I sit on regular economy seats, they have similar pad ergonomics compared to Alaska or AA. You just don’t notice it because the back is “naked” (so it gives the perception that it’s a regular plastic chair). This flight had wifi service, which is was not aware. I noticed people complaining about the carry on or luggage fees at the airport. And that’s the fundamental problem with some passengers: they don’t pay attention to the ticket purchase process or they think they can bend the rules. In my case I was traveling to spend the night in Orlando and fly back the next day. So no carry on, didn’t really care about a dedicated seat and my personal item was small.

So I spent a total of $116 for a single bag to fly it would’ve been cheaper to charge me for two bags. In total it cost me twice as much to fly one bag as it did my daughter. For a airline to be a budget airline this is by far the worst experience we have ever had. Not only is this not a budget airline they treated my daughter terribly at the check-in counter. This company uses horrendous tactics to to inflate the price so you are no longer paying a budget price and you will have no choice but to pay their horrendous fees.

I'm talking to you! We are saving those for bigger items, put it underneath the seat in front of you, I had two more bags with me so I tried to do it but it didn't fit, so I put it in the cabinet on top of my seat. The flight was full and the spots were filling up very quickly a couple of passengers put their bags next to mine with no problems until the bin was full. Suddenly the same crew member who was wearing an apron came back with a bigger bag and told us see, I told you these bins are for bigger items grabbing my bag and giving back to my wife while yelling I told you this has to go underneath your seat, I tried to explain to her that it didn't fit and she shushed me, totally unprofessional and very rude, I told her don't shush me and she said well don't talk back to me. My wife told her if that's the case I'm going to carry it here with me and she said that we were putting in danger the passenger that was sitting next to us. I told her well that is why I was putting it on top and she goes well there is no room, I said there was room when I board the plane. Then she said you know what if you are not going to cooperate whatever and she starting walking to the front of the plane. She grabbed some papers and start looking for who knows what. She came back and said again this bag has to be underneath the seat, because the top is reserved for people that paid for it like the one she put instead of mine. I told her well guess what I paid $11.00 to be a priority boarding to find a place right on top of my seat like Spirit advertise when they charge you the fee. When I told them that during the boarding of the plane they looked at me like if I was just coming up with it and they didn't know what I was talking about, so don't fall for it you are giving them free money. The staff member said again whatever are you going to do it or not? I said I have to otherwise you will kick me out of the plane, I've seen plenty of videos where an empowered flight attendant kicks customers out of a plane for no reason.

In this regard Spirit Airlines dropped the ball and failed me miserably. My June 10th travels from Salt Lake City Utah to Nashville Tennessee went wrong with an air traffic control delay of a little more than an hour in my connecting city of Orlando Florida. The Salt Lake City flight touched down in Orlando at 1:25 PM. The airline chose to let the Nashville Flight take off at its on time scheduled 1:40 PM departure. I literally walked into the terminal while that flight was still on the ground. A delay of the Nashville flight of just 20 minutes would have meant that I, and about 20 other travelers would have made our connecting flight. I have seen other airlines hold another flight at the gate so connections can be made. Spirit decided that this was not important enough for us. There was no other flights leaving for Nashville that day on Spirit Airlines. I can understand that sometimes command decisions have to be made with other circumstances to take into consideration. I even might have been able to accept the decision to let the Nashville flight leave on time if Spirit airline had taken an active roll in aiding those of us stranded in Orlando; however, Spirit Airline did absolutely nothing for us. I inquired at the gate about what I should do and was told to inquire at an information desk that was about two gates away. A large group of us went to the information desk and stood to wait for help. Two employees were behind the desk. Just after we approached, one employee took his jacket and left. The other was there a few more minutes as a document was printing. She then took her documents and left. We stood for about 20 minutes waiting for another employee to arrive. No one ever came. Another employee walking by then informed the group that we needed to proceed to the ticketing counter. As a group we went to another terminal and went to the ticketing counter to be told that we had been book onto flights for the following day. We were told that our only options were take the flight the next day or take a refund for that part of the trip. That was the extent of the aid we received from Spirit Airline. No help in finding accommodations. No help in finding another airline with a flight. Not even so much as a “let me upgrade your seat.” Customer service is about showing those in difficult circumstances that you value them.

"""Turned into an absolute nightmare""",1,2022-05-30,"Not Verified |  We wanted to travel to Vegas to get married and enjoy some nice weather and a nice vacation. What was an awesome week of fun and family fun with a wedding. Turned into an absolute nightmare and costs lots of extra money and made us think we were never going to get home. We were also traveling with a 3 year old. I wish I would have read the reviews from Consumer Affairs about Spirit as I would have paid ten times what we did in order to not have to deal with this scam of a company. Our original flight home was supposed to leave early Saturday morning 5/20 and of course we got to the airport extra early so we weren’t rushed. Needless to say our flight was delayed multiple times until we we were finally able to board almost 4 hours later. Well after loading the plane and waiting for what seemed like hours we were told to deboard due to AC issues. They thought they could fix it. So we waited around again only for the flight to be cancelled . At this point we had been at the airport for well over 7 hours and no way to get home anytime soon. We were were told there were no more spirit planes going out to Milwaukee until Monday. They said we would get meal vouchers and hotel vouchers until we could get a flight out. Well. Needless to say we never got any emails for either and by the time we got up to the counter they were out of hotel vouchers. Not once during this Afternoon did we get an apology from anyone. Just attitude. My wife was able to get us booked on another flight for Monday morning again in spirit. I should have known better. Not only were we now stuck in Vegas till Monday we had no place to stay and no rental car to get anywhere. We somehow found a room at the Luxor with our friends but it was over $500 for 2 nights due to EDC festival. We ended up having to place a Walmart delivery order as were running out of stuff for our toddler. Another early morning came and we were at the airport early again for a 9:20 flight. Surely we would not get cancelled again? Well if I was betting man I should have put 1,000,000 on us not getting home for almost another day, after several other delays and boarding and deboarding our flight was cancelled again. It was again due to mechanical issues as well as staff this time as the attendants timed out. And guess what no spirit flights until Thursday. Well I was smart this time and called my dad and had him book us southwest so we could get home. The one caveat was that we would get home at 1am Milwaukee time. So we basically spent another full day at the airport. And the kicker was while we’re were waiting for this spirit flight to be cancelled I had a spirit employee threaten to fight me and “take me out” because I asked if could get my stroller for my son. Who at this point was beyond tired and cranky. And still no apology from spirit. We did talk with a manager who was useless and basically said we could go online and submit everything for reimbursement. Again no apology from her and terrible attitude. We did make it home finally.

"""Never again""",1,2022-05-28,"Not Verified |  Orlando to Las Vegas. I am tired of calling and getting different answers regarding a mistake Spirit Airlines made that I ultimately had to pay for, literally. On May 14 I flew from Orlando, FL to Detroit MI, for a flight that was supposed to connect in Detroit to take us to Las Vegas, NV. Our plane arrived late & we were delayed for an hour & change more once we'd boarded the plane. Because of this I missed my connecting flight from Detroit, MI to Las Vegas, NV. The flight attendant came over the speaker & advised that all 19 of us who were supposed to be on that connecting flight would be rebooked for a 9:00 AM flight out of Detroit into Las Vegas. When we got off the flight I asked the guest service agent to confirm this was the case & they said they didn't know & to call customer service to confirm. We waited over 45 minutes to get our bags, so I figured I'd call to make sure I was all set before now spending more money to find a hotel in the area. I literally spent 3 hours calling Spirit's ""customer service"" if you even want to call it that. In this time, I called at least 6 different times & was placed on indefinite holds, hung up on twice, & advised that I could not be rebooked. By this point I was furious & exhausted from the travel day & still looking for somewhere to sleep for what ended up being two hours. I called one last time & immediately requested a supervisor & who finally explained that I was marked as a ""no show"" for the flight from Orlando to Detroit, which is why I couldn't be booked. This is impossible, because I literally waited in the line & then weighed & checked my bag in. The supervisor also advised that there wasn't a 9 AM flight out of Detroit to Las Vegas, but there was a 10:03 AM flight the following morning. I explained to her that I needed to be on that flight & that there was ONE seat left. I was traveling to Las Vegas for a concert that I had already spent a lot of money to attend, thus I could not afford to miss. She explained that she would need to have this ""no show"" tag removed before she could rebook me & I asked how long this would take, as there was one seat left. She advised that she can't give a set timeframe, as it varies so we agreed that the next best thing would be fore me to rebook the flight with her over the phone with her, to ensure I was on the flight. She also confirmed several times that I would be able to get a REFUND on this new flight I had to purchase for $342 once the tag was removed. I did want to spend this extra money because of their mistake, but I also couldn't afford to miss out on the show. The supervisor I spoke with reassured me several times on the call that she would be able to call me back once the tag was removed, read a script to me, & refund my new flight of $342. She called me the following morning, on the 14th, around 9 AM I believe & read me the script & I felt much better. Now, two weeks later I've never gotten an email or any kind of follow up from Spirit Airlines regarding my refund, so I call in & I'm advised that there was a refund of $112 to the original method of payment. I had already explained to the supervisor who booked my new flight that I did not have that old debit card any more & I still have yet to be contacted or refunded.

"""Definitely won’t do business through them again""",1,2022-05-16,"I definitely don’t recommend Spirit Airlines. They have terrible communication and are not trustworthy in my opinion. Back in February my mom, dad and uncle had a flight through them. The flight was early in the morning. We had arrived at the airport with plenty of time. When they went up to the check in when you first walk in they got told their flight was closed. Keep in mind I had pre checked in through their app and the flight status on the app said nothing of it being closed. The only reason they went to the check in desk was for a wheelchair! After being confused and trying to understand what to do next they said that no more baggage could be on the plane. When it was said they had no baggage they were then told they could go. They head upstairs now in a very big rush after wasting lots of time because they were told it was closed by a Spirit employee. Again now keep in mind my Father has ALS and can barely get around as it is so now he can’t breathe rushing around to try and make it. They barely make it there and then were told they couldn’t get on. They and a few others that this happen were told the airline can shut down and close the flight up to 45 mins early due to weather. But, they were there plenty before 45 mins and were told around over an hour before the flight it was closed (I have the texts confirming what time they told them it was closed). On top of that it took my dad a bit longer to get through security due to not being able to empty his own pockets or stand in the machine with your hands up so they had to take him aside and check him with their hands. Again would of had plenty of time if they weren’t told it was closed! After being told they couldn’t get on the flight the rude employee also told them they are lucky they had American Airlines on the way back or they would have canceled the flight back as well. By the way I love flying American and highly recommend them. My parents then drove a long distance again to Green Bay to catch a flight out because they said no flights were available until Sunday and this was a Friday. So they spent over $600 to catch new flights. My mom called Spirit Airlines phone number to see what could be done and was told that whoever she was speaking to couldn’t handle this situation and that she had to submit a form through email and then they would have to investigate everything and get back to her.

This way they appear to be a ""budget"" airline option except they make it impossible to for the average traveler to take their flight as advertised, they make it impossible to avoid paying extra fees for literally ""everything"" except the air you breathe, until the cost of your trip turns out to be as much or more than the regular airlines. Example: you pay for carry on and checked bags and have to pay for them ahead of time. Oversized or overweight bags costs more still but you have no way of knowing that what Spirit considers overweight or oversized is different than what you think they would be, i e. the industry standard for overweight is 50 lbs on every other airline I've ever traveled on, so I think I'm good, but for them it's 41 lbs so my 45 lb bag costs another $50 dollars for 4 extra lbs. But since there are fees for everything it's not like I can take out the 4 lbs and put it my other bag to avoid the fee as that would still cost me $50 since the other bag would then be overweight. Its not that they charge extra money for stuff that is standard from other airlines, if they want to be a budget airline and we're up front and clear about their fee structure then no problem.

On top of that, they actually tried to make me pay $100 for a rebooking despite the fact that the only reason I missed my flight was because their precheck QR codes did not scan and they had ridiculous policy that wouldn't let me get a physical pass. I had to fight for a free rebooking and sleep on the floor until the next day. Flying from Atlanta to Hawaii. Had a connecting flight in LA with a 4 hour layover. Atlanta flight got delayed with no prior warning. Ended up delayed about 3 hours. Got to LA late, missed my connecting flight. Had to rebook to fly into Honolulu instead of Maui. Had to buy my own ticket from Maui to Honolulu on my own dime. Slept overnight at Honolulu Airport to catch a 6am flight to Maui.

The return flight was to depart at 3:20 pm and arrive at 5:30, however I got to Louisville around 8pm. This time they had a plane at the gate just not enough flight attendants.

Also, there are no USB ports to charge any electronic devices and the tray tables are TINY. also you are charged 3.50 for water.

The next day, I tried about 15 different times calling both the Spirit main number and the specific baggage department number. the people I spoke to from the main number basically said they could do nothing for me. I was never able to get a hold of anyone using the baggage number...it had me on hold for 25 minutes and then abruptly hung up on me 3 separate times.

About 4-5 hours later we are updated from the site that the flight was canceled and delayed until the following date 2/3/2022 at 6:50 am.

So I caught COVID when I was supposed to fly out right after Xmas in December 2021. I cancelled my flight in time and was expecting incidental fees to be tacked on. No big deal. I got a reservation credit. I now want to fly Spirit again, but this time for a destination in Mexico. I want to use this reservation credit, which does not expire until the end of March 2022. First, there are flights on Google Flights that are substantially cheaper than flights on the official Spirit Airlines website. In fact, the flight that I am about to book on Google is listed as ""full"" and thus ""unavailable"" on the Spirit Airlines website. So already this airline is acting mighty shady. Then I go to customer service to see if I can use the reservation credit through Google Flights. I wait for an hour the first time around and then hang up. Then I go to the Spirit Airlines ""chat"" feature for customer service and twice I am logged out. Both log-outs were made to look like I already was serviced by a customer agent when in fact I was not. Then I call again, readying myself for an hour plus when I get a human being within seconds. Surprised, I am excited that I will finally settle this situation, by first asking what's the deal with the different prices on Google Flights when compared to the Spirit Airlines website. This human being then proceeds to tell me that Google Flights is a ""third party"".  Then when I ask if I can extend my reservation credit deadline from beyond the end of March 2022, he says that I need to call a week before the expiration date and that ""rules and conditions"" will apply. I then ask where these ""rules and conditions"" sit within the Spirit Airline website and I am directed ""Contract of Carriage,"" which provides me little information on what ""rules and conditions"" apply. I want specific reasons why he won't tell me why these ""rules and conditions"" are so vague, and not even in the contract. He gives me more generalities. I was hoping the manager would clarify with me precisely what ""rules and conditions"" apply for that discussion about the status of my reservation credit one week before the expiration date. .

"""I would not recommend anybody""",1,2022-01-04,"The problems began at the check-in to my departure flight (EWR-MCO,) where I was pulled aside for a few minutes while every other passenger boarded next to me. The employee checking me in was on the phone while attempting to check me in, and seemed confused but to not care much at the same time. I was finally allowed on the flight with just a few passengers left to board. The flight to Orlando was perfect, and everything was fine except for the checked baggage taking exceptionally long to arrive after landing. The day before my return flight, I called in to see if there was any possibility of pushing my flight back (as I had seen multiple seats available for later flights online.) After waiting on hold for approximately a half hour, I was connected to an agent who then told me that I had no flight booked. Upon more holds and investigating, I was informed that my return flight was cancelled due to me ""not arriving"" to my departure flight. After further discussion, I was told my only option was to re-instate my initial flight for a $30 fee. I told the agent it was ridiculous to me that I would have to pay to re-instate a flight that never should have been cancelled in the first place. I was eventually offered to be transferred to a supervisor, where I was then on hold for another hour and half before the call was dropped on me. At this point, I was already in contact with the online chat and called back in to attempt again on the phone. In total, I was on hold for about six hours before the initial flight was re-instated through the online chat. I hung up the phone line, and just accepted that I at least had my initial flight re-booked. That was, at least, until I arrived at the airport and was told that there was no checked-in bag for my ticket. I was then forced to pay an additional $70 to bring the bag, I had already flown down with, back up with me to Newark. I was able to make my flight home where, upon arrival, I noted the time that I had arrived to the baggage claim gate. From that point, it took over 30 minutes for the bags to begin coming back for the fellow flight members and I. It was then the next day, and I was looking through my bank statements just to confirm everything looked correct when I found an additional $3.50 fee from Spirit Airlines for ""Onboard Irving TX"". I have never been to Texas in my life, and am now concerned about the company falsely charging me even further for things that never even happened. If not everything else that went completely wrong with these flights and the customer service between, I find immensely unacceptable that I was allowed on my flight to MCO without the company even acknowledging me on the flight. At that point, I could have been any single person allowed onto the plane without any definitive answer as to who; and I find that genuinely terrifying.

Sounds like a major security issue to me, they completely weren’t aware of a passenger being on board? Then, 2 days later when the rest of my family is at Tampa airport ready to go back to Jersey, we check our bags in (which is also a scam because the scales in the beginning of the line read my bag to be 37 pounds then when you put it on their scale they use to determine if you’re overweight, it magically went up to 41 pounds) then go to TSA. The guy at the desk tells me that my date of birth on the ticket does not add up to my ID, so he can’t let us through. We then have to go back to the transit and take that to where we originally started, just for them to tell us that the dates are all matched up and they don’t know why we were just sent back there. Third and last, while on the plane one of the stewardess was quick to demand I pull my mask up after it slipped from my nose, while hers was not even being worn. Complete waste of time and unnecessary stress after already being in a stressful environment. NO communication within workers + system errors there that will cause someone to miss their flight, and clearly very poor training which is quite worrisome being that these people are in charge of our safety.

I live in Columbus, OH and am from Orlando, FL, so to fly home conveniently, my options are limited as Columbus is a smallish airport and Spirit seems to be the only airline with a direct flight every day from Columbus to Orlando or vice versa (Allegiant and Frontier only fly certain limited days). Last week, like many, my flight from Orlando to Columbus on Spirit was cancelled. Yes, they gave us a refund, and fortunately we were able to catch a flight on a different airline, albeit 12 hours later. Spirit ""gifted"" us each (me and my dad were flying back) a $50 voucher to use on another flight. Since I travel monthly between Columbus and Orlando, I proceeded to book a one-way flight from Orlando to Columbus for next week (I go tomorrow from Columbus to Orlando on a different airline). Naturally, I chose a $43 flight home to Columbus, which ended up being about $90 due to me needing a carry-on. I thought perfect, I'll use my voucher, but of course it did not work. Annoyed by this and a message stating that this flight was ""restricted"" and I was unable to use the voucher, I called Spirit and remained on the line forever. This isn't about the money, $90 is fine for a flight, but if I have this voucher, I want to use it and since Spirit put a 12 hour wrench in my plans last week, I think its the least they could do. I finally get some poor dude on the phone and proceed to explain the situation. After giving him my voucher number, he proceeds to tell me that I cannot redeem the voucher on this trip. By this point I am totally confused as I believe I am someone who can read, and the email clearly states: ""Your voucher credit is redeemable for trips booked by the expiration date on any flight available in the system."" Now this person proceeds to tell me this flight is too low cost for the voucher to be used and that I can book on a later flight that day. Keep in mind, this flight he is suggesting is not direct, will take me like 6 hours instead of 2, and is $100 more expensive, basically rendering my voucher useless.

One told us we’d get help with a hotel, a meal voucher, and an email with a new flight. The next worker said other people were just buying new flights with different airlines and said it would be best to do that. The last worker said they were not helping at all with any hotels, had no info for any hotels around, and it’d be several hours before we received an email for a new flight.

"""customer support is horrendous""",1,2021-08-02,"I am based out of the US, and I booked an international flight using Spirit since it was much cheaper than the other major airlines, so I figured I would try them out. Outbound was delayed by six hours, but I eventually got to my destination. Delays happen, I wasn't going to post a negative review just for that. Going back to the US after my vacation was up was the major problem. Four hours before departure, I get an email from Spirit that my flight has been canceled. I didn't leave for the airport yet, so I tried to get in touch with Spirit support to see what they would do for me to help me get back to my home country. I first tried to modify my flight on their website for the next available outbound, but the page kept error'ing out. I then dialed into their 801 Utah number, but after 60 minutes on hold, dialing internationally mind you which is not inexpensive, I eventually hung up. I then messaged them on whatsapp, and got a quick auto-reply that someone would get back to me later in the day. Later in the day?! That did not sound acceptable, but there are no other options to contact Spirit. About an hour later, Spirit support messaged me back on whatsapp to say that I qualified for two options: a reservation credit with a $50 voucher, or a refund for my return flight. I reminded them that I was in an international location, about to be kicked out of my hotel room, and since Spirit canceled my flight, I asked why they could not rebook me on their next available flight. Spirit simply told me these were the only options available to me. So, Spirit completely abandoned me in a foreign country. I looked on Spirit's website for a new outbound where I could possibly use the credit, but the next available flight was now 2 days out. I asked Spirit for a refund on my return flight, which he said he would start to process. It is later in the day, so other airlines at this point do not have same day flight options. I booked another night in the hotel, have to pay to take a new COVID test as my previous one was at 3 days as of the time of my original flight, spent an hour on an international phone call which yielded me no results, and have just booked a new flight on another airline for the next day, for $1,300. I thought I would save money by using Spirit for an international flight, but after they canceled my flight and didn't bother to book me on another one, all the other expenses I am now facing completely wrecked my finances. Spirit is not on the hook for any of this. Is this even legal? Can a US based airline really just abandon you in a foreign country without any recourse?

As I waited to be rerouted, I called the Spirit line they provided to be put on the soonest flight. They indicated there was nothing for over 24 hours and I have to work on Monday (it’s Sunday). I said no I wasn’t interested and see what they airport could do. Being among the first there, I find out that the rep went behind my back and booked me for that flight the following days anyways, making my rebooking a nightmare. The phone rep was like “I can give you a refund “I’m like I don’t want a refund, I want to go home.” I was able to get rerouted home, but my flight would not be until 12 hours later, all the way in San Juan (about a 2 hour drive). For our inconvenience they sent us meal vouchers automatically and got a taxis for everyone to go to the other airport. We were sardines. No COVID protocols taken by Spirit other than masks, packing 11 people into a vehicle. We had no idea who this company was and absolutely no information. The gentleman got us to the airport, sleep deprived and all, around 3:30 am. We had 8 or so hours to wait. When I got out, I thought I grabbed everything and unfortunately did not notice I had not grabbed my purse, that had my medications, my identification, COVID vaccine card, as well as my air pods and a lot of money ; yes, shame on me. That is completely my fault. What is unforgivable is that every rep in the airport but Spirit was able to assist me in one form or another. We had no way to contact the taxi service they sent us on and they apparently had no way to contact their Aguadilla location to find out who THEY used! Desperate and in a panic as I was calling the Aguadilla office and receiving no acknowledgment, I went to the Jet Blue rep and she directed me to the Spirit line to see if they could dig up the number. The employee who assisted me was lifeless and really knew no information despite the number of times she seemed to be pretending to help. I went back to the Jet Blue line to see how they recommended to proceed, I had copies of my DL on my phone. They said I should be able to pass with it but to go to an officer and file a report so I can use as proof to board. I wasn’t giving up but I also needed to get my ducks in a row. The Jet Blue reps were very friendly and TSA even called in an officer to help assist. My mom kept look out for the van that brought us and by some miracle we were able to get in contact with the taxi driver, an hour or so later, and he came back With everything. Nothing had been moved. Spirit caused all of my issues. I would never have lost my purse if I was on the original flight instead of running around like a crazy person. I was a nervous wreck unnecessarily due to their failure to effectively communicate with their comrades and almost had a panic attack.

"""I should have known better""",1,2021-07-20,"Truly terrible. Like many other reviewers for Spirit Airlines, I should have known better. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $50 on a ticket for Jet Blue. I was flying to Orlando from Saint Thomas, and was supposed to transfer to Boston. The plane from Saint Thomas was ""diverted"" to San Juan, Puerto Rico, so they could refuel. Why they couldn't do that in Saint Thomas, I have no idea. We were joking on the plane that this is just like when you only put in a bit of fuel so you can make it to a cheaper gas station. So we were delayed in San Juan for one hour, which caused me to miss my flight to Boston. The stewardesses on the flight were reassuring me that the attendant at Orlando would be able to put me on the next available flight to Boston, even if it was with another airline. Barring that, they would at least be able to put me up in a hotel and give me dinner. Needless to say, in classic Spirit Airlines style, that did not happen. When I got to Orlando, I was told by the Spirit attendant that the refueling was due to ""weather conditions"", and so they would not only have to put me on the next Spirit airlines flight, which is 24 hours later, they would not put me in a hotel for the night. I spent an hour standing in the airport trying to not to lose it, and eventually came to the conclusion that I only had myself to blame for being out of my mind to ever even consider booking Spirit Airlines. I ended up paying out of my own pocket to get a hotel room and getting on the flight 24 hours the next day. I cannot recommend against flying Spirit airlines more. Every single flight I've ever had with Spirit has had some problem associated with it (cancelled flights, missing layovers, etc.). Truly the worst airline in America. Trust me, the $30 you save instead of booking United or America is NOT worth it. You will most likely spend more trying to compensate for Spirit Airline's terrible policies and general inadequacies. I would give this airline negative stars if possible. I am giving the flight attendants 3 stars because even though they were misinformed about their own airline's policies, I would be surprised if the company was at fault for not communicating to them correctly.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Saint Thomas to Orlando via Boston,July 2021,1,3,,1,1,,,False

"""customer service was of no service""",2,2021-07-09,"Not Verified |  My wife and I had a 12:36 flight to Nashville with a two hour delay in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The flight out of Philly was a half hour late. It had been raining in Florida, however, we landed with no problem. While taxiing to the gate, a flight attendant announced we would be waiting on the tarmac for approximately twenty-five minutes due to a plane still loading at our respective gate. Forty-five minutes later we began moving. We were scheduled for Gate F 6, The Nashville flight would be departing F 8. Instead we wound up at Gate G 12. In Fort Lauderdale G to F is one end of the airport to the other. There were twelve passengers who had to make the connecting flight to Nashville. To the credit of the flight attendants, they requested that the passengers let the twelve Nashville people off first. The twelve became about thirty. Debarking we had approximately five minutes to run through the airport. Needless to say the Nashville plane already left. There was no one at the gate to give us some insight regarding what to do. Somehow we found the was a Spirit customer service desk back at Gate G 10 - another trek through the airport, The young lady behind the desk reacted like we were bothering her. Her response, ""We could take the next Spirit flight the next day at 4:30 pm. Have a nice day."" We had a hotel in Nashville booked plus a tour booked the next morning, She said it was not the airlines fault but our fault for being on a plane waiting over forty-five minutes to find a gate. Another young lady named Devin came. At least she was more empathetic to our situation. Finally some manager arrived. He stated Spirit was not responsible for us missing the Nashville flight blaming first the weather (we had no problem landing) then blamed the airport. Finally he offered a refund if we wanted. Where do we stay? What do we do? One of the twelve found a nine-thirty Jet-Blue Nashville flight which we booked. We left Philadelphia at 12:45 pm and arrived in Nashville at 12:30 am add another half hour by the time we got to our hotel. Delays happen but it was the lack of concern by the Spirit personnel with the exception of Devin and the flight attendants.

"""by far the worst airline""",1,2021-07-08,"This airline is by far the worst airline I have ever run across in my life. I do not even know how they can be still be in business with their policies and cutting corners. I think they intentionally make it impossible to cancel or change any flight. My first experience with them started during covid, it had just started, and all flights were canceled. I canceled the flight online, but their website doesn’t work except to book flights but never to cancel them. I was told that I never canceled my flight, but I did multiple times and even sent them proof but catch this, they didn’t even fly on that day due to the shutdown policy, but they were still penalizing me for it, unbelievable. After contacting them numerous amounts of time they begrudgingly gave me credit when other airlines issued full refunds. I decided it was time to use my credit, so I bought a ticket yesterday around noon then decided two hours later to cancel the flight. Under the customer service standard set by the Department of Transportation that says airlines must let travelers hold a reservation at the quoted fare for 24 hours without payment, or allow a purchased reservation to be canceled within 24 hours without penalty and with a full refund to the original form of payment. All airlines operating to, from, and within the U.S. must comply with the 24-hour rule. The clock starts ticking on the 24 hours once the ticket purchase has been made. The only exception to note that the DOT rule does not apply in a handful of cases. The refund policy only applies to bookings made at least seven days or more before departure. But if you make a reservation less than seven days before the flight’s departure date, the 24-hour rule does not cover your booking—meaning you have no grace period to cancel and receive a full refund. My flight was ten within days to my trip, therefore I do not fall under the exception. I have been trying to contact someone for almost 24 hours now. Either I am on hold for hours or when someone picks up the connection is terrible because their customer service is another county. The specialists on WhatsApp were wonky, slow and terrible. The lady I finally spoke to said I would be charged $104 but for what? I am well within my right to cancel without penalty. She said that I needed to have booked the flight 7 days before departure which is the exact opposite of what the law states, I do not understand the level of intelligence. I do not know if she was confused or that is how they were trained to lie to customers and frustrate them while charging them illegal fees. I finally got transferred to a supervisor or manager that gave me my full refund. I should have never had to go through hell and high water to cancel my flight, I spent most of my day today and yesterday trying to resolve a situation that would have taken most airline 2 minutes or less with other major airlines.

After being in line for 1:20 mins I asked the attendant how were we going to make the flight with over 150 people stretched out past all the other airlines check in counters. THEN she proceeded to separate the line into 2 lines depending on where u were flying. 4 people held the line up for 45 mins with issues bout their flight. Mind u there was only one attendant for each line. So the line we were in got held up by the SAME 4 people. By the time their issue was resolved there was still over 50-60 people in the line needing to drop bags or check in. When we finally got our bags dropped we had 9 mins to make it through security and get to our gate!!! Everyone else behind us missed the flight due to no fault of their own. How do spirit expect to check in 275 passengers for a flight with one damn counter open? The weigh scales were all inaccurate. So most people in line thought they were good to only find out at the counter the bag was over and they need to pay more money! Nothing is free with Spirit!

Don’t be fooled by the cheaper tickets because they are going to get it through other ways like Baggage, snacks and other tactics.

The right thing to do was to open all those counters and try ur best to get those people on the flights they’ve paid for. They didn’t care because they made some money and realized they could make more. They didn’t even try to delay the plane!!

Finally I was able to get in touch with their social media representative on instagram, who was the only one I was able to have a complete conversation about the issue. They claimed that the missing credit on my account was due to the the baggage refund I was given by my credit card company. My credit card company told me they could not refund me for the flight ($203.93) because Spirit Airline already refunded me this by giving me a credit of $135.08 . They could however refund me the baggage $88 because it wasn't credited by the airline and also it was a separate service that was purchased but not used.

"""This was the last time I let Spirit rip me off""",1,2021-03-18,"You may think you're saving money by flying with Spirit, and you may think that by bringing a small backpack you will save even more rather than paying their exorbitantly overpriced baggage fees, but it's entirely up to the gate agent to decide whether or not they want to charge you $65 as you're boarding your flight. This happened to me and many others that were in line to have our tickets scanned as we were boarding. This agent just pulled all of us out of line, and even though most bags fit within their 'guideline' box, she still had us all line up at the counter and without telling us what was happening, each one of us had to give our credit cards to pay so we could board the flight. I do not believe it is acceptable to fluster and scare your customers into thinking that they will miss their flight if they don’t immediately comply with a demand to pay as they are boarding their flight. Customer service experience was even worse as they seem to continuously provide you with the same generic template that claims ""I’m afraid I'm unable to verify what bag you had at the time of travel and its dimensions"" so they will take the agent's word over yours even if you provide photos.

I had my mask on the entire flight but someone beside me was eating a candy bar and the flight attendant told him to take a bite and chew with his mask on but she didn’t politely tell or ask him to do so she screamed at him in front of all the other passengers and he was humiliated.

There were crumbs all in my seat and on the floor, it was truly unbelievable and here’s the best part, the person that was with me on the flight wrote a review talking about how bad Spirit Airlines really is and Spirit sent her an email saying she was on the airlines no fly list because she spoke negatively about them.

However, our daughter is unable to wear a mask due to her low grade autism disorder and other medical conditions. They told us if she cannot wear a mask, they will have to cancel this flight and put us on a different flight. We didn’t agree with that logic because it didn’t make sense to us. Why would she magically decide to wear a mask on the next flight if she can't wear a mask on this one? We asked them if she can use a pacifier in place of a mask but they refused. We tried to put a mask on our baby but she was crying and rolling on the floor covering her mouth and screaming no mask mommy, no mask. Everyone on the flight watched the drama unfold and the flight crew did nothing but scoff at the idea that a 2 year old can't wear a mask! The flight attendant displayed disgusting behavior. They subsequently let a 4 year old go inside the flight without a mask. If they honestly cared about public safety, why are they completely packing all of their flights? ALL other airlines close the middle row in between passengers but Spirit packs everyone in their planes like sardines and then expects everyone to be safe? What happened to social distancing? If they cared so much about my daughter wearing a mask they should ban all travel for children who cannot wear masks, including infants! They can exhale contaminated air just like adults, no?

Spirit airlines was a sardine can. They did not take anyones temperature, nor did they wipe down seats or have sanitizer anywhere. Three people that I saw on the plane did not wear masks and that seemed fine with the airline. On the website they say they have implemented covid regulations but that is not true. They also have an erroneous number on their website (801) 401-2222, should you try to contact them it is out of order and apparently they do not know it and still list it. Do they have anyone the regulates their covid operations? We all live in Los Angeles which is a police state as far as the pandemic is concerned, yet they allow Spirit Airlines to have no restrictions at all. I wish the governor could see this flight I was on - he'd be disgusted and hopefully slap them with a fine. If I don't get Covid after taking this flight then I must have the best immunity system in the world. It is literally a petrie dish of infection and they don't seem to care. They need regulation so that they make it safe for their passengers during this pandemic. I don't think they are aware or care that there is a pandemic, they are just selling cheap flights. Also the flight is the worst ever - crammed in, no wifi, movies or any food but that is not what bothered me it was the lack of concern over covid.

I submitted them again. They didn't respond until after it was too late to get on my flight.

"""They made our family feel unsafe""",1,2020-10-09,"Not Verified |  During our flight, there was a passenger that never wore a mask, not at any time on the flight. Repeatedly, the flight crew served this man 3 alcoholic beverages. They had ample opportunity to address the fact that he was not wearing a mask with him, and could have denied him the ability to purchase alcohol. Instead, they served him 3x. My issue is not with the serving of the alcohol, but rather that there was not a single person on the crew that stood up and made the man wear a mask, nor took any other measures about it. Passengers all around us were commenting on the fact that this passenger was not wearing a mask. No one felt safe. An older Air Force Veteran was seated directly in front of the passenger and asked that he put on a mask. The passenger said ""What's your problem? You believe all this bullshit?"" Furthermore, I witnessed the passenger go to the bathroom in the back of the plane 3x where the other flight crew was sitting in unoccupied seats. They didn't say a thing to him. They laughed with him when he passed as he took his long beard and covered his face (laughing) and they joined in the fun. Are you kidding me? You openly laugh with a passenger without a mask on and watch him go to the bathroom 3x and do absolutely nothing. We were travelling with my children, one of which is too young to wear a mask at only 16 months old. How is it okay, how is it safe for us to fly? They promised us as a company that their standard was to require masks to be worn. No exceptions. Yet they don't. After the flight, as we were disembarking, I said to one of the flight crew, ""How could you be so complicit as to let that man not wear a mask the entire flight?"" to which her response was ""He had one on and would take it off. What could I do about it?"". He did not have one on. Not at any point. Not when he went to the bathroom, not when he sat in his seat, not when he stood up before the plane was even done taxing (not once, not twice, but three times), nothing. How does your Flight Crew have NO answer to a passenger that won't put on a mask? Delta is openly banning passengers like this from ever flying again and, on record, has landed planes in flight to address people like this to show a firm hand, severe consequences.

As COVID-19 started to shut down more events, we realized that the cheer competition would not be rescheduled. And, the government was asking airlines to refund travel. Several parents said that they called Spirit and received refunds after the initial cancelation of their flights. One of my friends told me she called this morning, so I decided to call and ask for a refund. She said that the process was simple. She stated that she wasn't given any hassle & it was a good experience. When I called, the representative told me that he was unable to process a refund on the phone, but I could receive a refund if I went online and requested it. I told him that I had a friend that called this morning & she was refunded over the phone. He told me he could not help me, so I asked him to transfer me to someone who may be able to. He transferred me to his supervisor, who proceeded to tell me that I wasn't warranted a refund at all & that he could give me an additional $50.00 on my voucher. I told him that the other representative told me I could get a refund online & he told me that wasn't true. So, the first person told me I could get a refund, but they weren't able to do it. And, his supervisor told me that a refund wasn't authorized at all. I told him about the friend I mentioned above and told him a voucher didn't do me any good because I am not an airline traveler. He hung up on me. This was 17 minutes of conversation. I called back & talked with Zamie. She told me that the supervisor put notes in the system that he was ""disconnected"". No, he clearly hung up when I asked him about why they issued refunds to other individuals. I gave her both reservation numbers and full names. She looked them up & verfied their refunds. After 53 minutes on the line with Zamie, she told me that she wasn't able to issue a refund either, because ""I"" canceled my flight .. not Spirit. I told her that the other two individuals did the exact same thing that I had done. And, I was following the same protocol. So, I was curious why I wasn't warranted the same refund that Spirit gave to other customers. We had the same flight to the same location & all of us canceled online and received vouchers. Once I told her I had received an email from Spirit that my flight was canceled, she put me on hold & issued the refund. So, I spent an hour & ten minutes this morning talking with people that told me I wasn't authorized a refund & finally gave me a refund. I understand that there are guidelines & rules in place. But, in times like these understanding goes a long way. And, I would understand if the answer was ""no, vouchers only"" to every single traveler. But, I personally knew of 2 different families that received refunds & I was being denied one under the same circumstances. Zamie was helpful, but her hands were tied. Nonetheless, I am very disappointed in Spirit Airlines. My husband is a retired Marine of 30 years & I served 5 years in the Air Force. I wasn't asking for something that was impossible. I was asking for the same service other people were given. I am hoping that other customers aren't having to jump through the same hoops I had to catapult myself through. People are out of jobs. People are scared. I truly hope that my refund was processed & I will get my money.",False,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Charleston, WV to Orlando, FL",April 2020,,,,,1,,,False

"""snag you with extra fees""",3,2020-03-10,"Not Verified |  Newark to Ft Lauderdale. Buyer beware as you navigate online booking. The website is designed to snag you with extra fees and sales. My first hand experience trying to redeem a credit to apply to another flight has also been designed to have me give up and eat the $58. I received a txt msg asking me to “bid” on the voucher. Bid? The link from the txt sent me to online customer service FAQs which explained that receipt of all vouchers or credits must be done by phone with customer service. After 30 minutes hold time they hung up (twice) Now trying customer service by txt msg out of desperation, crickets even after 45 minutes!",False,A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Ft Lauderdale,March 2020,3,5,,4,2,,,False
"""staff was absolutely unprofessional""",1,2020-03-09,"Tampa to Las Vegas. This is now the 2nd time Spirit has cancelled a flight without proper notice. 1st time we were delayed almost 4 hours due to a crew shortage which they verbally announced over the loud speaker. After 4 hours, they ultimately cancelled the flight stating 'inclement weather' being the reason so they didn't have to compensate for their error. No offer to book hotels, supply ubers for this flight of almost 200 people. I missed a job interview because of this mishap and I had to practically stalk them for a partial refund. All the while, the staff was absolutely unprofessional, almost downright hateful towards all the passengers trying to rebook. Against my better judgement, I booked again trying to save a few bucks. Not even an hour before take off, I get an email that the flight was cancelled with no reason given. I am writing this review in hopes it will deter people from booking with this airline because the stress they cause is not worth the money 'you save'.

"""would not recommend to anyone""",1,2020-03-07,"Newark to Houston. I am horrified with the treatment received on Spirit airlines. Traveling on Spirit airlines flight NK 703 from Newark to Houston on March 5, 2020, I encountered a very rude/unprofessional air hostess. There were at least 5 other victims of her horrible behavior. Despite being at least 20% empty seats, she would not allow any of these people to change their seats and if they did, she scolded them in a very demeaning manner. Despite being empty bins, she did not allow people to put their backpacks, coats, etc. and asked people with an attitude and mean manners to remove and keep their bags under their seats. I was in a row with 2 other heavy build elderly passengers. The lady next to me was not very cooperative and was encroaching my seat by removing the hand-rest between our seats. I was uncomfortable with her behavior. It is very uncomfortable to travel about 4 hours in such a situation, so I asked to go to a seat behind me, but the same air hostess did not allow me with belittling comments, telling that she does it only for certain people. She scolded and asked me to return to my seat. I asked her that she just told the other passenger that he could only move one row ahead or behind and I am asking to move just one seat behind then why I cannot? She told me that this was an order on behalf of Captain, asserting her authority unnecessarily in a rude manner. There was no need to invoke Captain's authority for such a simple issue. Two rows behind me (#23 and #24) were completely unoccupied (12 vacant seats). Also, she displayed a very cheap and unethical behavior – she tried to instigate the women next to me to falsely accuse me who strongly denied to her (Air hostesses’) pleading. I will never again fly with Spirit and would not recommend to anyone.",True,,Business,Economy Class,Newark to Houston,March 2020,1,1,,3,2,,,False
"""never fly this airline again""",1,2020-03-07,"Tampa to Las Vegas. I have worked in customer service so I understand policies and procedures but being intentionally mistreated for no apparent reason is just unacceptable. The experience I had with Spirit airlines this past weekend were so far beyond terrible. My husband, myself and both of our families have traveled with different airlines for years and were shocked with the way we were treated. The worst airline I have ever encountered. We were heading to Las Vegas for my sister-in-law's wedding, we decided to check if we were able to change our flight to a day earlier for extra time. The woman on the on the phone would huff and puff so we could literally hear it. She was so annoyed that we wanted to modify our flight. So once we get to the airport, we confirmed that we paid extra for the seats with extra leg room. Once we made our way through security and were at the boarding counter, we noticed our boarding passes did not have the seats we requested to which they stated they ""didn't know what happened"" but although we paid, we did not get those seats. At this time we asked if a refund was available and were laughed at. We were not very happy about the situation flying to Las Vegas but just brushed it off. After a wonderful vacation, we arrived at the airport to head home. Our flight home was absolutely horrible. I have never been treated so poorly by staff in my life. We had asked at the desk to check in our bags what all needed to be checked, carry on, etc. they stated the two suit cases we would check and we each had 1 personal item with no charge. Once we got in line to board the plane we were stopped and asked about our bags. We had explained that we asked and were told we could carry what we had on for no charge .. they ended up giving us such a hard time, we had to pay for bags that we were able to bring for free on our flight which was obviously frustrating. One of the girls at the boarding counter looked me up and down several times and proceeded to intimidate me by staring at me and whispering to the other staff members. They kept threatening that they would take us off our flight because we were questioning why we had to pay again. They made us feel like low life, trashy people. Once we were finally able to board the plane, the woman flight attendant grabbed my husbands arm and told him ""we better not have any issues on this flight"" as we walked to our seats. She then proceeded to stop at our row every 2 seconds to tell me to push my bag under the seat .. it was completely under the seat, I hadn't touched the bag since we sat down. We then spent our entire overnight flight, being the only row with the over head lights stuck on. Not only have we been hung up on over the phone multiple times, we have been so mistreated, we will never fly this airline again. I would rather walk than take a flight with rude staff, uncomfortable seats, no wifi, missing half the food and drinks on the menu, etc.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Las Vegas,February 2020,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,1,False
"""seats are really only two hour seats""",7,2020-03-05,"We had two perfect flights on Spirit. Outbound left 5 minutes late and return left 5 minutes early. A couple of things I learned. First, as crazy as the baggage policy is, you can see the true impact on boarding and deplaning. With so few carry ons, boarding goes really fast. Their A320 has the widest aisle of any airplane I have been on. There were absolutely no issues and no drama in either Baltimore or Tampa. In fact, the airport staff and airline staff were all friendly and helpful. Now the seats are really only ""two hour"" seats. After two hours you'd rather be sitting anywhere else. The tray table is the smallest on any airline I have flown. There is enough room for a drink and a phone and nothing else. The seatback pocket consists of two bungee cords crisscrossed. My guess is it was deliberately done to prevent you from storing anything in there. And the seats themselves are remarkably uncomfortable. The padding is probably an inch thick. They have a weird curvature to them. But there is a reasonable amount of legroom. If you are a large person (wide), then the width may be an issue for you. If you fly for a living and are used to more perks (food, boarding, front row seats, free bags, etc>) then this airline is definitely not for you. If you are traveling light, want a cheap price, and can tolerate an uncomfortable seat for a few hours then this airline may work for you. In our case, we knew about the baggage costs, thought we knew about the seats (you can't until you sit in them), and heard all the negative comments posted here and still went ahead with the booking. Everything worked out fine. The price + the baggage + the seats was still cheaper than Southwest. Everything worked out fine for us. If you read all the comments on here, you would think they never take off on time. Know the pricing of amenities before you go, Know the carry on size limitation. You are flying a discount airline. They discount the price by saving in other areas. If that works for you, then do it. If you are the type that gets upset when they charge for water onboard, don't do it. It does seem like connecting flights may be an issue. In our case we flew nonstop. For two hours or less, I would do it again. For anything over that, I would really have to be sucked in by the price.",True,A320,Business,Economy Class,Baltimore to Tampa,March 2020,1,3,,5,4,,,True
