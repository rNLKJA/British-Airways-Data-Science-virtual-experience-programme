"""not ignore the mistreatment""",4,2019-01-27,"On 26th December I took a flight from Toronto with connecting flights in Porta Del Gado and Lisbon and a final destination of Seville, Spain. Unfortunately the Azores flight from Ponta Del Gado to Lisbon was delayed due to operational technicalities within the Lisbon airport, backing up the airport for most of the day. As a result I arrived in Lisbon minutes before the initial scheduled boarding for my next TAP flight was set to take place, fearful that I would miss it. I received a text message to my phone from Azores Airlines stating that my next flight had been delayed itself over one hour, however, given the timing, I was still cutting it close. Upon arriving at my TAP boarding gate I was made aware that the flight I was set to take next was indeed delayed two hours itself, meaning that I had made it in time and would be able to fly out shortly. After getting to the front of the line awaiting to board, the TAP attendant told me, quite matter of factly, that my ticket had been sold due to my past flights delay, and that my next flight would not be for another 10 hours. Naturally I was shocked, and disappointed not only to spend 10 additional hours in the airport, but for the fact that my plans made in Spain would not take place, losing an entire day of travel. Upon pleading with the attendee she told me that it wasn't her dilemma, offering no consolation and asking me to take it up with the Azores officials, as it was not a TAP issue that my ticket was given away. I then tracked down the Azores customer service department. They told me they were sorry for what had happened, however there was nothing they could do, seemingly confused with the events that had taken place. The representative told me all they could offer me at that moment was two 10 Euro vouchers for lunch and dinner at the airport. I found this an incredible lack of compensation given the loss of a day of travel, 10 hours spent in an airport, as well as no prior communication as to my ticket being sold. After inquiring about my luggage, it was only after my question that she explained to me they had no track on its whereabouts. I was then forced with the task of lining up for nearly an hour to find my luggage from the lost and found, and lining up again to check my bags for my next flight. The next several hours were as one could expect. Not the ideal setting for the first day of one's holiday. The lack of adequate customer service, the lack of communication, as well as the lack of compensation is astounding in my eyes. The fact that I wasn’t made aware of this decision the airline had made for me, especially after receiving a text message previously with an update, is astounding. I cannot believe how I was treated between the two airlines on this day. Compensation in the form of two meal vouchers for a loss of a day of travel, poor service and 10 additional hours in an airport is comical. I have never voiced a formal complaint in this manner, however, given these circumstances I simply could not ignore the mistreatment. I am a frequent flyer and often travel to Europe.

Recently I flew on a leased A340 aircraft operated by a Spanish airline called Plus Ultra Airlines for SATA. The flight was from Lisbon to Ponta Delgada and then the aircraft was continuing on to Toronto. Thankfully, my final destination was Ponta Delgada, and I didn't need to continue on the what would have been a long and horrible journey to Toronto. The flight was delayed which is no surprise since I have never seen a flight of SATA depart on schedule. Whilst onboard we were given no briefing by the flight crew why the flight was delayed. We stayed at our stand for almost an hour. As a frequent flyer this aircraft was the worst aircraft I have ever been on. It was very dirty, and didn't look like it had been cleaned for a long time. Parts of the interior were very deteriorated and almost falling apart. The inflight entertainment remotes were falling out of their place exposing the wires or had parts broken off it. The tables needed force to take out and put them back in. The bathroom was very dirty. The crew were not helpful at all.

We stood in line for over 5 hours to be rebooked with only 2 junior counter people who were inexperienced requiring them to call a supervisor by phone for codes in order to alter the passengers tickets while 2 other senior agents hide at a check-in counter, refusing to help anyone except the few who sweet-talked them into changing their flight, of which they refused to do for me. Not knowing my wife was with me they changed her tickets also, choosing, in secret whom they would help. This is no exaggeration. After the first 2 hours, only the first 2 people left the counter with altered flights (again because the agents obviously didn't know how to make the alterations). Paperwork was required for reimbursements (2-page form, 1 per passenger, 5 in my case, wife, and kids). After the first 2 hours passed we asked the counter to pass the paperwork out the the group so that we could start filling it out in line. They refused at first and after the repeated request by very agitated passengers did they start to pass out the forms as it was creating a bottleneck at the counter, but then refused to give out pens. People began buying pens at the gift shop next to the ticket counter. Again after 1 hour of refusing to give out pens (an obvious premium at SATA) they then found a box of pens to hand out (the 3rd hour in). There was no communication, no advisement. They expected stranded passengers to figure out what to do and where to go, there were 3 different lines, no guidance, SATA employees scattered from the terminal check-in area. Passengers where left to get information from each other, often conflicting. Complete confusion. There were families with children, who became desperate without access to baggage (another completely ridiculous story), many crying over the stress of the long day (7:30am check-in to 9:30 PM before everyone was served, my self last as I gave my place inline to an elderly couple who lost their place in line after they had to sit after 3 hours in line (other passengers were so desperate they refused to let them back in line where they were, that is how desperate everyone became at a certain point). Please choose another destination as the SATA staff in Terceira (and the other islands for that matter) is not capable of servicing tourist. They do not have the experience, the staff, or planes to properly handle cancelations. Their staff have a sense of entitlement and lack the sensitivity required to care and have the patience to help clients.

"""airline gets worse every year""",1,2018-08-15,"Boston to Terceira. This airline gets worse every year. They essentially have the monopoly in the Azores, as far as routes and usually pricing, meaning they don't care how poorly they treat customers. I have often had them tell me there are no flights available, only to arrive at the airport to see the exact flight I wanted only half full. I have flown close to 100 times, and almost a dozen times with SATA, and I have never been asked to weigh my carry-on bags. Any other airline doesn't generally care, as long as it fits. On 12 August, we were on a flight that was less than half full, on a large A321 with plenty of overhead and cabin space. I assume because they wanted to make some extra bang for their buck, they stopped every single person at the boarding pass counter and made them weigh every carry on. If you wanted to keep it, you had to pay $100 to check it, whether it had medications or anything. The average weight of just a carry on bag alone is 9 lbs, meaning virtually no carry on will ever be light enough to be under 17 lbs. SATA has a tendency to underbook flights and delay or cancel a lot, but why they decide to gouge everyone again at the counter is beyond me. This aircraft was also utterly filthy, as when we opened our tray tables they were covered in an unknown sticky substance. I would love to tell you to never book with SATA, but sometimes you don't have a choice.

Unfortunately the plane was cancelled. We were given no reason why, just a letter to email SATA with questions. (No phone number was provided and when we asked the employee behind the counter she repeatedly told us to email customer service. The flight was not rescheduled until January 19, 2018, two full days later. This left us holding the bag for a hotel and rental car on Faial which had been pre-paid and we missed out on. We also had taxis, food, etc. in Boston while we were waiting to find out if our flight was going to be rescheduled. (Not to mention that the Azores in January is 50-60 degrees, while Boston was around 30 degrees! We were not packed appropriately at all and had to purchase additional clothing to compensate for the differing climates.) Since that time, I have sent numerous emails and Facebook messages to SATA. Their response, after months of emails to the customer care email are two-fold. One: “The contract that is made with the Airline Company, only contemplates the passengers transportation until the final destination. The reasons for which someone travels from one point to the other are unknown to the airline company, therefore, we can neither be held responsible when a passenger fails to show at a scheduled location, nor when other contracts are made with other entities.”  Our flights were booked through a travel agent but they are all with SATA. So SATA does know we were flying on to Faial; we were on their flight. And, moreover, they re-booked us through to Faial two days after our originally scheduled departure. Two, after months of asking for reimbursement: “If you have any expenses regarding any meals you had to make during that waiting, please send them together with your bank details information (account holder, name of bank, address of bank, account number, bic/swift code, routing) for their analysis and eventual reimbursement according to SATAs regulation.” Of course I have had no acknowledgement that they even received my email, or follow-up emails. To top things off, when they did rebook us, the airplane was decrepit. The heating/cooling system didn’t work. The seats were the smallest, most uncomfortable things ever. And the flight attendants were rude. My family and I had flown SATA in the past and had no issues. However, after this total lack of, and disregard for, customer service, I will most likely be flying TAP Portugal. I understand things happen.

I waited for almost another hour at the gate and the departure time kept on being pushed back with no announcements. Eventually, the plane started boarding and only after passing the gate as passengers were walking onto the plane, a manager was standing there and informing passengers that the flight (which was advertised and sold as a direct flight from Toronto to Lisbon) would be making a stop in Punta Delgada in the Azores. There was no explanation or apology and when I told him that this would be unacceptable he simply told me that I could get off the flight if I preferred. Extremely rude. In the end, the flight that stopped in Punta Delgada for an hour to pick up passengers there. We were told at one point by cabin crew that this was because there were passengers that were stranded there. But when I asked the passengers that got on the flight, they said that they were not stranded at all. They were getting on the flight at the right time and had bought their tickets months in advance. What became quite clear was that the airline basically decided to divert the direct flight and pass-through Punta Delgada to make use of the empty seats on the flight and fill it up, not caring at all about the inconvenience of hundreds of passengers on board. As a result, my flight arrived in Lisbon 3 hours and 15 minutes late. Not only were we not offered any sort of compensation for this, we were not even offered a simple apology. I should add that the food service was absolutely terrible and the quality of the meals served was poor. Upon researching this SATA after this experience, I see that it has been rated the worst for customer satisfaction, and I can now fully understand why.

I wanted to fly in business class, but since we had legs of our trip with no business class availability, their web system could not handle the request. There were only 4 seats left for our international legs on the day we were ready to buy (several months in advance of the trip), so I booked through a re-seller (SATA's Toronto office hours are not great on weekends).

Bought the economy seats for all flights (Toronto to Ponta Delgada to Gran Canaria via Madeira return with a short stop in PD). When I attempted to upgrade our international legs (Toronto to Ponta Delgada return) I was given a price about 50% higher than the business class premium should have been. Eventually one staff member told me that the upgrade now included a fee for changes. The only remedy they offered was for me to check on flight days to see if there were any upgrades available. Of course there were not. (In fact the only response I got in Toronto was a condescending smirk.) I tried contacting customer service and appealing to the logic of other representatives with no good result. I understand penalties for changing dates or downgrading seats, but they should really rethink policies that prevent a passenger from upgrading reasonably. I am unlikely to use the airline again because of this policy. As for the flights - they were on time, or within reason with no threat of missing connections. Flight attendants were pleasant. The food and drinks were not great, but always provided. No hot drinks on short flights; complimentary wine with meals only. There is no on-board entertainment or USB plug ins.

"""inconsistent service with this airline""",4,2016-08-18,"✅ Verified Review | I made a round trip with SATA Air Azores from Lisbon to Ponta Delgada. The Blue lounge in Lisbon is nothing to write home about. First of all its located on the other side of the airport from where the SATA flights depart. Second the lounge was dirty. Not a good first impression when you fly business class. The flight to Ponta Delgada continues onward to Boston and boarding was quite chaotic. Boarding was announced and we had to make 2 queues which everybody did. There is no priority boarding with this airline. After the announcement nothing happened for 30 minutes and all out of sudden the announcement was made that passengers for Ponta Delgada should be standing in the right row and passengers for Boston should be standing in the left row so everybody had to switch positions again. After scanning the boarding passes it was down on the stairs were everybody had to wait for another 20 minutes before the busses arrived. After the ride to the remote stand we had to wait again for 15 minutes on the bus because the aircraft was not ready yet. During boarding there was no welcome from the crew. It seems they were too busy chit chatting with each other. The flight departed an hour late from scheduled departure time. The aircraft was clean but looked a bit outdated from the inside, strange since this aircraft is very new to their fleet. Food was very good. However the entertainment system is not working. After lunch I wanted to relax a little and decided to recline my seat (2K) which did not work. After notifying the crew that my seat was broken I was told: ""It's just a short flight!"" and that was it. Not a great attitude towards a business class passenger. On the way back to Lisbon it was a better experience. The lounge at Ponta Delgada airport is small but it's just a tiny airport so no problem. There were some fresh fruits, cookies, crackers, nuts and sufficient drinks in the lounge. The flight to Lisbon on the A320 departed on time this time. A friendly welcome from the crew and I settled into my seat. No real business class seats on the A320 but a standard economy seat with the middle seat blocked. Service on this flight was good. The crew was interested if I liked my stay on the Azores. Food on this flight was not so great. We got a very dry samosa with some vegetables and potatoes which were cold and very salty.

"""lost its way in customer service""",2,2016-08-15,✅ Verified Review |  Horta to London Heathrow via Lisbon. A lack of customer care and support left us frustrated at Lisbon. Technical issues with the Horta to Lisbon flight meant that we were just in time to board our scheduled connection to London. Our luggage was not - it hadn't been deplaned from the Horta flight. We were given two choices - board the connection now and the luggage might follow today - or tomorrow and it was our responsibility to collect from London Heathrow. Or wait for the next flight three hours later. No choice then as no one wants to be separated from their luggage at Heathrow. I accept that flights can be delayed but the complete lack of ground support from SATA for travelers with connecting flights (even under code share) is unforgiveable. From other reviews it looks like a nice little airline has lost its way in customer service and support.

So that I arrived around 1:00 a.m. instead of 5:45 pm, and no other means to go further to my home city 60 km away. Thanks to SATA, I arrived in Toulouse with 7 hours delay. SATA gave me just a 10€ voucher for a dinner at Lisbon airport, not even for a drink. The food onboard was quite uneatable. The ground staff was apparently not involved in what would happen to me after this delay, it seemed it was not their problem.

When we left Ponta Delgada to return to Boston, the flight was an hour late leaving, making me miss my flight back home to Phoenix. They spent the time busing us all from the gate to the plane, even though they made us walk the distance when we first arrived, and that process was slow and unorganized. I have never seen such a disorganized airline, even in Boston, they don't have lanes to line up in, so everyone crowds the doorway, making it impossible for the people who are supposed to be boarding to board. This happened on all flights, very disorganized and no semblance of order for the passengers. The video and entertainment systems did not work on any of the flights, either.

It would have made more sense to serve a breakfast, since the flight landed at 7 am. The chairs on the side of the airplane reclined a lot, which was my biggest complaint.

An email was sent to us at 4:30pm that day - 90 minutes after the original departure time - informing us of a substantial delay. Instead of leaving PDL at 8:15pm, as stated in the timely message, we ended up staying in the airport until 11pm - 8 hours after the original departure time. This forced us to stay an extra night in Boston and lose our connecting flight to NYC. We got to our hotel in Boston with a crying 5-month old baby at 2:30am on June 17th.

We were a little hesitant to fly SATA originally after reading all the reviews but our flight from Toronto to Ponta Delgada was one of the best flying experiences we've had a long time. It was a red eye flight leaving Toronto at 9.55pm in the evening. I must admit at first we were a little worried when we were still waiting at the gates at 9.30pm with no sign of any ground crew. However no less than 5 minutes later the ground staff showed up and began boarding passengers very quickly and efficiently. By around 10pm we were all boarded and the flight left the gate. It was actually pretty amazing they managed to board everyone in 15 minutes and still left on-time unlike many of our Air Canada experiences. The flight arrived to Ponta Delgada as scheduled and during the flight we had two drink services a meal a snack and hot towel service. The flight is less than 6 hours so they actually packed in a lot of value for the duration of the flight (and especially considering how little of anything airlines offer these days). Sure they didn't have an in-seat movie selection but it was a red eye flight so we slept for the most part. The flight attendants were well-groomed and very professional.

It is their policy to reimburse passengers after they have finished the final clear up but unfortunately we were not told this and I had the embarrassment of having to request my change from E10 as I eventually concluded it must have been an oversight. Rather expensive flights especially internally. However there is no option as I understand that they have an agreed fare tariff with TAP! It seems that pets are not allowed to travel from the UK.

No reason was ever given for the 4 hour delay (weather was perfect) however upon talking to other passengers I found out it was due to mechanical difficulties of the scheduled plane and a substitute plane had to be sent out. Adding insult to injury no attempt to give us food vouchers was made. The last hour before departure the SATA staff dragged out a few cases of warm soda bags of chips and cookies. On the return flight to Logan (#4231) I had requested a window seat instead what I got was a center seat. The overhead air vents were broken and the cabin temperature was very warm. I alerted the flight attendants twice about these conditions and their response was that we cannot repair the vents now as the plane was in flight.

On the plus side SATA did safely deliver us relatively on time to our destinations both flights. The vintage circa 1983 Airbus 310 added some adventure. Unfortunately it also added a lot of discomfort. The plane was extremely cramped and hot with bad seats no inflight entertainment systems and perhaps the worst food in an industry known for bad food. What was most impressive was the absolute disdain by which SATA staff treated the passengers. I'm pretty convinced they learned to be this way through training as there's no way so many staff in two separate cities and on one of the two flights could all be this way.

This might be fine for a 2 hour flight but a flight that is almost 5 hours? It's inhuman. The food was some kind of boiled slop with mystery seafood at the bottom. I've never been picky about airline food but this was disgusting. Most people just ate the roll and left the rest. Lack of personal space made it almost impossible to actually eat.

The crew were very friendly and helpful. A passenger was unwell during the flight and the stewardess was very caring bringing extra drinks cold towels and checked how she was feeling every so often. The flight was approximately three quarters full. The small complimentary baguette tasted nicer than it looked and there was a chocolate bar with tea and coffee. In addition to this there was two rounds of soft drinks water apple juice orange juice etc all complimentary. Alcoholic drinks were available for a charge. The outbound flight was direct but the return flight was via Manchester. The flight left on time just after 1pm and we arrived in Manchester 10 mins early. Flight was very smooth with the same complimentary drinks and sandwiches as the outbound flight. Cabin crew were friendly and very professional. When we landed in Manchester Airport there was some confusion. We knew before hand that we had to disembark the aircraft at Manchester. Some of the passengers were unaware of this and the crew only mentioned that the Gatwick passengers had to disembark when we landed. When the cabin doors opened all of the passengers for Manchester and Gatwick stood up and the crew announced that the Gatwick passengers should sit down to let the Manchester passengers disembark first. If the crew told us this before hand it would have made life much easier. The Gatwick passengers eventually disembarked (with lots of moans and groans) and the passengers were given an in transit boarding card. Gatwick passengers had to take all of their hand luggage to the security check point have the bags scanned and then board the same plane back to Gatwick. The whole process was ridiculous but apparently this is due to UK immigration not SATAs fault. We departed Manchester on the same aircraft 1hr later for the 35 mins flight to Gatwick. We arrived in Gatwick over 20 mins early. Overall very impressed with SATA. Modern aircraft excellent timekeeping with a friendly and professional crew. I will definitely fly with them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
SATA Air Azores customer review,7,2011-06-29,Boston-PTA Delgada-Boston. Boarding process quite good. Flights left on time. Very attentive cabin crews. Food decent. All in all flights very good. My only complaint is with the US reservation office. Chaotic at best. They do not communicate very well. Don't bother emailing you get no response.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
SATA Air Azores customer review,,2011-02-08,I had a flight from Toronto to Porto with a stop at Ponta Delegana. The flight was scheduled to leave at 10pm. Before leaving the house I decided to go online and check the departure times to make sure it wasn't delayed. It was delayed 2 hours - after I had got ready to leave again checked online again and it was delayed to 2pm the following day. This enraged me as I was paying for my rented car as I was still in Toronto. The following day it was delayed again to 3. I called Sata and it turns out that they divided the Ponta Delegana flight with the Porto flight. This meant that I would be going on a Lisbon airport the day after at 6am. It's not the first time of Sata doing this either.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
SATA Air Azores customer review,9,2010-11-10,Toronto to Porto then Lisbon to Ponta Delgada and Ponta Delgada to Toronto. All three flights left and arrived within a few minutes of scheduled times and flight crews were very courteous. Meals as good as any other airlines and wine was probably better. The aircraft were clean and appeared to be well maintained. They had movies during the flight but the plane had the old style drop down TVs. The only real complaint was the flight from Lisbon to Ponta Delgada was originally scheduled for 1250 but was changed to 1630 without anyone notifying us - even though we had provided both cell phone numbers and email. As a result we had to sit around the Lisbon airport for an extra three hours. The seats are also very close together and don't provide a lot of legroom for a long flight. Otherwise everything else was great and we are planning to travel with SATA again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
SATA Air Azores customer review,4,2010-07-07,Toronto to Ponta Delgada and back and flight was exceptional. Service on board was good staff polite. Economy food was okay but I bring my own food anyway. The interior seemed a bit dated legroom was good and there were tv's with movies.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
SATA Air Azores customer review,2,2010-06-07,Manchester to Ponta Delgado on San Miguel in the Azores. Got no food or drink for about 3 hours (around 22.00). Had to get off in Gatwick for 1.5 hours while the plane was being cleaned and food put on. Baggage lost for 3 days for self and friend. Trying to get compensation. They won't accept receipts unless the item is named. Now I have to search for the Iban code and BIC/Swift code before we can receive anything. Another member of our crew lost his baggage the next day and 30 other bags had been lost at the same time!,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
SATA Air Azores customer review,4,2010-05-16,Manchester-Ponta Delgada return avoiding dust situation fortunately. Preferable in-flight service to most crew pleasant meal and wine agreeable. Most satisfied - would look forward to further flights SATA Azores.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
SATA Air Azores customer review,5,2010-04-25,We recently travelled to Sao Miguel with 10 members of my family and had a good flight there from the UK. Unfortunately we couldn't fly back to the UK as planned due to the volcanic eruption in Iceland. SATA booked us all into a hotel and provided meals for 5 days at their expense until we could be repatriated. A First class service! Well done.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
SATA Air Azores customer review,1,2009-06-16,Boston to Azores was on time and a fine flight but the way back was a disaster. Our flight was supposed to take off at 5:45 got delayed to 7:45 delayed again until 8:30 and we finally took off round 10:30pm. This was not due to weather or any unforeseen circumstances it was all SATA's doing. The flight was half full so we think they were trying to get another feeder flight into the flight from Lisbon to make the flight more profitable. Apparently the same thing happened to the flight earlier in the week. They covered dinner at the Ponta Delgada Airport which was nice but they did not cover anything else. We missed our connection in Boston had to stay overnight (at our own cost) and pay higher fees for new tickets the next morning. They said that is was not their policy to cover any other travel issues for any of their customers even if the issues were caused by SATA. Interesting that they promised to upgrade us to Business Class if it was available but when the time came they said they could not - even though seats were available. They said that there were not enough Business Class dinners and as a result they could not let anyone sit in those seats (even if the passengers didn't care to have dinner or were OK with a Coach Class dinner). We were both surprised and astonished but could do nothing since they are the only carrier that goes to the Azores. We will try to avoid this airline at all costs. You should do the same they clearly do not understand the meaning of basic customer service.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
SATA Air Azores customer review,4,2009-06-04,Boston to Lisbon and back. The flights were on time. Pleasant crew and food great. Felt very relaxed all the way. The price is the best you could find for this time of the year. I would recommend SATA airlines.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
SATA Air Azores customer review,4,2009-05-31,SATA have just reduced their two weekly flights from London to PDL to one per week from June 2009 and will not be offering Winter 2009/10 flights. The situation occurred due to the excessive flight prices on average £280-£350 return and is so uncompetitive that flights are running half empty. You can fly to Asia or Canada for the same price. The service on board SATA I found to be very good and quite relaxed but not reflective of the price. With a bit of foresight and good marketing this could be a very successful route. There is currently no other competition except for a code share with TAP which offers the same expensive fare. What a great shame for everyone especially the islands which are beautiful but trapped with only one uncompetitive airline living in a bygone era of state control.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
SATA Air Azores customer review,2,2009-05-26,I used them when travelling between Madeira and Las Palmas/Gran Canaria. Plane was a BAe quite old and uncomfortable although they are currently renovating their fleet. Absolutely no food except water or juices in 1.5hrs and paying a considerable expensive price. Not value for money at all.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
SATA Air Azores customer review,5,2009-05-05,Manchester to Ponta Delgada Sao Miguel. Sadly the plane was less than one-fifth full. They deserve better. The crew were attentive very pleasant and very helpful with a never-ending supply of free drinks as well as an adequate meal. I would definitely travel with SATA again.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
SATA Air Azores customer review,4,2009-04-05,Manchester to Ponta Delgada via Gatwick. Crew friendly and onboard service was excellent. Newspapers meals and drinks all included in the price of £175 return. I had a nice Portuguese wine and was offered a second drink. On the return the chicken was a bit overcooked but other than that 2 enjoyable flights - something that is rare these days.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
SATA Air Azores customer review,4,2008-11-21,SATA My husband & I flew to the Acores return. The flight crews were helpful and pleasant and food was what you would expect on a flight. When winds did not allow our flight from Faial to Flores to depart we were put up in and excellent hotel where SATA paid for all meals and accommodation. Outstanding service!,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
SATA Air Azores customer review,4,2008-10-09,I fly to San Miguel a minimum of two times a year. Overall I find the service good. However pricing of the fare is substantial given the distance 4.5 hour flight and summer rates averaging in access of $800. Winter rates are within the affordable range. If the Azorean government is serious about promoting tourism in the Azores it needs to aggressively address the monopolistic status it grants Azores Express. By having another airline share this lucrative route travelers will have selection of service and potentialy enjoy lower airfares. This could translate in increase tourism to the Azores.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
SATA Air Azores customer review,4,2008-10-05,Several years ago I made a very negative submission about this airline. I now travel monthly with them from London Gatwick direct to Ponta Delgada. The service is now good and a great improvement. The only negative is with reference to the price of tickets which are still outrageously high. Another curious experience is the use of Christmas music being played even in high summer? If you send an e-mail with reference to an enquiry they can take up to a month to reply in awful cut and paste English with little comment on the initial complaint or request - call them instead!,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
SATA Air Azores customer review,1,2008-09-17,Me and my wife went on a trip from Lisbon to Ponta Delgada. Our experience was poor. For a 346 Euros (one-way) each person on a 2 hours flight a bad sandwich was served the flight attendants made a big effort on smiling and the planes are very old. The bad news is that they are the only airline that flies to S.Miguel.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
SATA Air Azores customer review,4,2008-09-17,Recently flew Sata Internacional from Amsterdam tot Ponta Delegada and return and the experience was very good. On time clean and modern A320 aircraft and friendly staff. Free newspapers headsets hot meal and bar service. Inter island flights with SATA Air Azores were mostly slightly delayed and are basic with free seating and no inflight service whatsoever (except for the occasional local newspaper) but got us from A to B safely.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
SATA Air Azores customer review,1,2008-09-11,Flew out of Toronto direct flight to Sao Miguel- three hours late. Gate change occurred due to late takeoff. When announcement was made for passengers to board there were no Sata personnel to board the passengers. Much confusion was evident. Onboard the cabin crew were miserable and rude to passengers. Little attempt was made to speak English to those passengers who did not speak Portuguese. The meal was not hot nor tasty best part of the meal was the dinner roll and the wine. Most likely will be the last time I fly Sata. There are other airlines who fly direct.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
