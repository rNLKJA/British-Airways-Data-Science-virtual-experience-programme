I decided to do this as it seemed that it would offer more comfort and if i was going to pay so much extra for luggage, i may as well include the others. The meals had to be preordered but i did not get what i ordered. You had to pay separately for drinks other than water. The waiting time for check in was a disgrace and i was in a queue for approx 90 minutes on my return journey and only passed through security whilst the plane was boarding which meant a rush through the airport to catch my plane. This was very stressful and then the ""Premium"" upgrade i had paid for did not include any priority boarding or any such benefit. The flight left on time and landed in good time.

There was more trouble with hand luggage where at the boarding gate passengers were told they had to check in their hand luggage due to the lack of space in the overhead lockers.

"""no information was available""",3,2018-02-15,"I flew with Blue Air on Jan 19th from Liverpool to Rome. This flight was delayed by 14 hours - which is a significant delay as I was taking a short city break. The flight was due to leave at 7.15am - so was at the airport very early. Initially everything went smoothly from check-in through security to the queing to board the flight! Problems started when we did not board at the planned time - with the first issue being one of communication. No advice or information was made available to passengers that the flight was being delayed. Eventually, the flight status was updated to show a delay but no staff could be found to provide a reason or manage expectations as to how long the delay would be. As the day progressed, a voucher was handed out for refreshments (which did not cover the cost of the cheapest meal) but no information was available beyond what could be read on the screen of the expected departure time. It was not until mid afternoon that some staff did make themslves available and advise that the cause of the problems were technical issues and at this point, they were unsure if the flight would leave at all. Eventually, Blue Air did commit that a flight would leave that day to Rome and we started boarding just before 8pm. Once we were all seated, just as I thought we might depart, other passengers were boarded who were told to sit anywhere. It was only at this point, we found out 2 flights had been merged, with the second group of passengers bound for Bucharest. It took a considerable amount of time for this group to board and find seats - straining tempers of a number of passengers as groups were being split up and the air crew took a back seat during the confusion, leaving people to seat themselves. Eventually we departed at 9pm. During the flight, the aircrew were not particularly helpful or communicative with what was happening. I appreciate that technical issues can happen and delays do occur but it is entirely within the power of the airline to inform passengers with what is happening and give regular updates. By the time Blue Air did start speaking to people (afternoon for a 7am scheduled departure), tempers were strained - so why wait so long? And why didnt they tell us flights were being merged. Due to the length of the delay I fully expect compensation to be available for this flight, however to date, I have had zero responses to my emailed requests. Not impressed.

The computer system automatically checked me out and didn't let me add baggage because it was less that 4 hours before the flight. That meant when I got to the airport I got smacked with both a baggage fee and a check in fee even though I had already checked in! The staff were rude snarky and went out of their way to be unhelpful. When paying the fee I had to get out of the check-in line and go to the ticketing office where the representative refused to give me change in euros and refused to let me use visa to pay which forced me to get out of line again and take out local currency with the ATM. Once checked-in we were informed that the flight would be an hour late due to maintenance issues. Past security we sat and were later informed that the flight would be delayed another 5 hours! This mean I would be missing my next connecting flight. We were forced to sign a document acknowledging that they were abiding by the E.U. rules of regulation before we were allowed to go back to the food court area or leave the airport. We were then told that the flight would be 7 hours delayed! In the end the flight was 8.5 hours delayed and the plane was kept at an inhumane temperature that felt like 0 degrees. We were not compensated in anyway and even when we got to the next airport and asked a different representative they said there was nothing they could do. It was a complete nightmare. For the sake of saving a few dollars to fly I tell you from experience it is not worth it. I will never fly with this company again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,False,
Blue Air customer review,9,2014-07-29,Bucharest to Brussels (22/06/2014) and Rome to Bucharest (03/07/2014). Good prices. On-time boarding late departure not Blue Air's fault. Smooth flights old B-737 planes clean and seemed to be in good technical condition nice inflight magazine snacks/drinks for charge not overpriced. Professional and attentive cabin crew excellent pilots.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,True,
Blue Air customer review,1,2013-07-19,We flew Bucharest - Rome - Bucharest. Flight to Rome postponed for half of the day at the last minute. We received confirmation only 3 days before the flight. Return flight also postponed several hours a few days before the flight. In Rome we had to pay 8 Euro person for some security fee. We were not informed in advance of this additional payment. Staff not friendly at all. Do not recommend.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,False,
Blue Air customer review,1,2013-07-09,Bucharest to Larnaca Cyprus (return flight) in June 2013. This was only one part of a multi-city trip. In order to avoid any problems with luggage we paid on line to Blue-Air for one extra piece of luggage. Upon departure from Bucharest we were charged 15 Euros per person for check-in at the airport. When embarking the airplane the carry- on luggage was found not fit to Blue-Air carry-on box/cage and we were charged an extra 55 Euros. We had traveled with this same carry-on luggage from Chicago New York Amsterdam and Bucharest without any problem. The same luggage seemed to fit in the carry-on fitting cage in Larnaca for the flight back. The experience with the Blue Air check-in team in Bucharest was extremely disappointing not only to us but to many of the passengers and in fact with all these extra additions to the cost we would have been better of with Tarom or another proper airline - which we are sure we will on the next occasion. Your service in Bucharest was sub-par and will not be recommended.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,False,
Blue Air customer review,,2013-06-23,We have recently flown from Bucharest Romania to Venice Italy on a flight that was originally scheduled to leave at 17.45 pm. Two days before departure they rescheduled it to leave at 0.40 the next day and they let us know by email. One day later the day before departure they rescheduled it for 22.40 but they forgot to change the date back - so a mess resulted with several passengers not showing up for the flight. We were lucky to go to the airport as they do not reply to phone calls and ask them if the flight was still scheduled for the original day and they confirmed it with only 5 hours delay. The rep apologized in person but we could have missed the flight if we believed the email which showed the next date! Completely unprofessional.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,False,
Blue Air customer review,1,2013-06-23,"Sibiu - Stuttgart. Worst flight experience. Rude and aggressive personnel including the gentleman from boarding who targeted passengers like the police (""I want her checked"" - referring to me and my carry on). I had to pay an additional 55e for my hand luggage because they didn't deem it fit (even though I always fly with the same bag!) as cabin luggage. Dismissive and denigrating attitude towards all passengers.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,False,
Blue Air customer review,6,2013-04-01,London Luton - Bacau return. Long queues at Luton check-in which barely moved for 15 minutes until further desks were opened. Thereafter smooth. Boeing 737-400 virtually full in both directions. Dark blue leather seats slightly showing their age but interior otherwise fine including toilets. Drinks (including decent Romanian wine) available to purchase and staff seemed friendly. On return route there seemed to be wider selection of sandwiches and snacks on offer. Return flight delayed by 30 minutes with no explanation given (at least not in English). In general seemed perfectly adequate low-cost carrier (although my travelling companion who had bought the tickets at relatively short notice told me that they were not cheap).,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,3,,True,
Blue Air customer review,9,2013-04-01,Dublin to Bucharest return with Blue Air in March 2013. Have to say no problems at all with the flights. Quick check-in in both Dublin and Bucharest. No issues with baggage (I had made sure that we complied with their specifications). They didn't seem too fussy about bag sizes going from Dublin - Bucharest but on return journey each carry-on bag was checked. Flights themselves were fine. Both departed and arrived more-or- less on time (despite snow in Bucharest). Booked seats at the front of the plane - no issues. The planes were quite warm both ways and the toilets could definitely do with modernising/replacement but that's a minor quibble. For Eur80 return I don't think you could beat them. Would definitely recommend. Website is not the best (as mentioned by earlier posters). Difficult to find e.g. how to add a bag after flight is booked. However their help desk replied to my email queries very quickly with clear concise instructions on how to add a bag.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Blue Air customer review,,2013-02-02,Luton - Bucharest. Interesting to say the least. Plane is old and as such the seats are awful! My friend didn't even have to press to recline as it did it by itself during the whole journey!! Plus the plane was boiling hot. I can't wait for the return flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Blue Air customer review,4,2013-01-18,BGY-OTP and back. The first bad remark is about the website: slow complicated and inefficient. In Milan Bergamo the boarding was fair and those who booked and paid for their seat like me were allowed to board first. B737 is very old but the legroom better than Ryanair and the seat relatively comfortable. The crew were quite young but not very friendly. On the way back the boarding in Bucharest was chaotic and many people were trapped by an employee who checked the dimension of all baggage. Many were forced to pay 55 euros to load the luggage and very intense discussions took place between some passengers and the employees. In short flights were ok and we arrived on time on both legs. However they have to improve their ground services improve the website and make in sort to have a more friendly staff.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Blue Air customer review,1,2012-10-04,Luton to Bucharest Awful. Old 737-400 very tired and dirty booking was a nightmare everything was an extra including booking a seat so we didn't bother. On the way back and my wife and I were split up and no one was interested. Will fly Wizz or BA next time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Blue Air customer review,,2012-09-11,I flew from London Luton to Bucharest and back and I had one of the most awful experiences. It was impossible to receive an itinerary per email. Secondly the cabin was extremely hot until the plane was in the air. Even the stewards were using the magazines as a fan. Most important on the flight back we were allowed at check in to take our hand luggage onboard but at the gate they weighed it and didn't allow us to get on the flight until paying 50 euros for 3 kg overweight on one of the bags. We reduced it to 1.5kg and still didn't allow us. Instead of weighing it at check in before security they left it on purpose to do it at the gate. Moreover they said it's 50 euros but took 250 RON Selected seats that we paid for were already given to someone else as well and we had to get others. Luckily were quite early at the check in so we got only one row further but if we were late we would have received even worse seats. The crew had no clue where we will get our bags whether at the airplane steps or with the rest of the luggage. Hugely disappointing experience and I would never recommend them.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Blue Air customer review,5,2012-06-17,DUB-BCM return in June 2012. Flying with Blue Air produced very different experiences going out and coming back. At Dublin they were very inefficient. They had one staff member on check-in for a full 737 so it took ages. When I eventually reached the check-in desk the staff member told me the flight was delayed by half an hour. Fair enough I said and I texted my girlfriend in Romania who was to pick me up from the airport in Bacau. It didn't stop there however. When the staff eventually arrived at the boarding gate half an hour late they informed us that the gate had changed causing yet another delay. When we finally got on the plane it literally sat there for another half an hour and we left Dublin a total of one hour and forty minutes late. Now this would be slightly understandable at a peak time like three in the afternoon. However this was at one in the morning. There were no other flights to cause congestion! The flight itself was fine and smooth but there were so many screaming children that getting any sleep was impossible. Legroom was better than Ryanair but that isn't saying much. Coming back was much better in relation to time. We left Bacau on time and even arrived in Dublin ten minutes early so I was happy about that. Screaming children was a problem again (another night flight) but it was cheap so I guess I can't be too upset. As for food and beverages there were none for free just a ridiculously overpriced menu. Unless it proves unavoidable I probably won't fly Blue Air in the future.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Blue Air customer review,5,2012-02-17,LTN-BBU-LTN. Both flights on old Boeing 737-400. Dirty cabin old tired and dirty blue leather seats air conditioning system did not work and some tray tables were broken. Good seating assignment system that works well and cabin crew on both flights friendly and attentive. We will definitely be flying Wizz Air until Blue Air has replaced their fleet of ageing aircraft.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Blue Air customer review,10,2011-08-23,Bacau-Brussels return. Pleasant flight although shortly delayed apologies given by Cabin crew after boarding. Cabin crew were nice and helpful and seemed interested in our comfort. Plane was rather old but ok. Bacau Airport is very small with only 2 check-in desks. Ticket price was more than fair.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Blue Air customer review,7,2011-08-16,Luton to Bucharest return. On the outbound flight we had a very cramped seat and one of the air stewardesses was quite rude. On the return flight the check-in attendant at Baneasa airport was again very unfriendly. Leg room on the return was much more spacious at the front of the plane. Both flights were on time so no problems there.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Blue Air customer review,9,2011-06-10,Dublin to Bacau return. I had a bit of trouble trying to book tickets using their web-site but the representatives in Dublin office sorted it for me over the phone. The flight attendants were extremely pleasant on both flights toilets clean and stocked. Seats spacious for a budget airline but ask for window or aisle not the middle seat. I would choose Blue Air rather than Ryanair.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Blue Air customer review,,2011-01-07,My first experience of Blue Air was positive: cheap ticket and reliable service nothing fancy absolutely low cost. The second time I booked Stuttgart–Sibiu the flight was cancelled. I was ensured on the phone I could get a refund. However in spite of numerous phone calls and emails and promises made by customer service in Germany and in Romania the fare was never refunded. I will not fly Blue Air again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Blue Air customer review,7,2011-01-07,An interesting experience. The website booking was fine though it changed suddenly into Romanian halfway through the booking process with no ability to change back to English. The aircraft on Luton to Baneasa routes are not always Blue Air aircraft and planes themselves are ancient. Flights were on time Baneasa airport is a wonderful relic. It works but only just. Any more flights per day and it would be overloaded. While we were away the airline seemed to get sued by someone and local TV suggested that flights might stop. We were pleased to get to the airport to find this was not the case. Planes were comfortable although I'm sure the cabin crew were smoking behind the curtain at the back on one flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Blue Air customer review,,2010-07-24,"Bucharest Baneasa - London Luton. Delays delays and more delays with terrible customer service. Flight time changed the day before from 1545 to 1835. Half the people on the flight including myself were unaware of the change so were at the airport way too early. I asked at the Blue Air desk why the flight was delayed and I was told ""Blue Air don't have enough planes"". Baneasa airport is worse than a bus terminal nowhere to sit poor air conditioning (in 35C temperatures) and uninterested staff. 1835 came and went but we did eventually board a plane at 1910. The excitement was short lived as we were asked to get off the plane and were bussed back to the cramped terminal. There was no information given out by the Blue Air staff and for long periods they disappeared to avoid angry passengers. People were having to phone the airline to get any information. After being strung along for a while with false promises we were told we would be taking off at 2240. They initially did not want to give out refreshments even when reminded of the EU regulations but after much arguing eventually did. Never again!",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Blue Air customer review,1,2010-07-04,We were stranded in Bucharest after the Sky Europe Collapse so we had no choice but to fly with Blue Air to Brussels. Baneasa airport is terrible has to be one of the worst in the world badly organized Staff unfriendly rude and unhelpful throughout. Only 2 checkin counters for about 5 flights leaving around the same time terminal is tiny and was fully packed. To make matters even worse they have a stupid policy where if you have baggage to checkin you need to pay a fee of I think 20 euro per piece but they cannot take the money at the checkin desk you need to shuffle through the fully packed terminal and then go and line up at another desk with even more people and pay for it separately then return to the checkin desk so they can check you have paid. The whole process took around 2 hours and we never moved more than a few metres the whole time. When we were finally bussed to the plane the staff were rude and someone I was travelling with has a fear of flying so they wanted us to be seated together but they would not allow it even though there was a spare seat at the back which I then moved to after the flight took off. One cabin crew member yelled very loudly at me because apparently my bag was too heavy but no one mentioned it in the terminal. Staff at the airport spoke little English. The plane was old and we really questioned the safety of it. Complimentary water served but then cabin crew at the back of the plane for the rest of the flight they even were not present to prepare the cabin for landing. On landing there were many people (Romanians) on mobile phones making phone calls etc none of the staff said anything. Mentioned it to staff after landing and they said they did not see it happen. I hope never to fly with them again and I urge anyone to have a think before choosing blue air or a flight that leaves from Baneasa but the whole thing is an experience in itself.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Blue Air customer review,8,2010-06-22,Luton to Sibiu. The flights were early staff friendly and spoke ok English. The aircraft on this route is an old B737-300 with rather uncomfortable seats. Excellent fares when booked in advance.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
