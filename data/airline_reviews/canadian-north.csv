"""is a nice airline""",9,2019-03-10,"Not Verified |  Family trip from Montréal to Edmonton, Boeing 737-200. Canadian North is a nice airline. Food great. No inflight Entertainment. Beverages and Cabin Service nice. It was a calm, non-turbulent flight.",False,Boeing 737-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Edmonton,March 2019,5,3,,5,4,,True
"""luggage was bumped in Ottawa""",2,2017-09-05,"✅ Verified Review |  Ottawa to Iqaluit. When I arrived in Iqaluit, I was told that my luggage was bumped in Ottawa due to the aircraft being over-weight. There were 5 or 6 passengers in the same predicament. I had to go pick up my luggage at the airport the next day. When I mentioned that the same thing (luggage bumped - similar to other passengers that day) had happened to a member of our office the day that I received my luggage, I was informed that Canadian North had had to bump that day's luggage in order to put the previous day's bumped luggage on the flight. Note that there was no compensation for the luggage being bumped, nobody was asked to give up their seat due to the over-weight situation, and obviously cargo was not removed to permit all the passenger's luggage to be loaded on the flight. In fact they did not even deliver the bumped luggage.",False,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ottawa to Iqaluit,August 2017,3,3,,1,1,,False
"""efficient and very pleasant""",9,2015-12-24,My husband and I traveled to Yellowknife for a day. The main reason was that we wanted to visit Buffalo Airways. Canadian North were fantastic. Both services on time and on the way back to Edmonton we were lucky enough to travel on a 737-200 Combi which was fantastic. The crew on the way home made us feel so welcome. They were efficient and very pleasant. Great breakfast on the way up and a good dinner on the way back. If only they were a bit closer to our home in Australia. We would be more than happy to travel with Canadian North any time. A great experience.,False,Boeing 737-300 Combi,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Edmonton to Yellowknife,November 2015,4,5,,4,5,,True
Canadian North customer review,6,2010-08-04,I fly this airline regularly between Yellowknife and Edmonton. Staff is generally friendly and the complimentary food service is a nice touch but generally inedible. Unfortunately they have the tendency to change your seats without notice and you will not find out until check-in time. Much of the reason for this change is that if they notice a flight is only half booked they use half of the plane for cargo which eliminates the first 6 rows of seats. Thus when booking on Canadian North make sure you book the back row of seats (between 10-16) and you likely won't have to worry about your seat being changed. Prepare to be packed in like sardines on most Canadian North flights though. Seat pitch/width is standard.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Canadian North customer review,9,2008-11-23,Ottawa to Iqaluit (formally know as Frobisher Bay) in Canada’s Arctic. First time flying with Canadian North. Checked in at the Ottawa airport for the morning flight. The gate was located in the new terminal. Flight was on a 737 with about 60 seats. Asked the flight attendant where the rest of the seats were? Was informed that the airplane was in a “combi mode” and had freight in the forward half of the plane. She also explained that's why we had to board stairs at the back because the airbridge can not be used. Flight took just under 3 hours. Outstanding service. From a hot breakfast hot towels and coffee with Irish cream all included in the fare. Return back to Ottawa 2 days later with the same great services. Meal this time was an Arctic Char with free wine and another coffee and Irish cream. There was no entertainment consoles on board but it did not seem to mater as there were no bad jokes by the flight attendants either. Will fly with them again!,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Canadian North customer review,5,2008-03-02,Had a chance to fly Canadian North for the first time from Calgary to Inuvik in the Northwest Territories. Check in friendly with no extra charge for my 4 bags. The aircraft was a Boeing 737 which replaced the Fokker-100. Flight Attendants were friendly attentive. We were served a hot breakfast. Return flight equally as pleasant with a hot dinner this time and free wine. The service reminded me of the Wardair days. I only wish that they flew across lower Canada as well.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Canadian North customer review,5,2008-02-07,Flew with Canadian North on two occasions. Found both flights to be very enjoyable. First flight was Edmonton to Norman Wells and the next was Edmonton to Yellowknife. Found check in staff to be friendly and helpful both times. Flight Attendants were very courteous and friendly. No corny jokes unlike Westjet. Meals are also included with the fare. For breakfast it was a hot or cold meal. For dinner on the way home it was pork or chicken with free wine almost unheard of today on domestic economy flights. The airplane was an older 737 but in nice condition and lots of baggage allowance. Would fly with them again and strongly recommend them.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False
