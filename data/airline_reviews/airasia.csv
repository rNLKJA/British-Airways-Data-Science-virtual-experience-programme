AA customer support system has 4 ways to contact Air Asia which are Live chat (24/7), call centre, Twitter(24/7) and e-form. I have tried 4 of them: Live chat (24/7): it has been removed - 26 Dec 2018 URL No Longer Exists You have to wait for average 1 hour on live chat queue to say hi to a live chat staff. If you miss the screen when the conversation started, you will kick out from the chatroom by livechat staff, when you check back the screen, it showed ""thank you for contacted live chat"". You have to wait for another one hour. Live chat staff could simply end your conversation without your notice, so even your question not yet finish,you will be kicked out by the staff again.

I wanted to buy/add-on/upgrade my baggage to 25kg (3 days before my flight), but it is no longer available on ""modify"" at the airasia homepage.

It took few days/about 1 month to reply to you, they could just reply sorry that they have done their best and simply closed the case straight after. I've created the same case for 3 times because the staff closed my case without solving my problem, but it is written in the email that my case has been solved, or you didn't reply the email within 7 days. Here comes the tactic: at first you can still contact the AA staffs, but after 3-4 emails, suddenly your reply cannot reach to the AA support team and this will end up case closed because the system shows that you didnt reply to the AA email. When you reply, a no reply email message will tell you that your case has closed, if you need any assistant, please send an e form again! I strongly advise you be aware when you book the AA ticket.

This was very frustrating as it also happened on my flight from Singapore to Kota Kinabalu where the  check in staff told me i had to pay them if we wanted to sit together. I challenged the way the seats were allocated in Singapore to be told that it wasnt anything to do with them it was a computer who allocated seats. Clearly the computer doesn't have a family or doesn't want to sit with its family if it ever travels.

On the flight from Kota Kinabalu to Singapore i had to speak to the gate agent who helped us find seats together. I dont understand why Air Asia cause families problems at check in when they can clearly accommodate seats together.

After I finished checking in, a guy stopped me and wanted to weigh my luggage. The total weight of my 2 pieces were just slightly over 10kg (the total permitted weight is 7kg for AirAsia). This is exactly what I came with, perhaps less. I threw away an old top and flip flops after this trip too. They weighed my luggage on my outward flights, I can't remember the total weight for that, but they let me through, but gave me a little advice to make sure I was within limit the next time. However, on my return flight, this guy did not let me through, he took my boarding pass away, even when I told him I was running late, I only had less than 10min left before boarding time!

I simply had to directly book a business class seat. Then in 2016 when my pass expired I again went on the AirAsia site and purchased another 6 upgrades. What they didn't state clearly is that the pass no longer guarantees an upgrade, in fact it is useless as you are required to book an economy seat and then go onto the optiontown site and request an upgrade. So you pay a higher price and you have almost no chance of getting an upgrade. This is because Air Asia has already sold a huge number of these passes and has already obtained that money. So then if any business class seats are left, they heavily discount them. So for my new upgrade pass I received no upgrades. I even went on line and saw that there was only 1 business class seat left on a flight and although I had the pass, I paid the heavily discounted extra price of $800 so I could receive the seat. I then made a complaint and was told the pass could be extended, but this was a 1 off for 3 months only, and sure enough I didn't receive an upgrade during this time. My advice is to not buy an upgrade pass but take your luck and just try as a one off on the optiontown site, whereby if you don't receive the upgrade they at least refund your money. On the pass they only give you useless 'credits' which you will never use in the limited time period.",False,,Business,Premium Economy,Kuala Lumpur to Bali,April 2017,2,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",4,1,,1,False

"""inflight service is rude""",1,2017-04-03,"✅ Verified Review | Surat Thani to Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia has to be one of the all around worst airlines I have ever flown. I don't write reviews, this is the first. I travel internationally a lot and am used to difficult situations and bad service. It takes a little effort to get me annoyed. Their website doesn't work very well. It constantly kicks you off. The website won't take any of my Visa cards. Because of this, I am forced to purchase tickets thru a 3rd party such as orbitz with the same cards where purchasing add ones such as baggage is not always an option. Some flights include a checked bag, others don't. So, if their website doesn't work and you can't pay in advance, you are left with getting ripped off at the airport on your bag fees. Inflight service is rude and narrow minded. For example, I booked meal service for a flight in February 2017 from Bangkok to Hanoi. I ordered a coffee in advance, however, after traveling all night, I decided to forgoe the coffee and sleep instead. I asked for a water and was told ""no, you must have coffee because it is what you ordered."" I said ""okay, I'll pay for the water"". Staff gave me an annoyed look and pushed the cart away. I was not rude, I was not demanding, but was treated very poorly. I ended up having to flag down another attendant and ask for a water. This was not an isolated incident. Similar things have happened to me before and I seen it happen to many others. Maybe my expectations are to blame here because of where I come from, but the capacity for abstract thought seems to be lacking within this organization. Being kind, courteous and compassionate is not a hard thing. Unfortunately, there is no recourse for me. They don't care.

Obviously not feasible to leave a two year old five rows away from nearest parent for a three hour flight, finally agreed could ask other passenger's if they'd mind swapping. Couldn't wait at front of plane or on bridge until everyone else had boarded though as that would delay boarding - he'd have to sit on his own until everyone else was in their seats and then we could try to swap if there was time before take off. In case you haven't met a two year old, getting him to sit next to strangers in a strange place with no parents in sight is unlikely to work and I imagine you'd probably get arrested for child cruelty in some countries.

For me, that just could not be more annoying. AirAsia is no longer a budget flight. The price has gone up tremendously. It is often more expensive than Batik Air, the premium brand of the Lion Air group. Unlike Lion, I hardly heard anyone complaining about Batik problems such as delays.

Very sloppy from Air Asia as they have greatly invested in a big marketing campaign at terminal 2F itself. Simple mistake, big consequence. Check in was easy, quick and efficient.

I have flown a number of airlines in the region and in fact Chinese speaking crew are the norm for routes with high Chinese traffic. Return flight from Wuhan (WUH) to Kota Kinabalu (BKI). Wuhan International Airport is a rather small terminal with two rows of multiple check-in counters adjacent to each other. The check-in process started at 22.00 and was prompt. Boarding was smooth despite a number of flights departed at this time. Boarding was rather efficient without cabin crew greeting passengers as soon as they stepped onboard. Communication breakdown is unavoidable as all cabin crew allocated for this flight were non Chinese speaking crew. Soon after airborne, the cabin crew brought the meal cart out, no pre booked meals were served. About two hours later, I was woken by an announcement from the crew to inform any passenger who found a lost phone to return it to them. Having found no response, the cabin crew had no choice but to permit the passenger who lost her phone to make an announcement. This was not the first time I have experienced this situation. In my previous flight, one of the cabin crew had no choice but to turn to me to assist her to communicate with the passengers.",False,A320-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,WUH to BKI and return,March 2016,4,3,,5,5,,,True

I flew from HoChiMinhCity to Kuala Lumpur return. As with most discount airlines the ""all in price"" listed in the booking is hard to find. First of all you have to wade through the various ad-ons for baggage insurance etc deducting them as you go or you end up with an inflated fare. But to my surprise as I hadn't experienced this gouge before the booking imposed a $12 fee for using my credit card. As well the onboard duty free sales do not take credit cards only Malaysian currency and US dollars despite stating that all major currencies were accepted. My seat-mate on the inbound flight had to convince staff to accept Euros. All in all after all costs were added up the flight was only marginally cheaper than Vietnam Airlines and far less hassle with a full service carrier. Air Asia advertises low-cost but their fares have risen dramatically in the past few years. I don't think the average customer wants to have to spend time and energy having to find the ""all in price"" deducting the various ad-ons only to be stung at the end with the credit card charge. By then you are so fed up with the search for the initial fare that you just agree to pay the ""fine"" for using your credit card. In my caes it amounted to a surcharge of about 15%.

AirAsia customer review,1,2015-01-14,As I write this my wife is trying to get home from Bali. They promoted their new direct flight from Melbourne to Bali late last year which we booked only to be told two days before departure that they never had authorisation for that route. As a result she had to travel through KL and this added an extra 8 hours to her trip. They promised that the issue of the direct flight would be fixed before her return trip and guess what. Another text two days before she returns home saying that she is going through KL again. Then the morning of coming home the Flight to KL was cancelled and she was put on an earlier flight meaning she had to leave her hotel in a mad rush at 4am to get to the airport. In total it will now take her 16 hours to get from Bali to Melbourne with this joke of a so called airline. Add to that the customer service is poor the planes are dirty and they promise things they have no intention of delivering.

Boarding was fast seat was extremely narrow and I was rather shocked about it as only recently I flew with MAS. Flight was very bumpy but this is most probably due to weather.

About 4 hours before the flight I received an email saying our flight upgrade was unsuccessful. We got on the plane to an announcement that there were upgrades available to business class for almost double what we originally paid - 4 in fact. We feel ripped off.

AirAsia customer review,2,2014-12-22,Flew with them this week between Bangalore Chandigarh and back to Bangalore. I feel the airline has potential if handled properly. The ground staff leave a lot to be desired. Our flight from Bangalore although boarded on time the crew could not clear for quite a while. Pilot seemed to take each thing at a time effecting delay. The return leg was further confusion as fog delayed the incoming flight but no one was interested to let the passengers know the same. No announcements. Also in the aircraft the crew just forgot to ask all to switch off the phones. If it is not much of a problem then why push for it all other times.

Gate agents never said anything about the delay which I hate - just say the flight is late. We departed 20 minutes late and arrived in Siem Reap about 10 minutes late. Short 50 minute flight. Plenty of leg room (I'm 175 cm) and had a seat in the middle open so plenty of room. Flight attendants very friendly. Didn't eat or drink but snacks looked reasonably priced.

Agents were friendly both on the ground and in the air. Inbound flight was late an hour so departure was delayed the same time ground staff announced the delay just at the time we would have been departing.

AirAsia customer review,2,2014-12-10,November 26th Chiang Mai to Hong Kong. Early morning flight (departure time 06.00) and while the standard check- in for international flights is 3 hours prior to departure time the counter failed to be staffed until 04.20. A small irritant yes but it was a harbinger of things to come. Ticketing and luggage handling pretty typical of any other airlines with the exception of dealing with excess baggage. Each bag is weighed and there is no leeway whatsoever. Every increment of one kilo was billed as excess baggage. They do not make this easy. The passenger must leave the queue walk across the terminal to the Air Asia cashier process the necessary transaction and then return to the ticket agent to complete the process. We knew we had excess weight we had pre-purchased an additional 20 kilos of sporting equipment. The agent unilaterally decided that trekking equipment was not sporting equipment therefore it was to be classified as excess baggage. We were forced to pay an additional 5575 baht (approximately 175.00 USD) simply based on his arbitrary determination. We pre-ordered and prepaid for an inflight meal. Their idea of a breakfast meal is a small tin of rice or noodles and a 4 oz. cup of water. It was the worst attempt at a meal I have ever witnessed. On this trip we used 10 different airlines. Did Air Asia get us to Hong Kong on time? Yes. Was the plane clean? Yes. Did we receive value for the money spent? Not even close. Of all the airline companies we flew was AirAsia at least average? Not even close! Would we ever fly this company again knowing now how they treat their customers?

AirAsia customer review,3,2014-12-10,I needed to get to Bangkok Chiang Mai and Krabi. To do this within my allotted time span I had no alternative but to fly between these cities. The price differential is quite marked so I elected to try Air Asia which would allow me to compare it with Bangkok Airways who I had flown with before. The aircraft was configured as a single cabin. The first few rows sported cotton covers over the seat headrest and were reserved for passengers willing to pay a premium. The other seats were so close together that for any person over five feet six inches (like myself) were forced into a painful contortion to avoid digging their knees into the seat-back in front. Minutes after the aircraft departed the four cabin crew members wasted no time in blocking the aisles with trolleys flogging drinks and snacks followed quickly by the same four trying their best to get passengers to buy mementoes of Air Asia. My next flight (Chiang Mai to Krabi) due to depart at 12 noon was cancelled. Its replacement was rescheduled to depart at 5.30pm. This meant a totally wasted day for me and meant arriving at my pre-booked hotel at 9pm instead of 3pm. No apologies – no explanations from Air Asia. The only consistency being the aircraft seating configurations and 2 hours of discomfort instead of one. More of the same on my last flight so there is little point in relating it.

Having been a regular AA and AAX flyer since 2006 we knew what to expect - value for money. Our expectations were kept at a reasonable level and once again we were not disappointed. Cabin service was good. I have found AA and AAX cabin staff to be at least as good as those of full-service airlines but some of the ground staff at the old LCCT and on the Gold Coast have been abrupt if now downright rude.

We were very pleasantly surprised at the amount of space and the ability to turn the seat into an almost flat bed albeit the incline was just enough to make sliding down the seat a bit of a problem. The service was excellent and whilst the food was quite basic and they had not got our pre ordered meals correct the food was adequate.

We were given a glass of orange juice on arrival and the meals we had selected were delivered soon after take-off. These are normal economy fare but at the fare we paid we did not expect any different. Alcohol was available for payment.

I had already booked a flight from BKK to SYD on another airline but had to cancel and find another flight closer to my departure date. AirAsia had a business class ticket available departing from Don Mueang at an excellent price so I bought it. The first flight from DMK to KUL didn't have a designated business class seating section but my seat was in the 3rd row so that was convenient. The flight from KUL to SYD did have a separate business class seating area with chairs that reclined almost flat for sleeping. The chair width was ample. Although a 180 degree flatbed would have been better AirAsia's was decent and I was able to sleep fairly well. The service was excellent and we were given extra snack treats.

We checked in several hours before our flight and were disappointed to find that we had been given seats in two different rows (my husband and I were flying with our two kids). Obviously we had hoped to sit together as a family but thought ""oh well it's not the end of the world"". We boarded the plane and realised that we were not only in different rows but in 4 different seats. We were absolutely gob-smacked that an airline could put a 2 year old on his own! When we waved down the air hostess and explained that our son who had just turned two could not sit on his own she told us that the flight was full and we would have to take our dedicated seats. I told her that our 2 year old could not possibly sit on his own and she suggested that he sit on my lap instead. Pretty disappointing when you paid for 4 seats. Just when I thought things couldn't get much worse the food trolley came around and after placing my order for a hot meal for myself and my two kids I was told that they only accept cash and not card. I didn't have any cash on me (I had actually tried to withdraw cash at the airport but the ATM was out of order) so they told me I was unable to order any food. I said that there must be some other option as my kids were hungry and surely there was something they could do but they did not help at all. My poor kids basically spent the whole flight crying with hunger and they wouldn't even give me a bottle of water (as our water had been taken off us at the airport by security).

I have flown with them for 7 years and I'm losing patience at the way they do not care for passengers who support them. They are not cheap anymore.

Surprisingly three of us were assigned to three different seats in three different rows. I asked the check-in counter officer to change the seats. However he said that the flight was full and suggested I purchase seats in advance on my next flights. Some thoughts on this incident: 1) Is this Air Asia business model? Separating a toddler from his/her parents could PUSH the parents to purchase seats on the next flight. This is shown as an ads on AirAsia magazine. 2) Is safety Air Asia's concern? Separating a toddler from his/her parents raises a safety risk. Suppose an emergency event occurs. Who will help the toddler? Do you think a stranger sitting next to him/her would help him/her? Finally I exchanged seats with other passengers. This definitely causes unpleasant for them.

AirAsia customer review,6,2014-09-06,Praya/Lombok to Kuala Lumpur (KLIA2) as a HiFlyer. I booked the Premium Flex fare to enjoy the extras such as 20kg checked baggage and priority seating. Online booking is straightforward if a bit annoying due to the many forced opt-out options one has to explicitly decline. Web check-in however started to be positively jarring: mobile boarding pass didn't work with a European cell number the airport kiosk can't reprint an already issued boarding pass and the whole experience gets very frustrating very soon. Ground staff were helpful but this is too little to overcome the system's shortcomings. Priority boarding is a myth at LOP as there is only a single security line at the gate which opened extremely late. That way everyone finds themselves standing in a long line with no seating while hundreds of empty seats wait inside the gate area. I ended up boarding among the last just to fight for some overhead bin space and reclaim my assigned seat. FAs didn't really seem very engaged and it took some doing to get their attention just to purchase a drink onboard.

AirAsia customer review,9,2014-09-06,AK759 Penang to Singapore 3 Sep. Check-in for this flight was very good barely queued for 3 or so minutes before the airline's agents checked us in. Boarding for this flight was not as organised as I would have preferred. Firstly the airport mixed up the gates so there were a lot of confused passengers rushing to the correct gate. Secondly the gate agents did not issue PA announcements so many passengers quickly rushed to the front of the gate counter in the hope that they'll get to board first which shouldn't be the case for an airline that charges for priority boarding. Boarding was slightly delayed due to preparation of aircraft but the airline made up for the delay by boarding passengers through the front and rear exits. The flight departed Penang just a few minutes late once airborne the crew came around quickly to distribute immigration cards and take orders for drinks/deliver pre-booked meals. Aircraft was a bit worn and tired - my seat pocket was ripped on the left side and passenger in front of me seemed to have trouble reclining. Nevertheless seat was quite comfortable. Arrival in Singapore 10 minutes ahead of schedule and disembarked within 10 minutes of landing. AirAsia is ok for the price will consider using them again for flights to and from Malaysia.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,,True
AirAsia customer review,1,2014-08-28,Boarding was delayed 2 hours because of the incoming flight. This was ok we received vouchers. We boarded the airplane and just after the safety instructions we where informed that there was a problem with an engine. So we waited a further hour when we were informed that we had to disembark. So about 300 passengers left the airport received a coupon and started to queue at the 1 shop to get some food. After an hour of queuing the shop stopped serving claiming that they had run out of food and that we had to go to the other side of security zone to get some food. So we where directed to another queue which turned out to lead to a security check which took away all the fluids that we had bought and returned us exactly where we had started. We queued again to the shop. After an hour the police came and said we had to vacate the area. In both cases an Air Asia representative should have taken the trouble to inform us of what was going on. So then we had a further 3 queues each taking more than an our to pass passport control get hotel vouchers and board busses. Air Asia obviously does not care about our holiday time because if they had they would have canceled the flight earlier so that at least the passengers could spend an afternoon outside of the airport. Air Asia is fine when everything goes well. But when there is a problem they will rip the passengers off.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,,False

On the return journey in August my wallet was stolen at Don Mueang and Airasia held the plane for 20 minutes while their staff assisted with a search.

AirAsia customer review,5,2014-08-15,"Premium/Business class in the month of August KL - Seoul Busan - KL. Melb - KL Sydney - KL. Recently Air Asia tried to rename the premium class to business class. I found the word business class really misleading because it is not a business class yet premium seat is more like it. Well whatever name you call it you cannot only book the ""new business class"" to and from Kuala Lumpur. If you are flying out to and from any Malaysia small city you are blocked from booking the business class. The implication is that the passenger need to purchase multiple itineraries and no luggage check through to the final destination. Why is Air Asia doing this? It is very inconvenient for business man like us when we need to rush from one gate to another and what more to say rushing to collect luggage and check in again. Imagine with the new KLIA2. One has to be really fit to do the long walk and keep the figure cross that he/she can locate the other gate safely. I travel a lot in the ""old premium class"" sometimes it is value for money when it is on offer. There is not much service and no entertainment but it comes with free meals and luggage.

AirAsia customer review,1,2014-08-11,I was informed via email that my flight had been changed from 4.20pm to 3.00pm which was fine but airport services were in fact terrible! Arriving at the counter at 1.15pm I asked the counter if there was a delay in our flight I was told that there was no such delay for our flight and that our boarding time was at 2.30pm. 2.30pm came and went and there was no announcement made regarding our flight. There was no one at the AirAsia departure lounge counter so I went to the check in counter and asked staff what our flight status was. I was then informed that there would be announcements. 3.00pm - no announcements. 3.49pm still no announcements. 4.17pm no announcement. 4.28pm an announcement that our flight will be delayed 1 hour. 5.35pm an announcement that the plane will not arrive until 6.05pm. 6.08pm arrival of the plane. 6.35pm boarding. 7.00pm on the flight I asked the flight attendant for my pre purchased comfort kit and was informed that they did not have any on the flight. As you can imagine after spending over 3hours waiting for the flight and being told that my comfort kit was not available I was mighty ticked. I know that there are circumstances that flight will be delayed and I understand that but the lack of communication given to customers was poor. I had heard such good things regarding AirAsia but after this and the cancelation of our Clark to Kalibo flight on the 14th of November 2013 I will be very hesitant and wary of using AirAsia again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,,False

Having paid a very low price (to us in England) we were expecting a below-Ryanair experience but this was anything but.

On return flight the flight was delayed by 2 hrs. but I needed to be back in KUL on time so I booked another airline on my way back to KUL. Later I exchanged a few e- mails with their station manager in PEN so they handled my delay costs very professionally. All in all not a bad airline to fly with around Asia.

AirAsia customer review,8,2014-06-30,Flew Air Asia in June 2014 from Surat Thani to Kuala Lumpur. The Surat Thani airport is very small you go down an escalator and walk onto the tarmac to board the plane. The plane boarded on-time and very quickly. The flight staff were still vacuuming when I boarded! They boarded the plane quickly and had an easy departure and easy landing. The distance between seats is really small. I am not a big person but these seats are very close! They do recline but not much. Not very comfortable for a long flight but for a short flight you can put up with it. The price was pretty reasonable. They do charge for everything though. I paid extra for a seat assignment one piece of luggage and a chicken dinner. Total came to around $2600 Bhat which is about $80 USD.

However the second one put us into SGN too late to make our connecting flight on to DAD. As soon as we landed in BKK I went to the Air Asia help desk and explained my problem. BTW This is a Thai Air Asia flight. The 2 young staff members couldn't have helped me more. They understood my problem and did a great job fixing it. I've flown them several times and they're a first class low fare carrier. When they charge you for food and drinks on board it's at a reasonable amount.

AirAsia customer review,8,2014-05-19,PER-KUL-HND in April with my 2 year old son. The flights were fine on time and pleasant for the fare paid. However two weeks ago received an email from Air Asia stating that my return KUL-PER flight 26 May has been cancelled - 'for commercial reasons'. Checking their website this particular 0850 KUL departure for Perth no longer appears. So they have just cancelled the flight because the were not enough passengers. As a result instead of a 2 hour connection in KUL I now have an 18 hour connection at KUL. No compensation offered or even interest in the gross inconvenience to passengers who have booked and paid on the basis of a reasonable connection. What can one do for 18 hours with a 2 year old child at KUL? Their customer service is simply mealy mouthed excuses and the claim that a stopover hotel is 'not within their service recovery'.

I had to call the flight attendant with the button and only after my boarding pass was inspected was my food served. The portion was inadequate to say the least.

No apology was offered although she did suggest I use the bathroom in the back. Trying to explain that the airplane should be serviced at every stop regardless of how many flight segments there are in a day was useless and she felt it was not her or the airline's fault that there was no soap.

If you are sick (like I was) on the flight don't expect an air sickness bag in the pocket at your seat nor a blanket you have to buy the blanket. The flight was chaotic!

The savings would be 'significant'. So today I did just that. Only problem - when it came to registering the bag the website froze me out - even after multiple attempts. Simply couldn't register the bag let alone pay a lower fee for it. When we got to the airport I explained the situation. We had checked in online so it was clear I wasn't pulling anyone's leg about trying to get things done on the website. But the check in person gave me the cow in a pasture stare and charged me full freight for the bag again. I explained again it wasn't my fault - I'd tried to do what her colleague had recommended - but their website wasn't working. I then told my story to the person who took my money. Same look.

AirAsia customer review,1,2014-03-18,"Air Asia D7316 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing March 12-13. We have flown on airlines throughout the world and have never been on a worse airline in 50 years of flying. Kuala Lumpur airport is awful. When you ask if there are meals provided they say ""yes"" but don't tell you that you are required to pay extra. If you have cashed in your money because you are flying into another country you are out of luck. We were 6 hours without a coffee water or tea. When we asked for a complimentary coffee the flight attendant said ""No we are a low cost airline"". They nickel and dime you all the way. When you check in they ask if you would like to check your bag. Then hit you with a $30 charge! However they let all kinds of over-sized bags on the plane so getting to your seat is total chaos. Loading the plane is a joke.

AirAsia customer review,7,2014-02-28,REP-KUL. I must say that fares aren't that much cheaper than full service airlines if you only book a few weeks in advance. There are a lot of additional fees some of which are not avoidable. If you have to change your flight you will get clobbered. Check-in was another problem. Their website says that international check-in opens 3 hours before the flight - not true. The check-in did not open until 2 hours before. Once it did the queue did move at a painfully slow pace. The agent seem to have problems with every person checking in and had to call the supervisor over more than once for every passenger. I'd checked in online but not printed my boarding pass (as I had a mobile one sent to my mobile). This caused a lot of problems and needed the supervisor. Once through security everything was a breeze. Organised boarding great cabin crew clean plane comfortable seats and good food. I'd check to see how much you're actually saving before using Air Asia.

When I arrived in KL to check in they inform me my flight was changed to the earlier flight. There was a lot of hassle and waiting but I was provided with my boarding pass. Flight was good aircraft could do with some updating but the flight was half empty which meant flat bed. Check in gave me a hot seat without paying for it. As soon as seat belt sign was off I went to sleep staff left me alone and it was all good. Cant comment on food or how the service was but as far as I am concerned in the air I got what I wanted. The selection of food is quite bland I would prefer to just take my food on board. For the price it was not bad.

A strange incident happened as we were approaching the terminal in Singapore. We were all ready to leave the aircraft when the pilot announced that we would push back to another gate.

AirAsia customer review,7,2014-01-06,"Air Asia Indonesia. KUL-CGK on 12/26 and CGK-SIN on 12/30. Both flights experienced delays.

The legroom was also adequate. I'm 5'11"" (180 cm) and I had a small amount of space in between my knees and the seat in front of me. That being said for a long flight three hours plus it would get a bit tiring. I pre-ordered a meal which tasted fine. Unfortunately it was on a flight that was delayed for two hours and departed after Midnight and I had already eaten the same meal unknowingly twice before. Definitely wasn't in the mood. The price is cheap sure but expect a two hour delay every time which means lots of waiting.

No credit cards are accepted on board. If you pay in dollars balance is paid in MYR- another rip off! There were 2 small children about 10 and 12 years travelling with their parents who changed their seats and moved near to a window just before we landed in KL to get a aerial view of KL. Many hot seats were unoccupied and were vacant throughout the flight and there was at most 20 min flight time left. The children were asked to return to their original seats by the flight attendant as they were not entitled to sit in ""hot"" seats. I thought the way they said was quite rude.

AirAsia customer review,1,2013-12-06,It isn't low cost there are additions to the fares such as seat selection fee baggage fee meal fee and other hidden fees which all adds to and cost as near as a decent airlines like Thai Airways. Their services from ground to in-flight staff were inefficient. KOL-HKT 5 of us were travelling including my 2 year old daughter. Bangkok- Phuket being a short haul flight I skipped the seat selection (my biggest mistake). I told the lady at the check- in counter that we required 3 seats together minutes later our luggage was through and we were handed the boarding passes. All 5 of us were placed at different seats far from each other. Upon boarding I wasn't going to sit down until 3 of us were seated next to each other. A stewardess found 3 passengers who felt sorry for our situation and swapped seats. I saw their so called hot seats for which you pay extras for extra leg room were not any different from those ordinary seats. The seats were so cramped that you can hardly move if the seat in front was reclined back. Air Asia can change their flight timings anytime they want so stay tuned and updated. Our flight was postponed nearly 24 hrs.They claimed that they did try to contact me. At the sales desk we were told to wait an hour and see if there were any no shows. There were so we rushed to check-in luggage through and then told that there are only four seats left and we must hold the baby in our lap. We had no choice rushed to the aircraft as the last call was announced. We struggled just like before with the separated seats even though this time I had pre-selected seats with the original flight. We also had pre-booked meals with the original flight but since we boarded on a different flight they wouldn't serve us any meal. Air Asia in Bangkok lands at Don Muang Airport and not the Suvarnabhumi. The difference in two is that the Don Muang airport is an old airport and later is a new one.

AirAsia customer review,1,2013-10-25,I have traveled this airline twice. While their inflight service is average I found other aspects to be quite awful. I travel extensively across US Europe and Asia so have a good basis of comparison. If there is a problem - don't expect any competent problem solving. Ground staff are poorly trained and unhelpful in case of a problem. First time I traveled my flight from Phuket to Bangkok was delayed several hours and they had no idea when the flight was going to depart or even which gate it would depart from. On a recent flight from Siem Reap to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur several transit passengers had to be offloaded because they could not transit through KL - you need to enter the country and then exit via immigration so those from countries requiring visas were not able to board. They have no transit facilities at their hub in KL. The website clearly states they have through transit facilities - to this the passengers were told by the ground staff manager that the website is frequently incorrect and cannot be relied on. So that is the other problem - their website is unreliable and not kept current by their own admission. which in this day and age is totally unacceptable. Their terminal in KL is awful - it makes a Greyhound bus terminal seem sophisticated and comfortable. There is no place to sit and its bursting at the seams with passengers. If you have a long stopover be prepared to stand around or sit on the floor or on your bag. There is little to eat or drink until after you go past immigration to the gate but you can't check in to your flight until 2 hours before departure - so if you have a long break between flights you better come equipped. I have taken my last flight on AirAsia - it is truly the worst airline I have flown.

Check-in was easy and it is how you talk with the check-in staff in order to get seat you want/close to your partner/friend.

AirAsia customer review,6,2013-07-17,Pekanbaru to Bandung and vice versa. During the flight there was nothing too special. Special services for passengers with red carpet service in Pekanbaru - nothing.

Booked ticket 3 months earlier received reminder/confirmation email 4 days before departure 2 days before departure another email showing different times by 5 hours - no explanation just confirmation of flights but with different departure/arrival times. Arrival at DMK (Bangkok) would have had us there 1 hour after our connecting flight had left. No option but to go 1 day earlier and stay in hotel. Chaotic check-in at DMK under staffed 1 hour just waiting to check-in not good enough especially when it's a premium ticket they claim dedicated check-in for premium but no such counter exists.

AirAsia customer review,2,2013-07-15,FD 2976/2977 Bangkok -–Denpasar return. A very disappointing experience. Checked in online and only had to drop our bag spent over an hour at the counter waiting for staff to reconcile their problem. Good that they are using Don Muang Airport otherwise the long immigration line would worsen the experience unorganized boarding and people in hot seats ended up among the last to board. Things get slightly better on the aircraft. Emergency exit “ hot seat” pretty comfortable with no other passengers next to me and I end up taking all 3 seats for myself. Pre- ordered breakfast (Pancake) is delicious great punctuality. Other than that things are pretty horrible and chaotic. Pre-ordered food on the return flight inedible rice stale meat overcooked and obviously is re-heated more than once. Drinks sold on board are lukewarm Flight attendants try to be overly friendly. Hot seat when the plane is full became unbearable for such long flight. Will avoid in the future.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
AirAsia customer review,10,2013-06-28,Air Asia Indonesia CGK-DPS. Convenient and fast. Booking process is smooth and check-in just needs a QR code and the scanner at the airport.

AirAsia customer review,1,2013-06-21,Cochin to Kuala Lumpur. Most uncomfortable flight I've been on. There is practically no leg space. Add to it the fact that I had a window seat with the other two seats filled in by slightly heavyset people and I felt like I didn't even have breathing space. It was so cramped that I didn't have space to move my hands. The choice of food on board is poor. Even when I asked for something that was on the menu they didn't have it. The only good thing was the rate but given the condition of the flight even the cheap rates do not sound tempting.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,,,1,,,False

AirAsia customer review,,2013-06-04,Flights were on time and that's about the only good thing I've experienced with this airline. Throughout my Southeast Asia journey I flew Air Asia 4 times and each time had a terrible time booking and then with customer service. Their website is a hassle to navigate and there is so many extra fees! They randomly cancel flights and rebook you without checking then when you have to rebook that flight the website doesn't work and there are no phone numbers to be found. They say they can only help you through live chat but it never works. At one point we resorted to going to the airport and talking to them where they admitted they had read out emails and just did not reply. I've never seen an airline less flyer friendly.

AirAsia customer review,7,2013-06-03,SYD-KUL was 30 minutes late but the food was okay. The only things I really did was play on my ipad because the flight was very boring. KU-SYD night flight was on time but no food or beverages. Toilets were clean on both flights and the seats look brilliant but 2 hours into the flight you can clearly see the poor padding.

AirAsia customer review,9,2013-05-26,DMK-SIN SIN-HKT HKT-DMK. DMK a joy no queues large open spaces as not many pax plenty of seats easy check in at airport with bags coming in right on the weight had paid for. Zero lines at passport control and security. Had exit row hot seats for 1st leg and they were great so much leg room. Cabin staff also enforced the seats with people trying to move in to the empty row in front of us and all were removed. Only issue was passport control in Singapore all desks open but overwhelmed with the amount of people to deal with. Only downside is with all the space and empty jetways and stands why oh why bus people to the plane? With the hot seats you get to board first but boarding the bus first does not help as its still scramble on the plane. 2nd leg to Phuket again easy check in had 'normal' seats on plane and leg room is ok but I am not the tallest guy. I think if I was taking anything longer than 2 hours I would pay for the exit row. 3rd leg Phuket airport showing its age and in dire need of a revamp. but again no issues with TAA on arrival used jet way and bags arrived quickly.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
AirAsia customer review,10,2013-05-23,Jakarta - Singapore on Friday on the 17.30 using the Red Carpet service was an enjoyable experience. Check-in was prompt and efficient and the lounge used basic but comfortable. One issue is that I had to pay for a beer which was poor as it's included in KL. A very efficient member of staff took my passport away and processed it with immigration which was good. I was accompanied through to the Departure Lounge and even accompanied across the tarmac before everyone else. Aircraft clean and comfortable and cabin crew very professional.

AirAsia customer review,,2013-05-22,"I am en route back from Singapore to Phnom Penh with Air Asia after learning much to my disgust what Air Asia means by ""point to point"" service. I flew from Yangon to Singapore and expected - to be able to get a boarding pass from Yangon to Singapore and check my bags through. I am an experienced traveler and fly constantly. When I landed in KL I was to my surprise required to go through immigration and customs in Kuala Lumpur pick up my bag check through the confusing Air Asia terminal recheck my bags and then go through the whole process to get on to Singapore. As I had bought a ticket from Singapore to Phnom Penh with only 90 minutes between flights - plenty of time for a normal carrier not for Air Asia's bizarre system - I had to change my return flight pay them $55 USD for the pleasure of spending 4 hours in the horrible Air Asia Terminal.

Whilst some of the service was good and they were generally courteous there were inconsistencies across the board. We paid for an inflight entertainment package on our last flight but did not receive it. But on one of our flights we scored a deal where we were able to upgrade to premium which was much better and the service was more frequent but still very patchy.

I guess the priority boarding was good but I'd had to pay extra for my seat allocation as well. The flight was good with friendly and helpful crew and regular updates from the flight deck.

Hence I was looking at an 8 hour flight with no food or water. It took a lot of complaining for the staff to give me a single 250 ml bottle of water to last me the entire flight!

They will push up against the seat in front and you will constantly get bumped if you're sitting in the aisle. Having to wait at LCCT is an awful experience. The public address system announcing the flights is ridiculously loud and the static is so bad that it's impossible to understand anything being announced.

Efficient boarding at both ends meant early arrival on both sectors. Had the pancake combo for breakfast. Surprised that the drink offered was water and not coffee.

Flights were on time with nothing adverse to report and a very friendly crew. What is annoying is the way AirAsia are managing to increase prices: additional fee for credit card payment additional fee for seats (I can agree to a supplement for seats with more legroom) but to have to pay an extra fee for any seat is something than even Ryanair has not (yet) considered how can you fly without a seat? Additional fee for wheelchair use (4 USD it means 16 USD for a return trip).

Most recently when AirAsia halted their KL/CMB/KL flights 14 of us were affected from 27 Feb to 5 Mar. Refund was fast even our connecting flights were refunded. Value for money.

AirAsia customer review,,2013-01-25,I am unhappy that Air Asia's transfer to Don Muang airport has not improved any of their problems they had when they used to fly from Bangkok's main airport at Suvanabumhi. The delays are the same - from the check in counters to the flight departures. Last week I waited 1 hour in the check in line - unacceptable when they are only 1 of 3 small airlines using this airport. Then you have to take a bus from the check in gate to where the plane is located almost a kilometre away on the tarmac. Changing from Bangkok's main airport was supposed to improve all these things. Also transferring from Don Muang to Survanabumhi (where all the other airlines leave from) takes a long taxi ride of around 600 baht (incl. 3 tolls). It is just not worth using Air Asia in Thailand at all! Their website often goes down during your flight booking and there is never any response when you make a customer complaint.

AirAsia customer review,7,2013-01-15,Melbourne to Singapore with a stopover in KUL. Plane was clean with comfortable lighting. The seat's pitch is not a problem but the issue lies with the amount of shoulder space between passengers. There is just not enough space if you have broad shoulders. The seats are comfortable for smaller builds only. I had to lean on one side throughout my 8 hour flight. The poor quality padding starts to present itself about 2 hours into flight. The toilets are very clean. The sandwich taste good on both legs. The attendants are friendly but firm. I can see why it is the best low cost airline because it does offer the best value.

AirAsia customer review,,2013-01-07,Following the below review of our trip from Tokyo-Sapporo the return flight Sapporo-Tokyo was cancelled leaving us with the option of travelling the following day or getting a refund. To give a refund is to shirk responsibility. Anyway I suppose low-cost travel is fine provided nothing goes wrong. If it does you're completely stuck at a foreign airport.

AirAsia customer review,4,2013-01-02,We travelled from Tokyo Narita to Sapporo-Chitose on 22 Dec. Air Asia is the usual low-cost routine - a separate terminal with no facilities bus out to the plane at the far end of the airport tight seating and generally a joyless experience. Since when did air travel become so bland and so unexciting? Our biggest disappointment was the Air Asia terminal/departure lounge at Narita airport. Once you enter after check-in you cannot leave and there are no facilities except a toilet and a small shop. We felt trapped and stuck there in a facility that resembles a hospital waiting room. This in a busy and interesting airport with an array of shops cafes etc but we were stuck in this waiting room with no forewarning and no way to leave. Anyone checking in 3 hours in advance as requested would be well advised to time it to the last minute before going through security as this departure lounge is a horrid experience. I would also add looking at the ticket prices which creep ever upwards that the only thing cheap about low-cost travel nowadays is the way you feel after using it.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,,False

AirAsia customer review,9,2012-12-28,Sydney-KUL economy class. Seamless online check in same at airport bag drop. Seats 25 over wing. On time departure (in fact a couple of minutes early) and spot on time arrival in KL. Fully loaded aircraft with lots of large family groups typical for Christmas Day. Meal was ok - probably would have been nicer if it was hotter. Staff onboard very professional without being overly friendly. Seats are a touch narrow and sitting on the aisle I was continually bumped. The aisles were like a busy thoroughfare all flight. All in all a perfect flight when taking prices etc into consideration.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,5,,,True
AirAsia customer review,,2012-12-22,Booked a return flight from Bangkok to Krabi with my wife. She was 27 weeks pregnant and we confirmed with Air Asia before flying that nothing special was required. We flew to Krabi and all was perfect. On the way back we were seated onboard for 5 minutes when a crew member asked us to leave the plane as we did not have any authorization to fly. We were left at 8.30pm in the empty airport with no solution for us to go back home.

AirAsia customer review,8,2012-12-14,Having flown Air Asia X and the domestic service on numerous occasions I have only experienced one glitch. On a return flight from Kuching to KUL the incoming flight to Kuching was almost 3.5 hours late. No explanation was offered. As a consequence I failed to catch a connecting flight from KL to Penang. The counter staff at LCCT were helpful and reissued my ticket. The only problem was that this was the last flight to Penang that evening. It was a very long day! Providing you leave 3 to 4 hours leeway if you have another flight booked generally AA are pretty good. It is really a question of value for money and AA are exceptional in this respect.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,5,,,True

AirAsia customer review,5,2012-12-05,Travelled in a group of 40 KUL-CNX on 29/11/2012. Upon arrival to LCCT the crowd at LCCT was horrendous especially during holiday season. However we managed to check in our luggage within an hour thanks to efficient ground staff who was at the counter alone. CNX-KUL on 2/12/2012. Chiang Mai airport was much more less crowded early in the morning it was only AK flight at that time but were surprised that the check in procedure took more than an hour! There were one lady at front counter one at the back helping to cut the e-boarding pass and stick the stickers to the check in luggage. We should have been checked in as a group and not 2 by 2!

We ordered some food when we booked (Pancakes and Satay) which turned out to be decent. Everything went smoothly and on time. My only grief was how tightly packed the seats are onboard. I'm 6'1"" and used to being a bit squished on airlines. These seats were the worst I'd ever been on without question.

AirAsia customer review,7,2012-11-25,Having found a promotion fare from CNX-MFM I thought I would try the latest destination out of Chiang Mai. I was interested to see why they gave up Singapore in favour of Macau. It quickly became apparent as most of the pax were in a tour group from mainland china. Standard Air Asia service although this time I booked a hotseat and had a nice chicken lasagne. Flight was 30 mins early. No jetway at MFM but the walk in fact makes getting to immigration easier. Next to the airport is a new jetfoil service to Hong Kong.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,,,5,,,True

AirAsia customer review,,2012-11-21,I could not check in online therefore did not know that luggage food and entertainment had to be pre- booked. At the airport we had to pay $240 for luggage because I had not checked in online. This holiday was purchased as a package and the flights were to be with Jetstar. The trip took too long overall with waiting time in airports but the worst part was that on the return the flight was supposed to leave Phuket at 7.30pm and was delayed until 9.30pm. Staff kept assuring us the flight to Australia would wait for us. This did not happen and the plane left before we arrived were put up in sub standard hotel for the night. Quite a long day for a 1.5 hour flight from Phuket. Not acceptable.

Pleasantly surprised at the amount of leg room was able to fully stretch my legs under the seat in front with no effort. Didn't order food.

Took advantage of the launch fares (RM 88) and can't complain about the price for a 3 hour 1200+ mile flight. LCCT was its usual mess but I have worked out my standard operating procedure so that I got to the departure hall in good time.

Arrived at airport about 30 minutes before scheduled departure time only to find that checkin stops 45 minutes before and the automatic check in machine was programmed not to check me in as I was deemed late. I checked in at the desk without any problem without checked bags. Plane was late inbound but we made up the time on the flight south. Standard AirAsia service with reasonable cabin crew. Not their latest aircraft but interior in good condition. I was lucky to be off the aircraft quickly as the skies opened and there was a short sharp downpour and anyone from the rear of the plane would have been a drowned rat as there is no jetway from AirAsia flights.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,4,,,True

AirAsia customer review,6,2012-09-09,"The check-in at KLIA LCCT was chaotic. I took the 10pm flight from KUL to PEN on 27th August (after a very good flight on AirAsia Premium from SYD). I was already web-checked in with pre-paid luggage. The main check-in sign-board directed me to R52 - but when I arrived there it was closed even though I was exactly 2 hours ahead of departure time. Every queue was choked with people. I could not see any sign on the LCD screens for baggage drop-off. Every queue had the sign ""Excess Baggage Payment"" both on the board and at the start of the queue. I approached an usher who asked ""What time is your flight?"". She did not ask me ""Have you web-checked-in?"" and ""Do you have excess baggage?"". After about 1 hour I got to the front of the queue and dropped off my bags. After that I found out that I had been sent to the wrong queue. The was a queue for express luggage posted with a waist-high sign that had been hidden by all the queuing passengers.

We went in fearing worst after reading reviews about the airline and also about the LCCT in KL. However we came back fully satisfied with AirAsia's service and the amenities offered at LCCT. You really cannot expect more for the fares on offer and it wasn't as if there was a dearth of choices. Both airline and terminals were perfectly serviceable.

Also took my own food on board was not stopped and didn't have a problem. Staff not very friendly and don't bother you at all.

AirAsia customer review,6,2012-08-20,BLR-KUL-REP. The seats are tight. If you are tall you're going to have a problem. On the short haul flights from KUL-REP it didn't bother me but from BLR-KUL which was little more than 4 hours being cramped was a bit of a problem. Make sure you weigh your bags before check-in. At the last minute I bought something which put my bag over by 5 lbs. I ended up paying close to $75 in excess baggage about the price of the ticket for going from KUL to REP. I learned you could pay before hand online for excess baggage and its more than 50% less than paying at the airport. Overall I didn't mind Air Asia for short haul flights - under 3 hours but will definitely fly a full price airline for anything long haul. I should also add that their set up at LCCT in KUL was a mess and their ground staff wasn't very friendly.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,,,3,,,True

Less than a week before going they cancelled the flight and rebooked me in a new one nearly 3 hours later. However this flight was delayed and I was too late to reach my flight. That meant I had to pay for rebooking and stay nearly 24 hours in the airport. I made a complaint to Air Asia but they would not pay because the delay was less than 2 hours.

Every small thing is an extra now! The check in was fine but that was where it went downhill. Got to the gate 30 mins before boarding time and waited and waited the incoming aircraft had not even arrived yet. After another hour still no aircraft. What was totally unacceptable was the fact there was no announcement and no-one seemed to know what was happening I even suggested they call flight operations but they didn't. The flight eventually took off almost 2 hours late. Even though I had paid for a 'hot seat' the pitch is far from adequate and it wouldn't recline.

AirAsia customer review,2,2012-07-09,The joy that was AirAsia 10 years ago when I started flying with them is no more! On my last flight the problems were so bad I'm convinced this is no longer the way for me to fly even if its on a budget airline. I've already checked in and only needed to arrive early at the airport and then drop my luggage. Unfortunately for me the AirAsia check in system was down. This resulted in very long queues and after 40 long and uncomfortable minutes they resorted to manually check-in passengers and their luggage. While all that is happening they constantly announced about the failure and asked for patience but they continued calling passengers to board flights as if everything else is working. By the time I heard the boarding announcement for my flight we were still hopelessly stuck in the queue. When I approached a ground staff I was horrified to find out that the flight was to take off as scheduled! After at least 1 hour+ of delays thanks to their own check in system's outage I had to remind AirAsia's ground staff that we weren't late because of our own doing. Finally after some frantic phone calls and after realizing at least 50% of the flight passengers are still stuck in queues waiting to check in or to drop their luggage they agreed to delay the flight by 1 hour. Also if you have to board or disembark in KL's LCCT terminal when it's raining I think you will feel very differently about AirAsia - the experience is nothing short of horrible for passengers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,,False

AirAsia customer review,2,2012-07-02,We flew from SGN-BKK return in June 2012. I flew Air Asia ten years ago and found it was a fun inexpensive airline. How things have changed! It seems Air Asia is now all about squeezing as much money as possible out of the unsuspecting passenger. I can understand budget airlines charging more for the extra space of exit row seats but to charge you $11 extra because you have a medical condition that requires an aisle seat so you can walk during the flight or the same treatment to a passenger with motion-sickness being denied a window seat is a blatant rip-off. Your seat is selected randomly by a computer and if you don't like it then you pay $11 to change it. In Bangkok I tried to call Air Asia’s office 3 times but each call dropped out while I was waiting to speak to someone. The old 10kg baggage allowance has been reduced to 7 kg. (My carry-on wheeled backpack weighs 3kg) so that means I can pack not much more than my toiletries bag and a change of underwear before I exceed the weight limit. If you book on-line checked baggage fees and insurance are added unless you “uncheck” them. Boarding in BKK was a case of “first rush first aboard”. The flight itself was fine but the entire Air Asia experience leaves a lot to be desired.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,2,,,3,,,False

When I was in the LCC terminal the ground crew were impolite and not responsive. This airline may be value for money but if you have heavy luggage this airline is not for you.

Service was good but seats were very uncomfortable as it had no proper back support. Online booking for KUL-BKI sector had us all in different seats so we had to pay again to sit together. LCCT needs to be torn down and rebuilt. The signboards and facilities are in dire need of improvement. Toilets are wet and slippery.

The monitor didn't help at all and I have a couple going to KCH queuing in front of me and a group going to Kuantan behind me. What a mess. The staff at the check-in was busy talking among themselves while my flight is 40 minutes from departure. Went into waiting hall and straight directed to plane.

Every flight was great staff were friendly and basically you pay for what you get. If you fly a budget airline and pay minimal cost for your tickets expect this and no more. For me this is my preference. My only criticism is around the minimal options for food and after pre-booking inflight entertainment and paying for it - it not being available. I believe improvements can be made in this area. Otherwise the seats facilities service is great - expect to get what you pay for and you'll be more than happy.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,5,,,True

AirAsia customer review,7,2012-05-28,KUL-HKT-KUL. Outbound flight was delayed by more than an hour due to late arrival of the plane as well as technical issues. Return flight was more pleasant and arrived about 15 mins early. It would seem that AirAsia is now deliberately splitting up passengers and seating them separately in order to encourage them to pay extra for advance seat selection. I witnessed a passenger frantically trying to re-arrange seating onboard so that his companion could be seated with him. My own companion was also seated across the aisle but we were not too bothered by that. We got excellent value for money because we booked these tickets about a year ahead at one of the sale promotions (Fare was US$ 45 return).,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,5,,,True

Before leaving Sydney I called Air Asia to purchase my inflight entertainment and was advised that due to my seat being a premium seat it came as a package. As expected was not the case when I got on the plane! Disappointing 8 hrs!

AirAsia customer review,9,2012-05-17,Another round trip from CNX to KUL. Once you know how to 'play' low cost airlines they do offer good value for money (but not always). The LCCT is getting a bit long in the tooth for the number of pax passing through but BKK immigration staff would do well to see how to handle pax properly and efficiently. I prepaid for a meal and found it to be very tasty indeed. Although they claim to have a no outside food policy onboard they don't implement this. Biggest problem with low cost carriers is the pax they carry. FA's need to be more strict (politely of course) with pax who get ready to get off long before the aircraft reaches the gate.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,4,,,True

AirAsia customer review,6,2012-05-09,CNX-KUL. I've never used a low cost airline before but the alternative on this route involved a transit in BKK so I took Air Asia for convenience more than anything else. While the bag drop was slow and the food not that good the service was fine as was the aircraft a fairly new looking A320-200. The seat was comfortable enough for a 2hr 20min flight! The flight arrived just about on time and I was through the low cost terminal in 20min; I picked a seat paid for a 25kg bag and had food. The cost still came in 65% less than the other options on this route so no complaints and I would use again for convenience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,5,,,True
AirAsia customer review,7,2012-05-07,We travel KUL-MEL almost once a month for business. Not happy with the booking system as it tries to sell you everything from Hot Seats to Baggage to Insurance etc. and every time we book we have to be careful to delete all these items as it gives you Hot seats to charge you more. Other airlines leave it to you to add on items you wan to purchase and this is more practical. They should make their booking system more User Friendly! Punctuality is ok and they have improved a lot over the years. Most of the staff are friendly.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,3,,,True

AirAsia customer review,5,2012-04-27,Flew JOG-KUL-RGN. Do not spend money on hot seat or pick a seat. Since boarding announcements are in local language first passengers rushed to the gates especially in small airports where there is not a dedicated line for hot seat passengers. When I asked staff at gate if everyone had hot seats they said yes! Pay for hot seats if you want bulk head or emergency exit seats for leg room. At end of purchase the website will give you seat assignments so don't bother paying for pick a seat either.

AirAsia customer review,8,2012-04-24,CNX-KUL return. As I seldom have checked baggage using the stand alone machines for check-in is a breeze especially as most people don't use them! Flight itself was fine although it was a confusing route march to get to the aircraft. Also having a flight to Chennai at roughly the same time seemed to confuse some passenger. Reasonable cabin crew. I ordered meals in advance and they were onboard although I was listed as a 'no-show' on the manifest. Return to CNX the breakfast pancakes were cold and trying to get the packet of maple syrup open was like a challenge from a game show.

AirAsia customer review,9,2012-04-24,SYD-KUL-SYD. A day flight so no reclined seats from the passenger in front. The space between seats was surprisingly decent. Food is average.

AirAsia customer review,3,2012-04-15,This is a bad bus service. On my travel BKK-CCU the check-in lines were ridiculous with attendants weighing every piece of baggage.

AirAsia customer review,1,2012-04-08,Our flight KUL-SGN was forced to return due to a tropical Storm in SGN. That was unavoidable so we accepted that we had no choice. However on return to the LCCT the absence of senior staff and the overall treatment of all passengers was appalling.

I had an email several weeks before departure saying that my meal choice was being discontinued and quoted the substitute meal which was quite tast).

AirAsia customer review,1,2012-02-07,Perth to KUL. My elderly mother paid extra to travel premium economy - what a waste! On both flights ground staff did not give priority boarding to premium economy passengers - everyone just barged on to the aircraft without a care for anyone else. Space between aisles was much tighter than other airlines and the seats certainly seem to be less roomier. Like a previous reviewer if you are going to have rules about luggage you must be prepared to enforce them! We had originally booked flights leaving Perth mid-afternoon and today I was informed by email that the flight had now been cancelled and we have been moved to an 8 pm flight.

AirAsia customer review,8,2012-02-01,Three flights Kolkata (CAL) to BBK and BBK-CNX return. All flights comfortable and with one exception on time. Air Asia's offer is basic but good. The seats are reasonably comfortable and better than many budget airlines. Having flown Air Asia for many years I notice the staff are not as enthusiastic as in the early days nor do they have time to interact with passengers. I wish the company would enforce their 'one carry-on bag' policy. Some passengers on one flight had up to four large bags.

FA inexperienced fairly professional but without personality. Food purchased in advance was very disappointing (both ways) and just in foil with a spoon absolutely nothing else not even salt. Food expensive for nothing. Biggest minus is the hassle with transfers where one has to vacate and re- enter the airport to sort baggage custom and immigrations for onwards travels. The airline tolerates mostly 2 pieces of hand-luggage. Inscribed luggage charged overweight if more than 1-2 kg. When purchase ticket one has to be careful not to be trapped purchasing expensive seating and superfluous insurance.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,,True
AirAsia customer review,1,2012-01-18,Flights from Perth-KL then KL to Bangkok return. 4 flights 1 was fantastic. The rest were very disappointing. Even a 3 star airline should be able to provide clean seating and toilets. We were subject to 'attitude' from staff when we complained about the chewing gum over our table dried vomit over the back of the seats in front of us and the accompanying smell. We were eventually moved. A toilet door broke because it wouldn't shut people sitting adjacent had to put up with the chemical smell.

AirAsia customer review,4,2012-01-13,Fully satisfied in the past however my last two trips were awful. Since Air Asia introduced web check-in the problem has started. My flight was to Chennai I did web check-in and arrived 2.5 hours early for baggage drop off. However the baggage drop off area was total chaos! People were cutting in between the lines without any respect for the queue. I waited in line for almost 2 hours without moving. 40 mins before departure two new counters opened for Chennai only and I managed to get my luggage dropped off 20 mins before departure. Ran for immigration but my expatriate gold card helped me pass through quickly and I boarded the flight 5 mins before departure. This has now happened to me a few times in the past when there was separate check-in counters there were no issue.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,1,,,False
AirAsia customer review,6,2012-01-11,The night before I flew from CNX I spent a good half an hour checking-in via the web for my flight. On arrival at CNX they had 3 flights departing at approximately the same time and only 3 check-in desks open. There was no Baggage Drop-Off counter for passengers who took the time to check-in online - even their self-check- in facility was out of order! I queued for 40 minutes. Not providing the facility at CNX whilst promoting its use is unreasonable and irrational. Besides this aspect of their service this flight and the previous five with Air Asia have been similarly delayed. Don't be taken in with the price sometimes it is cheaper to fly TG. All the planes I have flown are exceptionally clean and look and feel new however I regret that Air Asia is loosing its credibility and its novelty is wearing mighty thin.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,,False

AirAsia customer review,10,2011-12-09,Flew one-way KUL-LGW and managed to get standby upgrade from economy to Premium via the Optiontown service. Though notification of successful upgrade only came through via email some 8 hours before the flight. Not best but for the low price it was worth it. 14 hrs flight to LGW was fine. Food-wise there is just one main dish item for each meal service ie. no starters bread or desserts. A free bottle of water was provided with each meal (part of the Premium deal). Other soft drinks were chargeable. Not a problem if one manages one's expectations and prepares ahead accordingly. The Premium seat does indeed fold out flat but not horizontally. It tilts at an angle with head higher than the feet. It was comfortable enough and roomy. Almost full size pillows and light quilts were provided which was excellent. It was well worth getting upgraded this way (on standby via Optiontown). The total cost of the one way ticket was less than some one-way economy tickets within Europe! The entertainment console which cost RM 35 was okay. It had 6 films or so on it and some other TV programs and music. Crew were efficient. Commended. Baggage arrived fine. Will fly Air Asia X again in future.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,,True
AirAsia customer review,7,2011-08-18,HKT-CNX. Comfortable flight only marred by a group of unruly passengers. Thai crew unable to control them but then who could?

AirAsia customer review,,2011-08-17,Round trip Bangkok to Chiang Mai. The problems started trying to book the flight online. A truly painful process and ended up a much more costly experience than first expected with extras and charges you even have to pay for choosing a seat. As for the flights outwards was fine but all I can say on the return leg is - if the company uses the same guidelines of employing non customer facing staff as they do with the customer facing staff then disaster is only a matter of time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
AirAsia customer review,7,2011-08-16,MFM-BKK-HKT. Check-in was easy as I had prepaid for my luggage however I was unable to transfer my baggage at BKK and had to re-check my baggage.

AirAsia customer review,8,2011-07-03,TAA has re-timed their CNX-SIN flight and this is much better although it is a late arrival in CNX on the return sector. My flight to SIN was slightly early but the return was almost 30 mins early into CNX arriving at 2235 instead of 2300. Boarding in SIN aided this and the aircraft with 55 pax pushed back 10 mins ahead of schedule but we lost that time waiting for a slot at the end of the runway! As per usual I ate at Changi and filled my water bottle from a fountain at the gate. 30 baht for their tiny bottle of water is a rip off. Looks like TAA is eating into Silkair's customer base as the latter has dropped its prices to about 1000 baht more than TAA but them there are no add ons and you get a free meal and beer. All in all I'm starting to warm to their Changi service after an indifferent start in January.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True

AirAsia customer review,9,2011-05-28,Shopping around I found that there was an excellent promotion fare with TAA from SIN to CNX. I used this service on day one in January and hoped that they could at least get it back to CNX on time. The flight has been retimed since earlier in the year and it seems to work as the flight got into CNX 30 minutes early (as opposed to 30 mins late in January). I ate at Changi airport avoiding having to buy their overpriced meals onboard. As is usual with Air Asia the flights are pretty routine and uneventful. The check in kiosks make life very easy when having no baggage and I was able to check-in well ahead of regulation time. Thai crew were polite and efficient and I noticed that the first officer was a woman (a first for TAA?). Don't see many of them in Asia!! I'm slowly coming round to the fact that if needs must then Air Asia is a viable option provided you shop around and don't just assume that they are the cheapest because they say they are. Disappointed to see that the fuel surcharge is back for my June trip to Singapore! The other problem I have with them is that in allowing 'everyone to now fly' they allow people to do so who frankly shouldn't be allowed out of their living rooms and have no idea of how to behave when travelling or worst of all why the crew handed out immigration cards before landing.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
AirAsia customer review,9,2011-04-24,RGN-BKK-RGN. Check in at Yangon International Airport hassle free. Flight call by seat boarding fine greeted by smiles and seated behind the emergency exit row.

AirAsia customer review,5,2011-02-22,BKK to Hat Yai (HDY) and noticed service deterioration. Flight retimed one month in advance and cause me minor itinerary problem (despite their offer to change to earlier or later flight). Only one Bag drop counter for internet/ Kiosk check in opened. Their advertisement that internet check in is quicker and hassle - free is totally untrue. Once on board A320 aircraft is new and clean but seat pitch is a very tight. Aptitude of the crew does not seemed to be as good as their earlier year.

AirAsia customer review,5,2011-01-26,Took the inaugural flight from Chiang Mai to Singapore. To say it was just another flight would be an understatement. And it was 30 minutes late which is about par for the course with Thai AirAsia. No apology for being late. Their slogan is 'newest planes newest routes'. Well it wasn't their newest plane which was delivered in time for the start-up of the SIN service. Judging by the crowds assembled in SIN for the return journey it looks like they are marketing the flight at the SIN end. There was no hype at CNX and I haven't seen any media coverage of the fact that the flight has now started. Most of the passengers were non-Thai. Standard Air Asia service. I cant believe they charge 30 baht for a small bottle of bottle. If you get a promotional fare its good value otherwise shop around. Having done PR for major events including such new services I was sorely disappointed. Frankly Thai Ai Asia's product is far below that of its big brother in Malaysia and it shows.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
AirAsia customer review,6,2011-01-20,"HKT-BKK. Online check-in down for several days. Attempting to check-in with a mobile proved both costly and fruitless until the day I was actually due to depart. I visited the Air Asia office on Thaweewong Road Patong a few days prior to departure and was informed that there had been a bomb scare at their offices which had negatively impacted their booking system but I didn't find anything on local news media to substantiate that claim. When I eventually did get the 2D barcode image on my mobile Air Asia's scanners at Phuket International appeared unable to read it. Fortunately there wasn't a queue at the Web Check-in desk and they were able to print the boarding pass for me instead. The flight departed 50 mins late but I had allowed ample time to my connecting flight to Dubai. But I would advise anyone proposing to fly with Air Asia where there is a connecting international flight to consider to allow ample time because flight delays and even cancellations are the order of the day on Thai Air Asia. On arrival at BKK a further delay of about 45 mins occurred because as I was informed by an airport employee Air Asia didn't have any staff to offload the luggage from the plane. Price wise when you add in all the add-ons together with the ""Convenience Fee"" the latter of which is the credit card charge there's not a lot of difference in price between Air Asia and there nearest rival Bangkok Air.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False

AirAsia customer review,9,2010-10-20,CGK-HKT. The flights were on time aircraft very clean and well-maintained and service was very friendly and professional. I paid a small supplement for one of the 'hotseats' and it was well worth it. The return ticket cost around USD100 (promo fare) including add-ons and extras. Excellent value for money. The problem with Air Asia seems to be actually managing to get these promo fares. They are advertised heavily on the website but when you try to make a booking very often only the regular fares come up. I think you need to book far in advance as I did with this ticket. Their regular fares are often only a bit cheaper than other carriers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True

AirAsia customer review,9,2010-09-21,BKK-CAN and HKG-BKK. My first experience of Thailand's division of Air Asia. Good value for money and only a few observations. Having paid for a 'hot seat' the priority boarding in BKK was only to the bus not the plane. There were just two of us so everyone else piled on which meant we were actually one of the last on to the aircraft. The other is the price of the soft drinks which are frankly a rip-off. Flights on-time and one of the aircraft was virtually brand new. If the price is right this is the way to go but they are not always the cheapest option especially to Hong Kong where competition is fierce with a multitude of third country carriers flying that route.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
AirAsia customer review,9,2010-09-13,BKK - Phnom Penh - BKK Checked in online 24hours in advance which was very convenient and got seats allocated together Airport baggage drop very quick and efficient. Flight departed 15minutes early and arrived 25minutes early. seats comfortable legroom ok for a lo-cost carrier. baggage very quick on arrival. Return journey checked in at the desk very quick and efficient. Although flight was only 1/3 full we didn't get seated together and were put across the aisle from each other despite the two seats next to me where empty. Flight on time and arrived early baggage again very quick.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
AirAsia customer review,8,2010-08-21,Bangkok - Yangon - Bangkok. I bought the ticket on internet. The process was a bit time consuming as I had to click through many pages. The 48 hours web check in was very convenient as I could check in on both flights. But still I had to go to the check-in counter at the airport for document check. Check in at Bangkok was long. I only had a handbag and I was directed to a counter for that purpose. Service was good. I am 1.81 and found the seat spacing adequate. There was a wide variety of food options which could be ordered when the ticket was purchased. Cabin staff professional and friendly on both flights. My only complaint is that on the return flight a PRM (Person with Reduced Mobility) was seated between me and the aisle (I had a window seat). I don't think this is legal and it caused discomfort for the other person.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
