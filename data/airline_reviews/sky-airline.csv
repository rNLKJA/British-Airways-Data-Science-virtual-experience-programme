"""crew was attentive """,9,2015-10-03,"I flew from Santiago de Chile to Punta Arenas. Sky Airline offers only Economy Class seating. The fight from Santiago to Punta Arenas makes a regular but short stop in Puerto Montt. For a low-cost airline compared to South American standards, Sky Airline was quite good. The crew was attentive throughout the flight. The pilot even mentioned when we flew over the famous Torres del Pain national park in Patagonia. We were served drinks on both legs of the flight. Seat comfort is okay for short to medium distances. Also, they don't have any IFE or wifi connection available on their Airbus fleet. However, I would definitely fly again with Sky Airline since it's great value for money.",False,A319,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Santiago de Chile to Punta Arenas,September 2015,3,4,,4,5,,True,
Sky Airline customer review,3,2015-08-07,"Normally it is really hard for people over 6'8 ft tall to fit into economy seats. Therefore, we ask the airlines for emergency seats. However, Sky Airline is one of those airlines that gives these type of seats to anyone, but not to those who actually need them. This is how my short, really uncomfortable trip started. No entertainment aboard provided at all, even the airline doesn't allow the passenger to use any electronic device in the entire flight. My food was a small sandwich and a soda, normal plane food. Once we arrived at the airport, we had to wait over an hour to receive our bags. According to the airline, ""They didn't have much workers to give us our bags earlier"". The worst part of it, is that they have this huge logo in every plane saying that they were granted the Skytrax Award as a best airline.",False,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,La Serena to Santiago,July 2015,1,2,,1,3,,False,
Sky Airline customer review,8,2015-01-25,"SCL-PUQ-SCL via PMC both ways. Airbus 319s in decent condition. The plane on the outbound journey was second-hand from EasyJet - there was orange on the overhead bins the EasyJet upholstery design on the (very cramped) seats and even a random ""Thank you for flying EasyJet"" pre-recorded announcement that came on. Each segment came with complementary meal service so we had four meals on the round-trip which weren't amazing but were mostly edible. Beverage service includes wine and pre-mixed pisco sour but no beer. Staff was courteous but not noticeably welcoming. Don't let the pretty awful website give you the wrong impression Sky seems to be a fine airline that got us and our luggage where we needed to be in the promised time at less than half the cost of LAN.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Sky Airline customer review,9,2014-12-31,We flew from P.Arenas to Santiago last Sunday (21/12/2014 leaving at 6am) online check-in was easy (we had to print the boarding pass) baggage drop off as well. The crew were nice and they served us breakfast (cake hot drink yoghurt and cereals) at 7am and then again at 9.30am with a hot croissant hot drink yoghurt and juice.

Sky Airline customer review,9,2014-04-09,I used this airline for a trip from Concepcion to Punta Arenas via Perto Montt then returned to Santiago via Perto Montt. In my years of travel I have not had such a smooth comfortable and overall pleasing trip. The A319-100 was clean the cabin service was polite and helpful and the food was good. Of course any airline that serves Chilean wine is doing a good thing. My trip to Santiago could have been stressful in that those who purchased the tickets for my party of eight had erred in making our final destination back to Concepcion. Sky changed our itinerary with no challenge and even made luggage allowances to our favor. I would recommend this airline and will use it when I return to Chile in the fall.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,True,
Sky Airline customer review,9,2014-03-19,CCP-SCL-CJC and return with a stopover in CPO on the return flight. All segments operated by A319-100 aircraft. Top-notch service on every single sector with complimentary food and drinks. Whereas the main competitor LAN is apparently cutting costs at all edges yet serving only a piece of cake in a plastic wrap or a minuscule bag of peanuts and raisins on national routes Sky still manages to spoil its passengers with a more than adequate snack that usually includes a sandwich a delightfully filled puff roll or pasta with fresh ham a fruit salad a piece of cake bread and some chocolate. We were welcomed aboard their aircraft with a candy which was nice. Departure and arrival always on time or ahead of schedule with no problems regarding baggage which was always delivered promptly. The flight attendants could have been more smiley except for one who stood out providing a very warm service. However they were no grumpier than on other airlines. Aircrafts had been acquired from EasyJet and their onboard equipment is thus basic but they are all in an excellent condition. Considering the airfares and the product delivered Sky Airline has become a competition that LAN Airlines needs to take more than seriously.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,5,,True,
Sky Airline customer review,8,2012-03-02,Lome-Abidjan Business Class. I flew this short 60 min flight from Lome (Togo) to Abidjan (Ivory Coast). The transit time at this small airport was approximately 1 hour. Boarding went smoothly. The bus dropped us of at the stairs (approximately 100m from the gate). My seat was 1D on a Boeing 737 New Generation. All business class seats were configured 2x2 and were all leather. Announcements were made and manual safety instructions shown. Take off was smooth. At cruising level the cabin service started and a warm meal was offered. Soon after tables where cleared and cabin prepared for landing. All in all a very pleasant experience.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Sky Airline customer review,7,2012-01-21,Departure on time from Santiago to Punta Arenas. 2 stop-overs are too many for such a flight in Puerto Montt and in Balmaceda. Onboard service is fine. We asked for a blanket without any problem. Food service ok. Snacks and beverage between each stop-over. Cheep flights. Flight schedule respected. I recommend it if you allow yourself an entire day to fly from Santiago to Punta Arenas!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Sky Airline customer review,7,2011-01-02,Santiago to Puerto Montt return. Flights on time service efficient and polite although not over the top. Aged B737-200 well over 20 years old but that is one of the reason I selected Sky. For the cost can't really go wrong and would recommend for anyone who either is price conscious or loves flying different aircraft.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Sky Airline customer review,2,2010-01-26,Santiago to Punta Arenas via Perto Montt. Sky Airline has 8 ageing Boeing 737-200s flying mainly internal routes including this relatively long haul to the tip of Chile. Check-in was smooth and efficient and the booked seats (on the left of the plane to see the Andes chain) were delivered. But after that things unravelled. The incoming plane from Concepcion was 1.5 hours late; the weather at Concepcion was blamed. But LanChile had no problems! No announcements were made; all enquiries had to be requested individually from the occasional ground staff at the gate. Take-off was 2 hours late. No apologies; just a take it or leave it approach. The all-Economy cabin is very cramped. Meal service was poor. Only an inedible pasta; the chicken option had all gone by the time the troley had reached me in Row 7. One of the flight attendants was surly and rude but her colleague tried to cover over her dreadful attitude. The only reason to use Sky Airline is that it is cheap; of your budget can run to it use LanChile; far more professional.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Sky Airline customer review,,2007-05-08,We flew from Santiago de Chile to Calama and return and had a good flight. Crew attentive and service good. One of us wanted an extra glass of wine and no problem there either. On arrival a piece of luggage was missing but has been returned the very same day by Sky to our hotel 100km further in San Pedro de Atacama.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
