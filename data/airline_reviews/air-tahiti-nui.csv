"""Business Class product was terrible""",1,2022-10-19,"Their lack of care, lack of support and lack of customer service is monumental. My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and heading to Bora Bora. Air Tahiti from LAX to Papeete and then on Air Tahiti (regional carrier) to Bora Bora. About 2 hours prior to our late night flight, Air Tahiti Nui cancelled the flight. The reason was that the incoming aircraft was struck by lightning. Understanding that safety is paramount and absolutely the most important factor of traveling, we understood that the aircraft had to be inspected. Keep in mind that Air Tahiti Nui only has like 4 aircraft in their fleet so it's not like they can quickly bring in a new aircraft. We were shuttled to an airport hotel at LAX and told to come back in the next day as the flight would now depart at 2pm. Back to LAX we went and learned that Air Tahiti Nui kept delaying the flight with no information or communication to the passengers. When a Gate Agent did appear, we were advised that they are third party employees and have no further details. All this while we were watching tape being put on the front of the aircraft where it was struck by lightning. After hours again in LAX, the flight finally departed. Upon arrival in Tahiti there was no one from Air Tahiti Nui to provide hotel vouchers (as the majority of passengers were connecting to neighboring islands and there were no regional flights out that late). There was a line of about 200+ passengers waiting for some assistance from one woman sitting in the Air Tahiti office! After hours of waiting we were put up in literally a dump of a motel for the night. Knowing that the flight was cancelled the previous day, why would they not have staff ready to assist their passengers as well as hotel vouchers for those stuck in Papeete. Take my recommendation, fly an alternate carrier if going to Tahiti. Their Business Class product was terrible. 2x2x2 seating on a 787 where others offer plenty more room. Inflight entertainment was very limited and food was ""just OK' but nothing I would expect from a flag carrier. Internet never worked and while flight attendant service was very cordial, it certainly does not make up for their lack of customer service.

"""I would look elsewhere""",1,2020-02-13,"This was the first time flying Air Tahiti Nui.  My goal was to fly from LAX to PPT (Tahiti) then PPT to BOB (Bora Bora). The nightmare started on our flight from LAX to PPT. Discovered Air Tahiti Nui does not have a designated ticket counter so you can only check in 2 hours before flight departs. This caused an issue because in order to gain access to any club lounge you need a boarding pass. Our flight arrived in LAX about 5 hours before the LAX to PPT departed so had to sit and wait in LAX for 3 hours until Air Tahiti Nui ticket counter opened. By that time there was a long line of people and the staff at Air Tahiti Nui did not seem to care how fast they processed people. So we were not able to go to our lounge and eat and relax so we had to pay for our lunch and stand around because of very limited seating in the lobby of LAX. After checking our bags we went to the gate displayed on my ticket and on the overhead boards and on my flight app. Several people started going up the the gate ticket counter asking why boarding had not started with only 10 minutes before our flight was suppose to depart. No answers. Staff simply did not seem to care. Five minutes before boarding an announcement was made of a gate change to 153 which was about 1/2 mile away all the way down to the other end of the concourse.

This was imperative because we had a shuttle service in Paris who had our initial arrival time and had to wait for us. Anyway, we boarded the aircraft and noticed that our economy seats were very small and tight. For an 11 hour flight, these seats were terribly tiny and uncomfortable. The inflight entertainment was very limited. The movie selection was limited and there wasn't a variety of genres. The positive aspect of this airline was the service. The attendants aboard the flight were efficient, responsive, cooperative, and professional. I can't think of anything else to say about the staff. The food onboard the flight was just like your generic airline food. It was cold, slimy, and disgusting. I recommend purchasing food and snacks prior your flight in the terminal.

"""recommend avoiding Air Tahiti Nui""",2,2016-08-02,"✅ Verified Review |  I would recommend avoiding Air Tahiti Nui. Our outbound flight from the US was uneventful. The plane, however, was in poor shape, with threadbare carpet, outdated seatback entertainment (some flights don't even have screens), sagging seatback pockets and below average food and service. The flight was on-time, though, and we were headed to paradise, so we could overlook these minor issues, even though the flight cost, even for an economy ticket, was at a premium price point. On our return trip is where we ran into serious issues. There was a mechanical delay on our flight, which postponed our departure for 24 hours. We waited in line for 3 hours before we had the delay and rebooking information, however, and were told that there was no possibility of being moved to one of the three other PPT-LAX flights that Air Tahiti Nui had before our rescheduled flight left. They put us up in a nice hotel overnight, so we weren't too upset at spending another day in Papeete. We had booked all of our ongoing flights out of LAX on our own due to my wife and I parting ways after the trip and her complicated international travel. Upon getting to the hotel, I began the process of rebooking all of those flights, as we were given the new departure information the following night. After breakfast the following morning, we were feeling pretty good about everything, when I just happened to check the Air Tahiti Nui website to see if our flight was still on time. Nope, we were delayed another 9 hours, which then caused us to miss all of our rebooked connections from LAX. We did not receive any notification from the airline about this additional delay. At this point, Air Tahiti Nui really let us down. They did not rebook us on any of the other departing flights for LAX. They had no consideration for connecting flights. In order for my wife to make her destination in time, we had to reroute her on another Air Tahiti Nui flight to Tokyo-Narita. They would not apply any of the funds we used for the PPT-LAX flight, nor would they simply book her on that flight at no cost due to the mechanical issue. When we spoke to customer service, we had to find all of our own solutions due to their incompetence and lack of understanding. To top it all off, they were completely indifferent and unapologetic. To this day, almost one month later, we have not been engaged by their customer service department for reparations after repeated emails and phone calls. Based on our experience, I would recommend a few things: There are other carriers that fly to/from Tahiti (Air France, Hawaiian Air, etc). Look into them and see if they are an option for you. Take a vacation somewhere else. There are a lot of nice spots in the world, and while Tahiti is exotic and amazing, our poor air travel and all that followed totally clouded our experience. If you still decide to go, and to go with Air Tahiti Nui, try to book all of your air travel through them on one ticket. Or, if you are booking your own connections, be sure to have some flexibility on your US arrival (a day or two in LA on the back end).",False,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,PPT to LAX,July 2016,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",3,1,,,False

There is a lot of leg room which makes it easy when seats are upright to move about. As we needed to try to sleep, we did not use the inflight entertainment. The cabin was fresh and clean, slightly better than our outward aircraft on 16 December, although that one was fine too (Moorea). These were both night flights and therefore we didn't have much contact with the cabin crew, but they were pleasant, polite and efficient although perhaps not quite so at ease with passengers as we have found on bigger international airlines.

A standard roller bag carry on will not fit in the overhead compartment wheels first and had to be placed sideways. They don't really weigh your carry on at check in but the weight amount of 22 lbs is generous. They didn't weigh or even notice our backpacks. The tray tables were dirty the bathrooms were not kept up during flight and the seats/floor were stained throughout the cabin. I brought Clorox wipes after reading prior reviews to clean off our seating area and felt better after doing so. The amenities were nice such as the overnight flight kit pillows and blankets which were a pleasant feature. The food was not very good at all cold and soggy. The best bet is to bring something such as a Powerbar if you are a picky eater. The movies on the plane were of a good selection but when flying overnight you don't have much time to watch a movie if you are trying to rest. The flight was bumpy both ways but the pilot was considerate in not keeping the seat belt light on for an over-extended period of time. My suggestion is to ask at check in if there are two seats together to transfer to if you are stuck in the row of four you will be much more comfortable. Row 43 (a row of 4) in the back has in seat tray tables so you can't lift the armrest if traveling with a companion and this is not noted anywhere even on Seat Guru. The airport in Papeete is under construction and it took over 2.5 hours for the two planes that arrived at the same time to clear passport control which made us miss the ferry to Moorea.

Air Tahiti Nui customer review,4,2014-04-06,Flew LAX to PPT and back for an Oceania Cruise. Going to PPT things were just OK. After all you are heading to paradise so it's easier to overlook less than friendly service uncomfortable seats and marginal food. Our return flight was a charter arranged by the cruise line and things were much worse. They had little or no ice limited beverage options and the food was awful. The flight attendants just don't have any spark to them. Some of that may be a cultural thing because I find customer service in FP to be less warm and inviting than in Europe or the US. This airline needs to really punch up their customer service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,3,,,False
Air Tahiti Nui customer review,2,2014-03-26,I flew round trip to Papeete for a Paul Gauguin cruise. I will never fly that airline again. This is unfortunate for French Polynesia because it is a wonderful place and I loved my time there the the flight was unbearable. The seats are so small with no leg room so that one can hardly move.

Air Tahiti Nui customer review,4,2014-02-05,A 5-hour flight from Auckland to Papeete (Business Class) was more or less ruined by a seat that wouldn't budge from the takeoff/landing bolt upright position and a fold out tray that didn't. The whole aircraft was looking very tired and tatty and badly in need of an upgrade. The Air Tahiti staff at the chaotic boarding gate in Auckland were rude and condescending although the flight attendants did the best they could in such a worn out old bus. Food was OK (I don't expect cordon bleu on a plane) but the wine choice was one cheap red or white. Take it or leave it. Entertainment was very limited too. I was told that of a fleet of 5 aircraft 4 have in fact been upgraded. I guess I found myself on the one that wasn't. Assuming the final aircraft is in fact given the major facelift it so badly needs then I'd consider using Air Tahiti Nui again as a last resort but will take Air New Zealand if it's an available alternative.,False,,,Business Class,,,1,3,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,2,,,False

Air Tahiti Nui customer review,1,2014-01-08,Air Tahiti Nui economy class is awful - very tight cramped seats if you are tall as we are poor service and minimal cardboard food. Our section of the cabin was an oven the section behind us was a refrigerator and the cabin attendants seemed to be unable to do anything about it when you could find one to ask. My husband who is 6 ft’3”was wedged into his seat to the point that the woman in front of him and the woman behind him both complained when he moved and he was unable to sleep at all. We upgraded to first class on the way home and the leg room service and food were very good but they still locked the forward toilets for most of the flight and half the reading lights did not work.

Air Tahiti Nui customer review,,2014-01-06,Very poor service at LAX from Air Tahiti staff. Flying business class on AA with a code share. They are having some dispute with AA so AA and Air Tahiti are refusing to let each other's business class passengers into their lounges but they don't tell you until you get to the lounge. With three small children and already on flights for 12 hours with a 6 hour stopover in LAX they refused us entry to the Lounge. The staff in the Lounge were kind. Air Tahiti wouldn't let us pay for the lounge without first going out of security again waiting 30 minutes for them to process the payment and receipts and then line up in security all over. Apparently they used to let people phone in the credit card number to avoid having to exit security but now they have decided they rather make passengers spend over an hour at their desk/security.

Air Tahiti Nui customer review,9,2013-11-18,Excellent service from the flight crew and ground crew. We arrived at LAX with minutes to spare as our inbound flight was delayed 2+ hours. That airline made no effort to put us on another flight. Running all the way from Terminal 1 to Bradley searching for the ATN desk the kind young lady escorted us swiftly to the gate. We just made the flight otherwise would have spent the night in LA. Although our bags didn't make it they were delivered the next day to our hotel. Since we had no luggage when we arrived the airline gave us a nice bag with essential toiletries including T-shirt and shorts which we all sported for the next few hours. The meals were better than expected the in-flight entertainment was better than some major U.S. airlines.

Air Tahiti Nui customer review,3,2013-11-10,"Flew to Auckland from Papeete. The flight was 5 hours long. I was seated in 6a wonderful smells of the toilet behind us. I found cabin staff rude and unfriendly. They closed business class toilet and told everyone to use the ones in the middle of the plane. They dropped food on my lap while serving bread didn't say sorry but offered me another one. Seats are average for business class and food is terrible. They were ""out"" of mains when they came to serve us (being in row 6). You do not get additional drinks and if you go and ask for some it's an inconvenience to the staff without a smile or polite conversation. I might sound picky but I am simply wanting something nicer than economy when you pay twice as much for a ticket. The entertainment gave you 8 new movies and a few old titles and tv programs.

Air Tahiti Nui customer review,3,2013-09-26,We flew from LAX to Papeete and back. We were in a recently remodelled plane but the seats were terrible. They were tightly packed with very little leg room which is the norm. However the back was curved into a concave shape which was agony on a 8.5 hour flight. The headrests exacerbated the problem and my wife's wouldn't even stay up. The cushions were also stiff. There was no power outlet for the seats.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,2,,,False
Air Tahiti Nui customer review,10,2013-09-25,Fight from LAX to PPT. After a full day of US flights from RDU to MSP to LAX we were quite exhausted. A couple of those flights were late and the older planes were packed. So we were hoping for a change of pace on our 8.5 hour flight from LAX to PPT - and we were not disappointed! The A349 was impeccable. We were in coach but the seats were roomy the flight staff was extremely friendly and we had brand new inflight entertainment systems (I think the entire cabin had recently been redone). The experience got our first trip to French Polynesia off to a great start. Yeah it's still tough to sleep in coach seats but the great experience made it bearable. And of course there's nothing like waking up having a good French breakfast and landing in Tahiti with the anticipation of a luxurious vacation ahead!

Entertainment screen control did not work properly - also controls overhead reading light. We were skipped for our dinner initially. Attendant seemed bothered that we asked for dinner. Dinner was inedible. Cold slices of meat hard as shoe soles bread that could not be cut. Asked for Diet Coke was told only water was available. Arrived in LAX 15 minutes late. Still had 3 hours to make our connection to DFW. Over an hour before our luggage was available to go through customs. Because we could not check the luggage in PPT had to carry our luggage from the International terminal to AA.

Air Tahiti Nui customer review,2,2012-11-22,My luggage was received two days late in Papeete. Reason: The aircraft was already overloaded when my connection flight from Sydney arrived Auckland. My luggage remained in Auckland that day. On arrival in Papeete there was no assistance at all to passengers without luggage. There was only one person (for about 30 passengers) recording the missing luggage and it took after a late arrival another two hours before we could leave the airport to get some sleep. There was no apology from the airline. The return flight was four hours delayed and the waiting time in Papeete airport was hell. We had to pay for very expensive airport food. WIFI connection did not work and informing relatives about late arrival was impossible. There was little to no information on the reason and what the measures would be and no help from the ground staff. It almost appeared like a cover up. We missed our connecting flights and had later been booked to other flights. Again information was not available from the cabin crew during the flight and only in Auckland we where told to what connecting flight we had been re-booked. A very troublesome check out and check in with going through the immigration twice in Auckland had to be endured.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,2,,,False

Don't know if the airline or LAX is to blame there. Once boarding started we were put on buses to go to a satellite boarding point. Main terminal under construction. Inconvenient but it works. Onboard cabin staff were friendly and helpful. First time on an A340. Once in the air the flight went smoothly. The plane was clean. The 2 meals served were adequate in size and somewhat above average as far as airline food goes. Service was good. A red-eye flight in economy class seats is not going to produce quality sleep. The seats were about as comfortable as you would expect which isn't saying an awful lot. Entertainment system was marginal.

Air Tahiti Nui customer review,2,2012-05-31,Seats are showing some wear and tear. Torn at points and armrest cover hinges feel stuck at times. The entertainment controls on the armrest are worn-out yet still functional. Adjustment of seats: they lack sufficient recline. Controls are placed at hip level inside the chair so poorly accessible. Putting 2 pillows under your feet to raise them makes it better but raising the feet with a pillow will put your toes up against the back of the reclined seat in front of you. I deliberately chose a middle section seat this allows you to always exit without climbing over or being climbed over. The seat rows are that close together that undisturbed passing is impossible. The lumber supports do not work on this flight. Flight entertainment system is Archaic. You don't have the option of starting your movie on demand. The quality of the LCD screen is best described as a snowy CRT up close. The movies continue during PA announcements and since all are continuously playing there is no chance of rewinding. There are no air vents above the seat only general air conditioning. No power output in business class. This is consistent with the age of the seats. Sufficiently equipped courtesy pouch with toothbrush and paste eye covers ear plugs and socks. Headphones supplied are comfortable for the first couple of hours. There was simply no noise cancellation. Service is attentive and correct although the personal touch was missing the second flight.

Air Tahiti Nui customer review,8,2012-04-27,LAX-PPT in Business Class. Business Class departure lounge in LAX shared with several other airlines. Nice lounge with free snacks and drinks. Boarding gate was a bit far away we were bussed to the aircraft. First and Business Class customers were boarded in a separate bus. Once onboard - very comfortable. Before take-off drinks offered. Several uniform changes during the 8.5 hour flight. Our flight left LAX on time. As previously noted - business class seats do not fully recline and when you do recline - it protrudes in to the space of the person sitting behind you. Not the best lay out - but certainly adequate.

Air Tahiti Nui customer review,8,2012-01-11,LAX-PPT-LAX over Christmas and New Year. Both trips were red-eyes. Outbound from LAX check-in was cheerful and set the tone for the journey. On the down side passengers are bussed to the aircraft and ATN staff lost complete control of the process resulting in a scrum to get on the busses. Onboard we passed on the meal offering and slept. The hot breakfast was welcome. Arrivals Hall was chaos and a 1 hour delay to get through Immigration awaited us. Returning the Departures Area is new spacious but very warm. Boarding went well as our seats were in Row 44 we made our way to the desk 10 minutes before boarding to avoid the chaos we experienced outbound at LAX. Once again pleasant and efficient crew. In summary our flights were good the only warning I would make is that in Economy the seat pitch is only 31 inches and on an 8 hour flight if you are over 6 ft tall this is not comfortable at all.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,,,3,,,True
Air Tahiti Nui customer review,3,2011-11-05,Flying 3/4 times every year since 2008 my last experience was very disappointing. Besides domestic there is no traffic during the day at Papeete Faaa airport and then late at night they schedule 3 international flights all due to leave within a short hour and this airport can't handle it. I arrived 4 hours before departure and the line for check-in immigration and luggage check were endless. I was booked on TN8 seat 11A to Paris via LAX and after pulling out we came back to the parking stand because of an engine problem. We were told it would take an extra 3 hours to change it. They decided to serve us the light cold snack. The previous times I flew we used to have a full hot meal with wine it is obvious ATN is cutting costs and service. Finally airborne 4 hours behind schedule we were expecting to be served a round of drinks but nothing on this 8 hours flight until an hour before touching down in LAX they served us breakfast. The 11 hour flight to Paris went without problem but no round of water or drinks served between lunch and breakfast.

While others could check 2 pieces of luggage free we were allowed only one. We had been told to expect seats that were roomier with more leg room than other airlines but we were as crowded as on any low-cost airline.

The service agents stood there and looked at you but had no answers. This was a horrible experience. The best part of the night was when the Air New Zealand crew showed up.

Air Tahiti Nui customer review,1,2010-10-10,"CDG to LAX. The cabin was very cramped and hot throughout the flight but service and food was quite good and a real surprise after our experience on the ground. We arrived two hours ahead of time at CDG. After it took over an hour (about 75 minutes) to check in we then got in line next to go through security. After waiting about 30 minutes and becoming very concerned about them shutting the doors before we got through I asked the now idle check-in people if there was a way to get us through so we would not miss the flight. The manager very dismissively told us to get to the back of the line there was nothing he could do. After another 20 minutes with a security agent telling us to just have an airline rep walk us to 1st class line and being told again by the to just go back to the end of the line a security agent walked us to another area and through 1st class line. We were very surprised when we got onboard to see the same inept and rude people who did check-in were the first class and business class stewards.

Air Tahiti Nui customer review,,2010-07-14,"Basically I can confirm the other reviewers of this inept airline management. We were scheduled to fly on a Friday morning in June 2010 and were called by Air Tahiti Nui the night before saying there was a strike in Paris and to check the web site for updates on the flight. So we did the strike was a Civil strike in French Polynesia not Paris. Anyway we checked all night with no updates so travelled on the shuttle bus to the airport as scheduled. We stood in line for an hour to checkin before they opened the desks. Queued for another 30 mins to get to the front of the line at which point we were told to go and speak to ""that guy over there"". He told us the Paris flight was cancelled shrugging his shoulders and casting his eyes anywhere but us. He gave us a piece of paper and said to call the number. He was very dismissive and unhelpful. We did and were told initially they would book us on another airline. 10 minutes later they said they were no longer booking anyone on another airline. At which point they said we can either get a refund and get our own flights at another airline ticket desk (at now exorbitant rates) or we could wait and see if a Tahiti Nui flight would leave the next day. Maybe. They claimed all Air France flights were full. There were no offers of help. They refused to put us up in a hotel because we were ""local"" (we live 60 miles from LAX). We basically had to take the refund and get our own flights. We did get a direct flight with Air France at 9pm. It was a 777 and was basically empty.

We did not have seats on Air France as promised and we were told to wait for the Air Tahiti rep who did not show up until 6:30 am. I told her that Air Tahiti had promised us seats on air france due to a medical emergency and she said ""I didn't work yesterday and I cannot help you"" and slammed the door in my face.

Air Tahiti Nui customer review,3,2010-04-27,Once on the plane it was great but ground team was horrible and inept. We boarded at LAX for CDG and were amazed at the lack of urgency or customer concern. As the plane sat empty and the gate agent sat talking on her cell phone we all looked on amazed. 45 minutes after we were scheduled to board she announced we would be boarding 15 minutes late due to the plane arriving late - although it had been parked at the gate for hours as we waited. Clearly she had not looked at a clock. This caused us to depart over an hour late. Unfortunately we were on this trip during the Iceland Volcano Eruption. Air Tahiti once again proved how little they cared. I called the airlines 3 times about a flight only to be hung up on by the attendent. Once we had a flight we were told to be at the Airport 4 hours ahead of time due to the challenge from the Volcano. We arrived 4 hours early but the agents did not. We all (350 of us) waited in line. When they did show up it took them 45 minutes to get ready have coffee chat laugh joke and enjoy themselves all in front of us without any communication with us. Zero urgency or concern for all of us who had been waiting days to get on a plane. Once ticketed we went to the gate plane was there flight crew was there but not gate agents for hours we waited until they showed up and even longer while they organized themselves. It was like a circus show watching them. The whole ordeal was so ridiculous and unnecessary. The ground team has no care or concern or urgency for the passenger. I will never fly this airline again.

About a few months after booking ATN sent me an e-mail with cancellation of the return flight due to a commercial decision. Because this is not a daily route I had to change both my outbound and inbound flight and either a domestic flight in New Zealand. No online check-in and advanced seat allocation possibility. Check-in both in Auckland and Papeete slow: few counters and long rows. Cabin crew friendly and well dressed with Tiare flowers in their hair. Decent food each seat has a PTV but no AVOD. Pretty cramped leg room. Once on the French Polynesian islands I was not able to change my return flight to Auckland with my standard Y fare which I don't understand. Overall the booking system and ground service are a bit outdated (still need to reconfirm flights) but in the aircraft you will have a small Tiare flower behind your ear and a smile on your face because this is an airline that flies to a very exotic location.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True

Air Tahiti Nui customer review,1,2009-12-31,AKL-PPT-LAX. Horrible flight horrible service. Very slow check in and cramped seats. Service and food on flight fine. However arrived in LAX and they had lost my luggage. Waited 3 hours at the baggage carousel because attendents were disorganized kept walking away and not returning and they had no counter (or system it seems) to handle lost baggage. I was told unclaimed bags were just thrown on the carousel for the next flight coming in and that I should wait around to see if my bags arrived on another flight. Took 5 days to receive my bags. Air Tahiti Nui baggage line never answered my calls went to an answering machine and I left several messages. I only received a call 3 days later saying they had found my bags and they would arrive at my door the next day - which they did not. Wasted 2 days waiting at home for bags that didn't arrive. Finally received my luggage and called to claim my $65 compensation. I couldn't get this either and was told conflicting advice about having to fax someone or having to wait until I got back to Auckland. I was also told that my 2 hour layover was not enough time for the airport in Tahiti to transfer bags to a new plane. Since I had the same layover on the way back I called reservations to see what could be done so I didn't have the same problem on the way back to Auckland - flight change pay for an upgrade mark my bags as priority (I would have been happy with any advice they could give). During this conversation I was talked at instead of listened to treated rudely and the end result was that I was told there was nothing they could do and I shouldn't be so negative. I was told I shouldn't call them anymore. Apparently one phone call is considered harassment. All in all very bad flight and awful service. Even if this flight is a bit cheaper I will gladly pay more and fly Qantas or Air NZ in future. Would not recommend this airline at all.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Air Tahiti Nui customer review,8,2009-10-18,PPT-AKL. Attentive flight attendants courteous with genuine care. Hot brunch was not the best I've had on Air Tahiti Nui with meal overcooked/overheated.

The three languages (French/English/Tahitian) used for inflight communication are well enunciated but could be restricted to French and English only as too many announcements are quite distracting.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Air Tahiti Nui customer review,8,2009-09-07,AKL-PPT. A very enjoyable flight - check in quick and pleasant crew friendly and professional. Food good and nice wine choices. Old style seats really let them down but otherwise nothing to fault,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Air Tahiti Nui customer review,5,2009-07-12,I have flown Air Tahiti Nui several times. I always fly First Class. The level of service on the 2 flights I took on this trip has diminished. The amenity kits are not the same. On the flight LAX to PPT I was given an appetizer that was a joke. A small piece of shrimp with some sauce and 2 pieces of cheese. This is not First Class Service I was used to with Air Tahiti Nui previously. The boarding process is nerve racking. I resent having to go boxed in the buses that transport you to the aircraft. They box you in like sardines. I pay nearly $5000.00 for a one way flight to PPT and get the same boarding treatment was a coach paying passenger.,False,,,First Class,,,,,,,1,,,True
Air Tahiti Nui customer review,8,2009-06-21,AKL-PPT-AKL. Did MEL-AKL earlier in the day with Emirates on a seperate booking. Bags checked in through to PPT at MEL did make it with us so no complaints there. Looking at the plane's fuselage the cabin decor and the Tahitian music playing made you feel you are going on a vacation. Inflight crew attentive and friendly especially on the way back. Meals were good. Only sore point was the IFE. It was not AVOD and very limited choices. Had the IFE been better would have scored this flight at 9 or 10.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,True
Air Tahiti Nui customer review,2,2009-05-31,The overnight flight Papeete to LA was cancelled without notice. We were booked on the flight 12 hours later which meant we could not make any connecting flights that day to JFK as we arrived too late. We were given an hotel room for the night before the flight but had to fend for ourselves in LA for the enforced overnight stop. The reason for the cancellation was not made clear but I would suspect it was none other than not enough passengers as cancellations seems to happen frequently. The same flight the previous evening had also been cancelled. At no time did anyone offer an apology. I would not recommend this airline as they are unreliable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Air Tahiti Nui customer review,10,2009-02-23,LAX-PPT-AKL-LAX Economy return. The flight from LAX to PPT was cancelled. I was notified about two weeks before the flight was supposed to leave. I was a bit peeved as the flight from LAX was a connecting flight and the cancellation meant that I had to overnight in LA and take the next flight the following morning. I explained my situation to Air Tahiti Nui and they put me up in a hotel (Four Points by Sheraton)and gave me dinner and breakfast vouchers! The flights were all on time plane modern plenty of room for economy. I'm 5'11 and was comfortable for the entire trip. The inflight entertainment is not as modern as it could be its not on demand but the movie selection is good and there is a nice selection of recent releases. One note of caution try to avoid any stopovers in Tahiti that will be longer than two hours - the airport is old and boring and there is nothing to do while you wait not even a TV to watch. The food was superb for economy and inflight service by the attendants was friendly polite and professional. Topping all of this off is the fact they were $700-$1000USD cheaper than ANZ Qantas or United.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Air Tahiti Nui customer review,8,2009-02-03,"AKL-LAX-AKL (via PPT) First Class. The service onboard is outstanding and pretty difficult to fault. The crew could not have been more professional or pleasant. Food AKL-PPT and PPT-LAX would have been at home in 5 star restaurant (less good on the return but still acceptable). Seats although first generation lie flat were comfortable and all features worked. There is no screen between passengers but I did not feel an invasion of personal space. Boarding on all legs was efficient and every leg left early . The negatives? Ground crew at all three airports. At the initial check in Auckland I did not get the aisle seat I had requested and had been confirmed with the airline 7 months earlier - and had to kick up quite a fuss - miraculously one opened up. The same thing happened PPT-LAX. On arrival at LAX no bags. They were off-loaded at PPT and could not be traced. They did turn up on the next flight: that isn't good enough on economy but it is completely unacceptable in First. The response of the LAX agents could not havee dismissive. Arriving back in Auckland bags (which had first and priority labels) were the last to appear (perhaps I should be grateful that they appeared at all!). So inflight this is a rival to any airline and competitively priced on the Transpacific route; it certainly would have been a ""10"". If only they could get their act together with ground crew.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Air Tahiti Nui customer review,,2009-02-03,The flight attendants told passengers those in-transit to Auckland need not complete the Tahitian immigration forms and we should proceed to the transit lounge. This is what we had expected and made sense. Once off the aircraft though those of us who entered the lane marked transit lounge and walked the short distance to the transit lounge found it locked. No one could tell us why it was locked how to enter the lounge or what to do. We asked the cabin crew as they came off the aircraft and they shrugged their shoulders and walked on. Eventually we realized the only option was to complete Tahitian immigration forms and go into the baggage claim area as it appeared we might be able to enter the transit lounge from there. This however proved not to be true. Again no one seemed to know what we should do even though we kept asking how to enter the transit lounge. I speak passable French so this was not a language problem. Eventually we picked up our luggage and cleared Customs. When we entered the airport terminal I found an Air Tahiti Nui staff and she told us that the transit lounge was not open and we would have to go to a hotel for the night. She seemed unconcerned and disinterested. I then found the security office but they couldn't tell me anything. I returned to the Air Tahiti Nui staff who told me that everyone knows that Tahiti won't let passengers use the transit lounge and we should have known it. We weren't about to spend over $100 to stay in a hotel room for a few hours so along with two dozen other passengers we spent the time in the hot dirty smoky airport terminal. The ATN check-in desks finally opened at about 4-30 a.m. and we were able to get our boarding passes but as Security didn't open for another hour or so we were still forced to wait in the terminal. Once allowed into the departure lounge we found that it was shabby dirty and unpleasant. A small coffee bar sold food but didn't accept credit cards and we weren't about to go back out through Security to find an ATM to get cash in a currency we didn?t need just to buy a cup of coffee. You may wonder why we didn't just go directly to the departure lounge and wait there. Well the ATN staff in LAX refused to give us the boarding passes from Papeete to Auckland. They said that they issue boarding passes no more than three hours in advance. When we arrived in Papeete the check-in counters were closed. Thus we couldn't get boarding passes and couldn't get into the departure area. Three weeks later when departing Auckland I asked an ATN supervisor why they don't let transit passengers use the transit lounge. She said that in their view a layover of that length does not constitute in-transit and that they are unwilling to allow people to use the transit lounge. As ridiculous as this is the worst part is that they don't bother to warn you about it before you travel so you can take this into account when making your travel plans. Upon arrival back in Papeete with only an hour layover we again found the transit lounge locked even though flight attendants assured us we would be allowed to wait in the transit lounge. Instead they simply diverted transit passengers directly into the departure lounge even though most hadn't been issued a boarding pass in Auckland (we had one but only because I went back to the check-in counter and insisted upon it). Obviously they could have done exactly the same thing on the Papeete- Auckland overnight layover had they wanted to do so. I suspect the whole thing is a means of trying to force passengers to spend some money in Tahiti. Whatever the reason it is a shabby way to treat passengers.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
