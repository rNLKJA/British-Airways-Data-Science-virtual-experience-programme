"""The in flight experience was fine""",6,2022-08-09,"We were able to fit everything into carry on luggage, which was helpful, especially outbound. On the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control, check the bags, then get back into the passport line. This was frustrating, but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didn't actually have a problem. In addition, the employees marshaling the passport lines were very heads-up and were moving people to fill gaps in the line. They also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon, including those in English. We were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to JFK but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged. All of this means we were very fortunate, since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and  we didn't have to deal with AF ground service, which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than OK, either.  The in flight experience was fine, although AF is one airline where it pays to fly Premium Economy. We flew regular Economy because of the size of our group, and the service was less. Cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service. Much more attentive the further forward you go, which is not a very passenger-centric strategy. The aircraft wasn't new but had been refreshed. IFE worked and had lots of options. Outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time, return flight was on time. In Premium Economy or Business Class Air France an excellent airline, but in Economy it's a little disappointing.

My wife and I paid for direct roundtrip flights from Vancouver (YVR) to Paris (CDG) for our honeymoon trip, and that's where our first experience (and probably last) with Air France goes horrible. To start, our direct return flight home to Vancouver got cancelled, and they tried to put us on a connecting flight a day earlier, which obviously does not work with our travel plans as we are not even in Paris that 1 day earlier. Secondly, our seat selections for both our outbound and return flights that we made suddenly disappeared and my wife and I got separated to seats that were not together. We had booked our flights way earlier and there were lots of seat options at the time, but because they for whatever reason lost our seats, there were no good options left and my wife and I were stuck with choosing the only remaining option left for 2 seats together that were terrible, because all the seat selections had been taken now. I had to go through multiple several hour long phone calls with customer service to 1) get on a new connecting flight (no longer direct) for our return flight home, and 2) sort our all the seat selections for all of these flights, now that we were no longer on direct flights. What's weird is that our connecting flight home is now on Delta Airlines for both legs, not Air France? And they could not confirm me and my wife's seat selections to be next to each other for these flights, probably because they are on Delta Airlines rather than Air France? To make complaints, the customer service phone line does not handle this as they only handle reservations. We filled out the online complaint form on June 22 and have yet to hear back, as our flight is in less than a month now. We called their customer service line multiple times again to follow up on our complaint case #, but was told each time that they cannot do anything to help. When we asked to speak to a supervisor/manager, or be transferred to ANYONE who could possibly help, they said there is no human we can speak to directly, nobody they could transfer me to, no email or phone number to directly contact, and that I would have to wait for an email response to our complaint form, which again we had already waited for more than 1.5 months. In summary, this is our first time booking with Air France, and we have never experience such terrible non-existent customer service. This is not a single human you can speak to directly who can help with making things right. All you can do is submit an online complaint form into a black hole of cases that will never be addressed.

That struck me as odd, too, but that could be the case, I thought to myself and sat down again. More suitcases arrived, still being loaded into the same hold (so apparently the hold wasn't full after all). Meanwhile, my suitcase was still lying on the back of the car. At some point no more suitcases came and the loading belt was retracted. So I went to the stewardess again and told her that my suitcase is still on the back of this car and that the luggage strap is now being removed. After a short discussion, she fetched the pilot, who left the plane with my suitcase badge. I looked out the window and unfortunately the car on which my suitcase was lying was gone now too. After a minute or two the pilot came back and just said don't worry my suitcase will be on board. Then I just said if he was sure, because the last time I checked, my suitcase was still on the car and the luggage strap was retracted.

"""caused us so much unnecessary stress""",1,2022-06-26,"My husband and I experienced the worst bag checking experience of our lives on Sunday June 23rd with Air France in Paris traveling to Nice!  First, we were overcharged for our bags going from Paris to Nice. When we arrived the kiosks charged us $70, but it was only supposed to be $45. I tried to ask multiple Air France representatives for help and everyone ignored us and kept walking by. Since no one would help, we paid the $70 to get out of there. But one of our bag tags was missing. We paid for 3 $70 tags but we only received 2 printed. So we had to go get in line for a representative to help us. The line was long and moving slow. Once we got to the front, the Ai France representative confirmed that we were not supposed to be charged $70/bag we were only supposed to pay $45/bag. But he said he couldn’t issue a refund and we would have to file a claim which we are doing now. But he was trying to make us pay $45 again for the missing bag tag. He printed the tag for us and we put it on our bag, but after he realized I wasn’t going to pay the $45, since I already paid $70 for it, he ripped the tag off my bag.  I requested a manager and the manager told him he was wrong, and reprinted us a tag and told us to get in line to drop off our bags. This drop off line was so long and there was only 1 person at the front desk with 10+ stations. Finally when we got to the front, the third bag tag wouldn’t scan, so again we needed assistance which took pulling teeth to get. We waited and no one would help. Finally a manager saw us and took us to the side station, reprinted yet another tag and checked the bag for us and sent us to security to go to our gate. This entire situation took almost 2 hours which made us nearly miss our flight. When we landed in Monaco, 1 of our 3 bags did not show up.  We had to file a claim at the airport which the line was long and it took over an hour. We were in Monaco for 3 nights and the bag never came.

When our bags came out of the hold, my laptop display was broken. I work remotely and so had to replace this instantly, and getting in contact with Air France has been an absolute nightmare. Firstly, I called their customer service lines several times.

After we made it very clear that we were unhappy, we were given an armful of bread rolls and cheese to resolve the issue, as we'll as an extra desert and one pasta dish. This may have been the best they could do at the time, but was not exactly sufficient for a 13 hour flight.

"""lack of respect""",1,2022-04-03,"Madrid to Cork via Paris. I took the ticket with KLM and a few days after travelling, one of the stops I had planned was cancelled. They change my ticket with a stopover in Paris and the first thing: I'm still waiting for the difference between the ticket that I paid more for. They don't add the previous travel insurance to the new ticket. Air France sends an email that the flight is delayed a few days before and then at 1 am when the flight leaves at 6:10 am they send an SMS that is delayed another 40 minutes. Once on the plane, it was delayed another 40 minutes. No one explains why. Inside the plane, already arriving in Paris, it is going to land and a few seconds before this, it takes off again. Why? Nobody tells us anything. It gives me an anxiety attack not knowing what's going on, all the delays we had with this airline and the. Concern that I won't get to catch the other link and I get up to ask. I am dragged by the steward by the arm through the plane to my seat. Disrespecting me and making me and those around me even more nervous because we really believed that something very, very serious was happening since the stewardess' reaction was very abrupt. After arriving in Paris I had to run to catch the next flight to Cork. I arrive in Cork and they have lost my suitcase. I file the claim, they tell me that today I will have my suitcase, that they have sent it to cork because it must have stayed in Paris and still no one has called me, nor have I received my suitcase or anything.

"""great alternative to fly across the Atlantic""",8,2022-01-19,"First medium-haul experience with Air France. This is part of a connecting flight from LHR-MIA via CDG. Check-in at LHR was swift, thanks to Sky Priority (customers flying Premium Economy get Sky Priority access). Due to COVID, check-in meant extra checks and formalities during check-in. All my documents were verified in less than 20 minutes. I received my onward boarding pass to MIA. This is my first medium-haul trip with Air France. The equipment used on this flight was a 10 year old Boeing 777-300ER. I was among the first passengers to board this full and busy flight. The cabin crew upon boarding were very friendly and warm. The plane was in an immaculate condition and was kept very clean. We left 45 minutes behind schedule due to technicalities and the crew gave regular updates. After take off, the crew sprung into action. They distributed a sanitary kit which consisted of a mask, alcohol surface wipes and hand sanitiser. We were told that unfortunately, amenity kits were not loaded on this flight and the crew were very apologetic. The meal service was swift but was done with care. Lunch served was good in quality but lacking in quantity which is the only downside. The crew were also very proactive with the drinks service. After the main meal service, cabin lights were switched off and were invited to help ourselves to the self-help snack bar which was adequately stocked with drinks and snacks. The second meal service came in a rather chic paper bag which consisted of a warm sandwich, a bread roll, a muffin, a chocolate bar, orange juice and a yoghurt drink. In addition, drinks were served again. For a 9 hour flight, the quality of the meals served was good but lacking in quantity. Air France could perhaps increase their portions when it comes to Premium Economy dining. The seat on this aircraft is Air France's fixed shell seat which mean that rather than reclining, the seat slides forwards so that it does not intrude your personal space. The seat was wide with good cushion padding. The pillow and blanket also appeared to be off higher quality compared to other airlines I've flown with in Premium Economy. The seat also came with a leg rest which was a very good addition. Now, there are a lot of negative reviews of this product but I would say that this seat is adequately comfortable for a TransAtlantic flight. My back did get a little sore from the seat sliding forward but I used the pillow to add some padding. I requested for an extra pillow and was given one without hesitancy. As we were flying during COVID, cabin crew and passenger interaction was very minimal to keep each other safe. However, I noted that the crew were very responsive in meeting the needs of the passengers from what I observed. IFE content was outstanding. There were more than enough new Holywood films available and a couple of French, Western, Asian and Bollywood films. In addition, the IFE offering also had plenty of radio stations and Album selections. In addition, the plan is equipped with an external camera. Air France is nowhere near a perfect carrier as there are things that Air France could do better in terms of its Premium Economy service which in my opinion would be: increasing portion sizes of meals and offering a bar service as only red wine was offered during the drinks service.

The paperwork for Covid related info at CDG was never addressed over the PA, but there was a table (without pens) and some papers that should be filled out, but no-one working the gate said anything until you were scanning your BP with the gate agent, so many people would then retreat back to the table and back through the line of passengers waiting to board.

OK maybe this isn't on Air France, but from what she screamed to the security agents would suggest she had been given the wrong info by Air France the previous day when she was denied boarding because she didn't have the correct test to travel to USA.

I had 3 seats to myself so I was very comfortable but had I been in a full plane this would have been a long 11 hours indeed. The seat is pretty hard, the legroom is not bad for the class, one of the benefits of hard seats is their shape seems to generate a bit more space for the person behind. Entertainment system is good but not brilliant like Emirates system. I think you need to download an app before flying to access their wifi. The food was really disappointing. Pasta in a tomato sauce with a grain salad. I know Air France has meals available for purchase prior to flying, it would seem they are trying to push people in that direction as the free option was pretty poor. Staff we generally good, one steward hassled me for not wearing a mask at a time I was drinking water, really annoying but generally the staff were nice. Flying conditions were grim but the A350 skipped above the trouble at 40000 feet, it was bouncy but less modern aircraft would have been all over the place. I am being persuaded by the new kids on the block! All in all decent flight, price was good but Air France can do much better on the food.",True,A350,Business,Economy Class,Paris CDG to Sao Paulo,October 2020,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",4,4,,,True

The next day, when my travel was supposed to take place, I checked the link once more, but this time nothing showed up. I just got a blank internet site. By contacting the airline, they informed me that my booking was cancelled by them. I had received no information about this from the airline. The given reason was that it was apparently not possible to order a trip from Egypt with Air France online within the last 72 hours before departure. Nothing on their website had indicated this as far as I could see and my booking had through. The man I spoke to had no solution to this problem, but told me I had to personally show up at the airport and order a flight from Air France and pay in cash.

By calling them I got information that my second booking also had been cancelled (again with no warning from the airline) and that they wouldn't have personel on the airport until three hours before the flight, meaning not before 22:50 hours p.m. The guy I spoke to this time said he would make a new booking for me, but he could not guarantee that this new booking would also not be cancelled and he could give no guarantee for availability.

A queue of 4 parties spent almost an hour moving down the line, I was only moved to the front during last call for check-in...I arrived 2 hours before scheduled departure. Connection in Paris CDG was horrendous, the moment we landed, we had to rush out of the plane, rush to a shuttle to take us to the transit area. It was the longest queue I have seen at an airport passport control. We snuck into a priority queue and went to the front. Alas, after clearance, we had to wait for a shuttle to get to another terminal. At this point, we were almost sure we would miss the flight.

This was one of the many Air France-operated flights that are booked and managed through Delta, and this made the few gate changes and delays we experienced on both legs of the trip more complicated. However, the in-flight experience was pleasant and the aircraft was nice. I prefer Airbuses whenever I can fly them, and Air France does a good job of keeping seat pitch in theirs roomy for economy passengers. At the advice of some other reviewers, we paid the small and reasonable fee each way to ""upgrade"" to the upper deck of the cabin, which is a much more intimate space with a better attendant-to-passenger ratio. The pitch was also about 3' more generous, and the upstairs was a more quiet, warm space than any I've flown internationally. Meals came noticeably quicker in the upper deck, even considering that we were some of the last people upstairs to be served, and I did not run into a waiting line for the restroom once on either leg of the trip. I did not book in time to get an upper deck window seat, but I'd heard about the added bonus of a storage container that these passengers got included in the same ticket price I paid. I was in the middle but had a woman to my left without someone next to her, and I saw her window seat storage bin first-hand. It was big and literally fit all of her odds-and-ends. It was awesome and another reason to book this seat if you can. Well worth the money. Crew was friendly, food was okay but warm and well-portioned, and the in-flight entertainment was good. The only real negatives were the complications of booking Air France through Delta, which I feel created more delays and gate changes than would have occurred if I'd booked direct.

"""meal service most haphazard""",2,2019-05-19,"Flew the Boeing 777-300ER from San Francisco to Paris on our trip there and the plane was quite nice, crew performed their duties well and aside from the realities of Economy Class I had no major complaints. Our flight back on the A380 was significantly less enjoyable. Boarding was reasonably efficient, but I was again the victim of additional security checks at the gate (Happened my last trip in Taiwan as well) which meant I didn't get to board with my friend, and was among the last people on the aircraft. Luckily I didn't have any issues finding overhead space once finally onboard. Once on the plane I was shocked at how dated and worn everything appeared. Seat covers were ill fitting and faded, cabin lighting was dull, the IFE system was among the oldest and in quite poor condition, the remote was filthy, and the bathroom was something Air France should be ashamed of. I can only imagine that since they're already looking to retire half their fleet of 10 A380's they're avoiding putting absolutely any money into them. I've included photos of the more glaring discrepancies. The first meal service occured in the strangest and most haphazard manner I've ever experienced. Seated in row 46 there were about 5 rows behind and two rows ahead in our section. They began serving the rows at the back first, but then stopped, skipped the front three including my own row, then moved on to the next section of seating. After starting at the front t of that section they worked their way backwards until our row was the very last served. This meant room temperature food, and a wait of over an hour all while enjoying the aroma of food in the cabin directly behind us. In addition, the cabin crew disappeared completely for about 6 hours in the middle of the flight. At some point some snacks were placed in the galley area but we were never notified or served. I just happened to see someone seated ahead of me return with ice cream and was lucky to be in an aisle seat where I could grab one myself. The sole redeeming quality was the low cost of the flight, $360 RT, but the poor quality of the A380 cabin and crew means I would never recommend it.

The staff there had limited English, couldn't understand my friend much and it was also very difficult for my friend to understand them. He called more than 10 times, and only figured out the names cannot be changed but we are still not sure the reason. Air France and China Eastern tried to blame each other rather than helping us out. The day for our departure, we went to the airport to talk with the China Eastern. The staff there said names back front happens every day, the airlines can change them for us but it has to be Air France. We called Air France on site a few times with China Eastern staff together, we got the same answer, the names cant be changed because our flights were operated by China Eastern!

They have people waiting with absolutely no distinction between checking in for foreigners vs EU residents and yet we get to the front after 30+ minutes in line and tell us we need to be in another line.

Last big complaint I have, from every three announcements one was repeated in English and on the plane the English was really bad (English is not my first language either but people can understand me clearly at my job)! At Paris airport I noted to one of the ladies that they announced check-in but didn't do it in English and I wondered if that's standard procedure. She said ""I will check sir!"" Went to the lady who was doing announcements and after giggling loud while I was 5 meters away, started announcing in French and English. Finally on the short trip to London, same thing, some announcements in English many without. I fly to Germany via Lufthansa a lot, they love their language as much as the French still they always announce first in German and then in English like clock work. It's something that shows respect to their passengers and a simple understanding that not everyone knows German. I could had added other issues such as the cleanliness, the old broken arm rests and the inhuman seats. The problem from my point of view was a clear lack of care for the passengers and a lack of professionalism by the staff. To sum it up, never again!

As usual, I left plenty of time, 3.5 hours to be exact from the arrival of the Air France operated flight to my connection with AA in NY. As I have global entry I’ve found that leaves plenty of time. All seemed fine until the flight was delayed once, then twice, then three times, then four times. Never with a notification other than when people lined up for the boarding time only to see the screen at the gate had changed departure time once again. They gave 11 Euro vouchers for lunch, which mind you in CDG is not at all equivalent to a meal with even a water. I found that only one passenger had received a notification email that the flight was delayed (the first time) way earlier. 6:30 AM Europe time zone. No one else received this notification. Of course, Air France knew and left us all waiting like animals for the many delays at the gate throughout the entire day for a fight that was supposed to depart by 1:30PM I inquired what the issue was, the desk said “weather in JFK” so I called JFK hoping to find that my connecting flight would too be delayed. Not the case. The true reason was a mechanical issue with a plane they had en entire morning and afternoon to fix or change aircraft, but didn’t. We left at 6PM and 400 people found themselves waiting anther bout post landing sitting in the plane seat, not at a gate because we were royally late and there was no gate for us. I then find out from a family member calling Air France on my behalf that if t is a mechanical issue, the company would I cut expenses of inconvenience. For us, missing our fight home and having to pay to stay the night in New York plus the change fee for airline tickets home the next day was not at all ideal. Moreover, no one at Air France wanted to take responsibility they than telling me to send an email to customer service.

"""difference to low cost airlines minimal""",3,2017-12-17,"Tel Aviv to Stockholm via Paris CDG. I arrived at the airport well in advance, and since I only had cabin baggage I could proceed directly to security, which is a big advantage at Ben Gurion where there is often a long line at check in. I had tried to order a gluten free meal for the flight, but I realized I could not do that since the meal at the first flight was considered breakfast, where there is no option of gluten free, and on the second flight they only serve what they call a ""snack""; so there is no option there either. So there goes one of the reasons not to choose a low cost carrier instead. Buying a cheap ticket at Air France you don't get any check in luggage anyway, so the difference compared to low cost airlines is minimal. Well, you get some kind of meal, if you manage to eat it, and some coffee for free. But the worst part is the seating comfort. I have recently flown with low cost carriers like Ryanair and Norwegian, and both of these have had more leg room than Air France. I am not very tall, so if you are a bit taller than 1.90 m you will probably have to pay extra to get a better seat at this airline. They also make people pay in order not to have to choose between the last available seats 30 hours before departure. The airplane was decent enough, but since most passengers don't want to pay extra for baggage there was lots and lots of cabin luggage, and the staff were a bit too aggressive when trying to stow it away. Also one of the toilets on one of the flights did not have tap water. It would have been better if that was marked on the door. So I am sorry to say that Air France tends to get worse and worse for every time. The only reason to choose Air France is if you can manage to get enough time in Paris to go into town.

The flight from VIE arrived in CDG 15 mins delayed due to an ATC slot, which should not have been an issue, but it was. We had a scheduled transfer time of 1 hour, which was now reduced to 45 minutes. CDG is a disaster and even the scheduled transfer time of one hour would have been not enough to be at the gate before the official flight closing time. Long lines at passport control with no special lines for EU-passports and no short connection lines. Also, nobody there from the airline or the airport to assist with short connections. Then a bus transfer between the terminals that seemed to circle the whole airport with multiple stops and which took almost 30 minutes. CDG has to be the worst organized airport in Europe. When we arrived at the gate (the very last at the end of the terminal) just before the indicated departure time, the gate was still green as open.

We were then issued a meal voucher, but we had to wait for hour at the counter till AF got the approval from OS Otherwise AF would not issue it. Because, we were again told it is not AF policy to take responsibility whatsoever for a codeshare flight. Ridiculous and insulting!

Arrived in Paris at time. Unfortunately the time at the border control took very long (approx. 1 hour) so I've made it just in time to the connection flight. Second part CDG-LIM won Air France 777-300. Old plane, and so was the IFE. Seats were cramped and legroom was so so. Seat had an USB port. It was a daytime flight of 12,5 hours. After departure (which was on time) the served already the lunch. You couldn't make a choice, and there was no drink service before or a towel. After the lunch was been served we didn't see the crew anymore. If you needed a drink, you had to go the galley by yourself. There were limited snack (little ice creams and small sandwiches). An hour before arrival we got a snack (orange juice, small piece of bread and a cake). It was not much. The food tasted good. Overall I thought that the service was limited (especially if you compare it with other airlines or with partner KLM). You pay a lot of money, and therefore you don't get much service. The same features with the IFE, which had limited options and didn't work properly. So I'm not impressed with the services provided by Air France. Third part was back from LIM-CDG with AF 777-300. This plane was slightly newer, and the legroom felt better, and so were the seats. IFE was still old. This was a night flight. Service started just after departure (same as on the way to LIM only one meal option). The service on this flight was limited too. On a night flight I don't care about that, but in the night your neighbour sometimes want to pass because they wanted some water (they dont walk by once a hour). So that annoyed me. I've slept the most of the flight, despite that my neighbour wanted to pass two times. Second (breakfast) meal was not much, so also here was the service under par. Last part of the journey was CDG-AMS with AF A320. Legroom was ok, seats were good. Service was fine for this short haul flight (sandwich and drinks). I wouldn't recommend flying with AF based on my experiences. You pay a lot money for the ticket, service was limited and the quantity of the food was below par. Furthermore the IFE was old and didn't work properly. The seats are cramped and the legroom was so so. I like to fly with KLM (friendly crew and enough service), but AF is not comparable.

It's usually not in my preferred list because of reputation and pricing. It has changed since this journey! First of all, we left Brussels by train to reach Paris CDG, that was a first for me and I got two nice surprises. First of all, you check your luggage directly at the train station and it follows you until the final destination (which it did), secondly, despite our Premium Economy ticket and the fact that the train ticket were supposed to be Economy class, we got first class seats in the TGV. That was a nice start. No trouble from the station to the airport, boarding was just fine, crew members very nice and friendly, I was pretty impressed as my expectations were way lower than that. The cabin was neat, plane was clean, and  the food was probably one of the best food I ate on a plane, despite being only Premium Economy, it was better than my last Business class trip.  Then comes the time to check the entertainment system, once again, I was surprised. The usual list of movies, few games and info, pretty classic but efficient, and, the nice touch is the music selection. I found a real selection of my favourite genre, and, I mean real like latest albums, various renown artists but not mainstream. Well, I sticked to the movies anyway, but that was a nice touch, I appreciated it. The way there and return were both equally nice, Boeing 777 and Airbus A380, everything was really nice and for once, I'd recommend Air France despite my initials feelings.",False,A380,Business,Premium Economy,Brussels to Johannesburg via Paris,September 2017,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",5,5,,4,True

"""old Business Class is a joke""",3,2017-08-30,"✅ Verified Review |  Paris to Santiago de Chile. Air France old Business Class is a joke. A 7-across cabin (2-3-2) is the worst : this means you either climb over another passenger to access the aisle or someone else does it to you. The seat is ridiculously narrow and does not recline to a fully-horizontal position, which means that during the flight you slowly slide towards the lower side of the seat, being unable to sleep properly (especially in a 15 hours flight like CGD-SCL). The pitch is reduced as AF uses all the space available and - when flat - a good portion of your legs goes below the seat in front of you, reducing your chances to move. Food nothing special - which is a shame given France's tradition of good food, wine good and champagne really good. IFE not bad but with a reduced selection of international movies and a gigantic amount of French movies; amenities kit normal (although the look and feel of it is a bit cheap). And then we have to talk about the crew: after the first interactions with FAs it was clear that I did not speak French, well all FAs kept referring to me in French and changed to English only when I - again and again - advised them that I did not. This is something that has always happened in AF and I really fail to understand why, looks rude and actually is a rude attitude. I have been told the new business class is a long way ahead of the old, my advice is to avoid at all costs the old one (easily detectable in the aircraft map with a 2-3-2 configuration).",False,Boeing 777-300,Business,Business Class,Paris to Santiago de Chile,July 2017,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",3,2,,,False

Everything (absolutely everything) went above my expectations for my flight from Hong Kong to Kiev via Paris CDG. I'm a very frequent traveler, so I know what to expect, but again, they pleasantly surprised me at every stage of travel. I don't review the booking process as I booked at klm.com where everything worked fine. The small issue was when buying online a la carte meal option (didn't work in Safari browser) I had to make in Chrome. Then I had trouble with paid seat option: seat of my choice disappeared from my booking. Contacted them via Facebook and got it done in 30 minutes. Perfect! In town check in in Hong Kong worked fine. At the airport boarding was done in perfect order. On the plane, I found seating quite satisfactory despite it being 10 in row (I booked Duo set at the back). Padding was comfortable, and recline was enough to seat in relaxed position (I'm 186 cm tall). Entertainment options were amazing with lots of documentary and arthouse. Dining was fine. My a la carte order was delivered without noticing. All the crew were nice and very effective despite full flight and lots of Chinese customers who required lot of translation services. Toilets kept clean and stocked. Cabin had fresh look and didn't feel claustrophobic even with such a tight layout. Breakfast served was good. Departure and arrival on time. My bag made the connection. No problem with transfer within CDG 2E from gates L to gates K by train via fast security search. My next flight to Kiev was bang on time. European flight seating comfort is only good when you purchase exit row seat. Otherwise it is not good even in business cabin. Food was good again with full bar service.

"""glad that AF proved me wrong""",9,2017-02-13,"Flew Air France from Birmingham - Paris CDG - Singapore and back during the year-end holidays. Until now I had not flown long-haul on European airlines, as I had an unfavourable impression of them compared to Asian/Mid Eastern ones. I reluctantly chose AF as it was really cheap (less than SGD 1,000 return) even during high season, and also because I could avoid Heathrow. It was also less disruptive to my sleep because the transit point was just an hour away, rather than mid-journey as is the case for Emirates/Qatar. But, reading mixed reviews about AF, I did not expect much especially for the price I was paying. I am glad that AF proved me wrong. The planes are well-maintained, the in-flight service is actually pretty good and the amenities are great. The CDG-SIN long-haul flight and its return leg had decent seats, newly-installed IFE with a wide range of movie options, and more than sufficient food - I really appreciated the mini snack-bars in the galleys. Only pity was that the meals on the return leg were not as tasty - maybe because they were prepared by SATS in SIN. The short-haul flights between BHX and CDG were basic but got its job done. The transit in CDG was smooth and the airport was pretty decent, it even had a newish-looking free transit lounge that provided power points and plush chairs. A small hiccup though was the poor attitude shown by the baggage agent at Birmingham airport. She was quite combative. Thankfully another agent eventually resolved my issue satisfactorily. Perhaps I'm not a very picky person but I felt that AF was at least on-par or even better than the Asian airlines, this is especially in contrast to SQ, which in early 2016 were still using the same IFE system on their 777s after more than a decade.

"""a truly regrettable service""",2,2017-01-11,"✅ Verified Review |  Air France was a terrible experience. We have a Madrid to Washington DC flight with stopover at Paris CDG, the worst organized in Europe. When we are checking in we are told that one of the hand luggage, typical Samsonite that meets all the measurements to take it on the plane, we cannot take it with us and we have to check it. So we ended up charging the 2 big suitcases and a small one. We landed in Paris about 12:20. At that same moment the passengers of the flight that has to take us to Washington DC begin to embark, since the flight leaves at 13:15. To catch the flight we have to: Exit the plane, pass the passport control where we find a queue of about 200 people that we have to jump, change terminal with a bus and then arrive at the boarding gate. We ended up catching the flight only because it was delayed for almost an hour, that saves us. We arrived in Washington DC and the PA calls me and my wife. We are informed that our suitcases have stayed in Paris and that they will come the next day at 20:00. What seems to me most outrageous about this issue is that they offer you a flight with a connection where you have about 50 minutes to do all the running around possible to catch it and they take for granted that they do not have time to change the plane bags. The next day we stayed home to pick up the bags at the indicated time, 20:00 -  the bags do not arrive and we decided to call Air France. An agent tells us that only 2 suitcases come and that the other is still in Paris, and tells us that the suitcases arrived at 6 in the morning instead of the promised time. We go to bed and at 2 in the morning they call us, we do not know the number and it turns out that there is a van out of the house with a suspicious look, we imagine they are the suitcases. I change in a hurry to go and meet them and at that moment the van starts, my wife yells at the window and we get the guy to stop.  We have not yet received any apology from Air France, which has offered us a truly regrettable service. Take great care with Air France!  Air France, terrible experiencia!! Llegamos al aeropuerto mi mujer y yo. Tenemos un vuelo Madrid – Washington DC con escala en el aeropuerto de Charles de Gaulle de París, el peor organizado de Europa. Cuando estamos facturando nos dicen que una de las maletas de mano, típica Samsonite que cumple con todas las medidas para llevarla en el avión, no la podemos llevar con nosotros y la tenemos que facturar. Por tanto acabamos facturando las 2 maletas grandes y una pequeña. Aterrizamos en París sobre las 12:20. En ese mismo instante los pasajeros del vuelo que nos tiene que llevar a Washington DC empiezan a embarcar, ya que el vuelo sale a la 13:15. Para coger el vuelo tenemos que: Salir del avión, pasar el control de pasaportes donde nos encontramos con una cola de unas 200 personas que nos tenemos que saltar, cambiar de terminal con un autobús y luego llegar a la puerta de embarque. Acabamos cogiendo el vuelo de milagro y porque éste se retrasará casi una hora, eso nos salva. Llegamos a Washington DC y por la megafonía nos llaman a mi mujer y a mí. Nos comunican que nuestras maletas se han quedado en París y que vienen al día siguiente a las 20:00. Lo que me parece más indignante de este asunto es que ellos te ofrecen un vuelo con una conexión donde realmente tienes unos 50 minutos para hacer todas las virguerías posibles para cogerlo y ellos dan por hecho que no tienen tiempo de cambiar las maletas de avión, que es una gestión mucho mas rapida y directa que la que tiene que hacer un pasajero. Al día siguiente nos quedamos en casa para recoger las maletas a la hora indicada, las 20:00. Pasa una hora, dos, las maletas no llegan y decidimos llamar a AirFrance. Un agente nos indica que de las 3 maletas sólo vienen 2 y que la otra sigue en París, además nos dice que las maletas llegaran a las 6 de la mañana en lugar de la hora prometida. Por si fuera poco la información que nos da sobre las maletas no se corresponde con la que ofrecen en la web. Nos vamos a acostar y a las 2 de la mañana nos llaman, no conocemos el número y resulta que hay una furgoneta fuera de casa con una pinta sospechosa, nos imaginamos que son las maletas. Me cambio a toda prisa para bajar y en ese momento la furgoneta arranca, mi mujer le grita desde la ventana y conseguimos que el tipo se detenga no se pire con las maletas.

Soon after takeoff the aperitif service started with a glass of Champagne or juice and some very tasty crackers. My husband pre-ordered me a meal (with additional fee) which was good, but from my point of view it’s not worth for this price. The regular meal looks not like Premium Economy and is only offering a starter in addition to standard meal. Air France is offering an open bar in the galley with soft drinks, beer and sandwiches during the flight. Prior to landing our friendly flight attendant served a kind of warm pizza snack with another bar service.

"""enjoyed my first experience with Air France""",8,2017-01-01,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Warsaw via Paris VDG. Booked outbound flights with Air France via their partner KLM's website. This meant we couldn't choose our seats at the time of boarding. However, online check-in opened 30 hours before departure and we could change our allocated seats at that point. We were happy with the allocated seats on this occasion. Air France website was easy to use, and the check in process was very simple and quick. Printed our boarding passes to minimise queuing at Heathrow (outbound travel was with hand luggage only despite paying the extra for checked baggage). Stepping onboard our flight to CDG we were met by two smiling cabin crew and directed to follow the queue down the single aisle. The onboard team were friendly and courteous. During the 1 hr flight, a full bar service was offered, plus we were given a small chocolate muffin. Given the short flight time, the captain announced we were beginning our descent before half the passengers had been served. It can sometimes appear that in order to offer a ""full service"" to passengers on short haul flights, things seem so rushed. In no time at all, we were back on the ground and taxiing to the gate at CDG. Flight no 2, to Warsaw was slightly different. As we boarded, there was only one flight attendant, and she was talking on the phone so the passengers just walked passed without the usual greeting. This was the first time I have experienced this - there are usually two attendants at the door so even if one has to take a call, the other performs the customary welcome. I noticed that with both flights, the pre-departure safety announcement did not feature instructions on use of the life jackets.  This flight was longer, so the bar service and sandwich (choice of salmon or cheese) was more relaxed and enjoyable - so much so, I requested a second bottle of wine. There were only two lavatories onboard meaning a queue formed at times. If there was anything to improve these two flights it would be a few small screens to show the flight route. It gives passengers some kind of reference while we're cruising above the clouds. All things considered, I enjoyed my first experience of travelling with Air France. I have read various reviews, but the product they offered ( two short haul flights at a reasonable price) was pretty good in this instance, our flights got us to Warsaw slightly ahead of time which was our key concern. My main reason for choosing particular airlines is a combination of cost, service and flight times. For us, flight times are the main factor - we can usually trade off a higher cost against better flight times, and for short flights, the service doesn't to be anything special.

Breakfast was abysmal - basically nothing but sugar and nothing even vaguely nutritious. But the biggest downfall of Premium Economy are the shell seats.

The service was excellent and the food was the best we have had on any long-haul flight over the last few years. We had all our pre-agreed seat allocations but on three of the four flights we did overhear that others had been moved, with some families being separated.

Not only did they not work, both were stuck ""on"" so you had bright monitor lights shining in your faces while trying to sleep. It could not be shut off. Then seat 85K would not recline at all, it was broken.

I filed a complain when we got back home with Air France, only to find that Delta Airlines handles the complaints for Air France. They were sorry, and offered some free mileage for the inconvenience. Nothing more, nothing less. Well, this might be a good thing to a frequent flyer, but in our lifetime, we will never have enough mileage, with or without their offering, to earn anything. So the mileage offering was nothing to us. This was a once in a lifetime vacation so we paid the extra money for the upgraded seats, only to have these indicated issues. There is no skin off Delta's nose to handling the complaint. I got the usual ""this is the best we can do"" response. Despite my repeated emails to Delta about this poor offering, they will do no more. The flight back home, two weeks later was great.

Just about OK for economy class, unacceptable for a business class. But at least the champagne was warm. A lamb dish that couldn't have been more overcooked. The rest was completely uninspiring. A self service ""buffet"" that any self-respecting airline should have been embarrassed to offer, even in economy. Narrow seat, but just about OK for sitting up in, but uncomfortable as a bed , angled rather than lie-flat. Verdict: The worst business class flight I've ever had.

The past few years I've flown from Europe to Chile, Air France has offered the best value tickets, at about 500 GBP return these were significantly less than all other options, and when I first flew in 2009 the service was far from bad. However as of my last journey in 2015, the quality has gone down. 10 Abreast in a 777 has never been a good thing, and the seats are not particularly comfortable either. The cushions are hard, the headrest is quite awkward, and the majority of the seats have the entertainment boxes underneath them, leaving little room for people with longer legs. Even though I am not tall I notice it. The interiors of the 777s are quite old, the IFE screen is pretty awful and there are no services such as in seat AC or USB chargers. There is not too terrible a selection of entertainment, but I don't really find myself spending all too much time on it due to the screen being too bright in the night and being so small. The crew often seem to forget to check the tissues and paper towels in the lavatories.  Meal quality is mediocre, particularly bad is the bread which is dry and tough. They serve decent wine and during the night there are serve yourself carts to get ice cream, drinks, and sandwiches. The cabin crew are generally quite friendly, and although they are not out looking to make you feel comfortable, when you ask they will serve you attentively. Unfortunately 2016 has brought higher prices, generally around the same range as the other carriers that offer this route.

What happened to a trolley coming down every hour or so to avoid this? The flight back was a different experience, the plane from BKK to Paris was clearly older with old IFE (and less than half the films of the outgoing flight) with no USB charger, the seats were uncomfortable and heavily compressed and the staff were quite simply rude, ignoring all requests for assistance from any passenger than attempted to get hold of someone. Basically astonishingly poor service. Also the food on the way back was sub par, seemingly because they don't control the food supply from Bangkok and rely on Thai Airways. (Given the Thai Airways stickers all over the packaging). We had a transfer at CDG to Heathrow, the plane was departing at approx 9pm but it not only left late, but Air France didn't prep the plane and therefore we had to spend 30 minutes in total to head to a de-icing zone. The staff however were at least pleasant on this flight. However the journey wasn't over, Air France then managed to lose one of our bags in the transfer from CDG to Heathrow.

The airline staff were very rude and did nothing to make us feel comfortable. After spending almost 16 hours in the airport, the staff told us that they can only make our sleeping arrangements in the Air France Lounge after 11:30pm.

I wanted to take a shower before leaving and the staff in the morning refused to give me the access to the bathroom since they did not have the staff to clean the bathrooms.

"""service onboard above average""",7,2016-01-12,"We chose premium economy because it was only Can$500 more than the already very low Air France economy fare. The fare allowed us a free stop-over in Paris, double the luggage allowance and about 4 times more miles compared to the lowest economy fare. Check in at Vancouver Airport was a breeze - there was no line-up at the Sky Priority counter and boarding the A330 was as quick as we used the Sky Priority line. The premium economy cabin was cozy due to its small size, and quite luxurious, reminiscent of business class in the 1980s. Seating was 2-3-2, spread across a few rows, with more than ample legroom and considerably wider seats than economy class. The bucket seats offered 40% more space than economy and they reclined within a fixed area to ensure that personal space could not be encroached upon from the front or back seats. The backseat TV screens were 12 inches and there were plenty of relatively recent movies to while away the time if you can’t sleep. Food was standard economy fare although Air France claims the starter is ‘inspired by the Business Class menu’. Wine was from good French stock and plentiful, if one so desired. One problem was that premium economy passengers did not quite know which toilets to use, as curtains were used to cordon off the business toilet on the left, but not the right, and vice versa. Another set of curtains cordoned off the access to the economy cabin. This happened intermittently on all four legs of this journey, including the A380 to Johannesburg and the flight back to Vancouver. After checking in at Paris CDG Terminal 2E, we were allowed as premier economy passengers, to purchase access to the business class lounge for Euro30. It was worthwhile as we had a six hour wait and it is one of the best business class lounges – outstanding showers, good food and a wide selection of wines and spirits. The flight on the A380 to Johannesburg was smooth and it remains my favourite aircraft due to its size, spaciousness and because it is so quiet. The premium economy cabin is located on the upstairs deck. The layout was 2-3-2 and we had the two seats on the side, with lots of storage and head space above the window. Food and service were good, in line with expectations. On our return from Cape Town, the first leg to Johannesburg was on South African Airways on an Air France ticket in economy class, but we managed to check our luggage all the way to Vancouver. As we had another 5 hours to wait in Johannesburg, we wanted to use the business lounge paying with miles, which was within the rules governing lounge access to premium economy passengers, but were not allowed, contrary to Air France’s website rules. The A380 flight back to Paris and the B777 to Vancouver were fine, but the movie selection did not change much between Sep to November on this routing. All in all, apart from the irritations concerning lounge access, Air France still delivered a prime product on this route and in this class.

Air France customer review,9,2015-09-09,"I flew Air France from Manchester to San Francisco via Paris CDG on a business trip to the US. Their first class fares were pretty reasonable - at just over £3500 for a return journey which while some will think is excessive - others will know that business class fares can easily exceed this for trips across the Atlantic. Air France use Flybe for some flights from MAN - this part of the flight experience was shocking - with a 2hr delay out of MAN, so bad that I had 20 minutes to make my connecting flight with AF. This is where things most definitely picked up - I was greeted at the door of the aircraft by my personal Air France assistant who drove me to the CDG-SFO aircraft. From leaving the MAN-CDG flight I was onboard the CDG-SFO flight in under 10 minutes. However if I'd not been in First with Air France, I'd probably have not made the connection so my experience here is for a La Premier experience. Air France A380's are very spacious with 9 first seats, which give the design there's an abundance of personal space. They seem to have 3 versions of their first product, with the A380 having the older 2 of these. They are both flat bed but offer less privacy than their new product which I believe is only on certain Boeing 777 routes. The newer of the A380 first suites is okay with a larger privacy screen - I got this on my CDG-SFO flight. However their older product, which I had on my return journey, has a very minimal privacy screen. This made me slightly uncomfortable as I didn't want my fellow PAX to see me mouth open snoring away during the night flight back. Seat comfort on both is very good. The seat has recline and leg support both electronically activated. Plenty of storage space with a large drawer under the ottoman. I had (according to my sleep tracker watch app) 6 hours of sleep with a 2 hours of deep sleep. Which is pretty good for an airline ""bed"". They do have a liner which gives some additional mattress style comfort and easily one of the best duvet/pillow combinations I've had in the air - apparently courtesy of Sofitel. The IFE is at best fairly basic with the generic slow to respond touch screen, but it's functional. Some of the functions didn't work (camera views) but overall it provided the service. Interestingly the screens in Business are significantly bigger on the A380 than in first. However where Air France are excelling is the service you receive as their La Premier customer. This really is simply the best end-to-end flight experience I've had from any airline (when flying AF not Flybe). I was contacted a few days prior to my flight to ask if I needed anything specific. My Air France assistant also personally ensured that both West and East bound my bags made the flights - coming back on board to confirm this to me despite the ridiculously short connection times. On my return flight the fist class cabin was completely full - yet the service remained consistent and personal throughout, I fly very regularly and this experience with Air France have just made them my preferred choice for my long-haul travel.",False,A380,Business,First Class,MAN to SFO via CDG,August 2015,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",5,4,,1,True

I booked the long flights on American first class for both of us. For the connection from CDG to LIS I had just booked standard economy seats. Seeing this was an anniversary trip, I decided to upgrade my economy tickets to BC. This was a little over $600 per ticket. As we boarded the plane, I knew instantly this was not going to be a good experience, as I turned to look at my business class seat that I spent over $600 upgrading to, I realized that the only difference between my seat and an ecomomy seat, is that they don't seat anyone in the center seat.

The FA came over twice to tell me to put my seat up and both times, once we got the seat into position, it reclined again on its own.

You cannot - you have to take a train, clear border control then security again. We were told this would all take place in Nice - wrong again.

The online check-in was very straightforward (I appreciated the e-mail confirming that check in had opened) and there were no issues there. The outward leg from BHX to CDG was fine, didn't expect to be served a snack but the croissant was practically inedible and thrown straight in the bin. The organisation at CDG was lacking. There was a delay of 45 minutes on the ground with no explanation from the staff, then the gate of departure was changed to a gate that was already boarding a separate flight to Dubai, with the new gate's screen not being updated to reflect this. This caused a large rush of people and a lot of anger and confusion, and although the staff did make an announcement confirming the Chicago-bound passengers were to board first, this didn't feel like enough as a lot of people remained confused and unsure of what was happening. We were then delayed for a further hour on the tarmac, although we were kept updated by the captain regarding this. Seats were okay, food was okay, a good selection of entertainment but the quality of the screens is poor and the sets only designed for the headsets handed out so sound quality was abysmal on normal headphones.

I didn't want to fly business class but simply suggested that a couple of other passengers could be upgraded freeing up two seats together for my wife and myself. I asked to speak to a manager - none were available. I was told that I was only an economy passenger and that to get anything better I would have to purchase two business class single fares amounting to almost 1000 Euros.

Air France customer review,2,2015-05-31,Air France AF681 on March 23 2015 from Atlanta to Paris was extremely harsh on me while I was traveling alone with my 13-month old son. They took away the stroller before I entered the flight and promised to give me a replacement at Paris. They gave no reason why my own stroller would not be given back to me and will directly be sent to New Delhi - my final destination. I had bought this stroller specifically as per Air France requirements/size limit. In Paris CDG airport they initially said they will give me a stroller at baggage claim (that makes no sense as I was not collecting my baggage). Then they said it will be given after I walk down to the next entry point. Finally they said they will give it at the boarding and I said that I will not need it at that moment. Carrying my son in one hand I had to manage my backpack and two more pieces of carry on baggage and had to take numerous stops before I reached the next flight. Not to mention I had to go through the security check too. Had my parents not met me in Paris CDG airport mid-way to join me on the next flight I would have missed the connecting flight that I had to catch within about an hour. Even in AF681 flight there were no attendants to help me to even mix the formula milk for my son and my co-passenger helped me. Website mentions about kid's meal that I had ordered beforehand only to find out that this will not suit my baby. I had to order baby meal (which is basically milk) but no one mentioned that when I pre-ordered meals over the phone before my travel.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,3,,,False

Staff service was marked by its absence. Drinks very limited. Video system old does not work well and not much choice. Climate control in cabin poor the flights became hot and stuffy. Cabin dirty.

Air France customer review,5,2015-05-20,KIX-CDG-OSL in March first leg with 777-200 second operated by HOP! with an Embraer 190. At Osaka Kansai Airport Air France operates at the southern part of the terminal which means a short train ride from the main hall. I arrived about one hour earlier than I really needed to so I had lot of time to spend in the deserted South terminal which really doesn't have many shops or dining areas. This hasn't anything to do with the airline though. But anyway - boarding went smoothly and fast maybe because most of the PAX were Japanese but more likely because very few PAX. The seats of Air France's old cabin at first look looks quite comfortable and nice but really they isn't. They're too hard and worn for a 12 hour flight. TV-screens were also quite worn and the IFE system even worse. Luckily Air France provides a generous amenity kit even in their economy class with noise- cancelling ear plugs low quality headphones sleeping mask and a wet-wipe which they are handing out shortly after takeoff. Food quality is average. We got a choice of two dinners a Japanese (a sesame beef I believe) or a Western as well as breakfast. Catering was extremely poor during the 12 hour long flight they only came serving us beverage two times. And by the way cabin crew wasn't really nice either. They seemed stressed and tired. The captain on the other hand made an announcement every time arriving over new areas which was nice. Second leg was an average short haul-flight with beverage and a sandwich.

Air France customer review,1,2015-05-12,Air France flight 333 April 19 from Boston to Paris CDG was cancelled due to mechanical difficulties at 8:.00 boarding for 8.45 flight. Over 400 passengers told to go retrieve luggage which had to come from cancelled flight and to get in line to rebook. Our group of 59 were given lodging at Chelsea Marriott and 3 meal vouchers. Fitted onto the same flight the next day. Actual flight delayed one hour to get a passenger on a stretcher on plane. One day of Paris hotel and tours missed. I will say that the Air France personnel kept us informed about the cancelled flight and offered glasses of water during the long wait. Returned flight 338 on April 27 from Paris to Boston also cancelled due to mechanical difficulties. Cancellation in Paris was very poorly handled. From moving our group to a more isolated area where many of us could sit on the floor to not providing an escort or transportation to the Ibis hotel which was close to a 2 mile walk because of poor directions and location of hotel to the limited staff at the hotel and restaurant which stopped serving early for both dinner and breakfast to being charged 385 euros for an oversized box which cost $100 on Aer Lingus to get it to Paris desk employees did not know English or refused to speak it etc. Food on flights was awful beverages were fine TV did not work for my son and on both trips we were sitting near screaming infants.

Air France customer review,1,2015-05-06,April 3 SIN-CGK Business Class - Air France has a very convenient eCheck-in option whereby you can elect to check-in automatically 30-hours prior to your flight (i.e. no need to manually do it online or via an app) and your boarding pass is sent to you automatically. I used this service for a SIN to CGK flight and arrived at the airport 90 minutes before departure. As I made my way through Immigration I was told to return to the AF check-in counter as the Immigration officials do not accept eBoarding passes for AF flights. Although this was slightly annoying I went to the AF counter. It looked like AF check-in counters were closing as majority of staff were packed up and only 1 counter was still open with a few pax in line. I asked a member of staff where the business class line was as it was not clear and was told that I can check-in using the kiosk. I did just that and received a boarding pass on thermal paper. I once again made my way to Immigration and this time was told that I could not go through Immigration unless AF has verified my documents. I tried to protest but ended up returning to the AF check-in counter again. All the counters were closed and all staff were gone. This was now 55 minutes before departure. In a panic I asked a member of Changi Airport Information Desk team if they could help me. They kindly tracked down the AF office number but there was no answer. A family had arrived by this time with 2 young children in the same situation as me: holding an eBoarding pass but not able to get through Immigration. One of the Changi Airport staff kindly went through Immigration to the Departure lounge and to the gate to approach the AF staff directly. She reported back over the phone that AF may not be able to let me board. 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure a member of the AF ground staff slowly made their way back to the check-in counter and handed me a 'proper' boarding pass and asked me to run to the gate or miss the flight. As she was checking that my passport was in order she told the family of 4 that they could also run to the gate and try and make the flight but there was no way their luggage would be flying with them that day. Looking back at no point during the check-in process (a) the reminder email to check-in online (b) the online check-in or (c) when using the kiosk to check-in - at no point was there ever a mention that the eBoarding pass or the boarding pass on thermal paper was not enough to check-in for the flight. The member of staff who directed me to the kiosk did not mention this either. I was very lucky that the Changi Airport staff kindly helped me but I feel sorry for the family with 2 young kids who I know was denied boarding even though they - like me - followed all the steps required by AF regarding online check-in. This experience alone has taught me NOT to fly AF from Singapore Airport under any circumstances.,False,,,Business Class,,,5,1,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,3,,,False
Air France customer review,9,2015-05-04,Paris CDG to Singapore return in first class. There was a change in aircraft on the outbound flight and I did not experience the new cabin but staff were excellent and I was alone in the first class cabin. The first class lounge in Paris was fabulous with an exclusive ambience. I was disappointed that I could not enjoy the complimentary massage as the therapist was ill but the rest of the service was excellent. Escorted through security and immigration control with no stress and driven to the aircraft in a limousine from the lounge. Return flight from Singapore was in the new first class cabin a really luxurious cabin with only four seats. Again was greeted as soon as I arrived at the Jet quay terminal in Changi airport and all details taken care off without any hassle. I was driven to the departure gate in a buggy a lovely gesture indeed. Overall Air France certainly knows how to define first class service. I have flown first class long haul with three other airlines before and not one could match the service of La Premiere with Air France. If I wanted to be critical there are some minor details. Firstly the cost is much higher than most other airlines. Secondly there is no complimentary limousine service to and from the airport.

As a frequent flyer from Saudi Arabia I find AF charter Saudi Air flights and pass them off as their own. For me this is unacceptable. If I wanted Saudi Air I would book Saudi Air. The toilets are always dirty and smelly the flight crew generally miserable and there are always extremely badly behaved kids crawling over the seats. What I've also found is the passengers here cannot wait for the plane to stop before they're out of their seats and there is no admonishment from the staff. The food is always bland and as cheap as possible they can't even be bothered buttering the sandwiches and the excuse for dinner is laughable. There is zero inflight entertainment.

That's just the start. The boarding is a shambles but that's more the fault of the airport than AF probably (a quick congratulations to Dakar airport authorities on the overall organisation. Great idea to have most of the customs counters unmanned at peak time loved the chance to ponder the beauty of the building during the 30 minute wait). Once in the plane you realise that AF apparently cannot manage to get someone to vacuum clean the cabin before passengers are corralled in. Dirty and it's like that regularly! Sheer neglect and laziness. Still the crumbs and detritus on the floor are in-keeping with the ageing and shabby cabin which for reasons I'm yet to understand is invariably full. Service is haphazard and characterised mainly by its slow pace. Can't a meal be served within the first hour of a 5-hour flight? Apparently not. I was asked 3 times by three different cabin staff to endure the 'breakfast' service an hour out of Paris a 'no' each time finally got the message across. One male steward was helpful the others behaved like it was all too much trouble. Main meal mediocre wine OK. Overall glad it's not me paying the tickets.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,2,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,2,,,False

Air France customer review,3,2015-03-04,Flew Zurich CDG Atlanta return in Premium Economy. Would normally fly Swiss or Lufthansa but needed a late flight back from Atlanta so chose Air France. Have to say the premium economy seats are roomy allowing me to work during the outward bound flight to USA but they are very hard and do not recline properly so was not able to sleep much during the return night flight. Food was disappointing I think Lufthansa offer the better choice of meals. Also the choice of drinks was poor and the attendants were not too helpful. On the return journey they didn't distribute the kit with toothpaste face mask etc. Choice of inflight films was quite good although the picture quality of the monitor was poor. Priority channel for boarding and check in is OK but CDG transfers and lounges are a nightmare bursting to the seams with passengers not enough seating and not enough toilets.,False,,,Premium Economy,,,1,2,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,3,,,False

Service diabolical seat uncomfortable food and beverage very average - all in all the most underwhelming of experiences just like BA in their nationalised period. The most extraordinary experience was to be told by 2 stewardesses over an hour between them to put out my reading light and go to sleep. 58 years ago aged 6 I might have accepted it but how utterly inappropriate behaviour. The first one actually reached past me and switched it off (this was maybe 30 minutes after they dimmed cabin lights after very poor food service). An hour or so later the second one tried and got a very brusque ""go away and leave me alone"" from me. This stunned her into saying ""you can't speak to me like that"" to which I responded ""I have now go away"". When did it become company policy for AF to treat customers like 6 year olds?

Air France customer review,2,2015-03-04,Flight to Cape Town from CDG. Booked premium economy for me and my wife 11.20pm. Take off on time - so far so good. The premium economy seat does not recline it just slides down a bit and a metal support strut for the seat in front is just where you want to put your foot. The seat is also hard and uncomfortable with what seems to be a metal bar running across the middle. Place the pillow under buttock to try to relive the pain. A full hour passed without any cabin staff making a appearance no aperitif no drink no nothing! Eventually some hour and ten minutes later a hostess brings a tray of food which has no resemblance to something you can actually eat one small bottle of vino and half a cup of coffee. That's it lights out and we never see anyone again until about 8.30am. No sleep at all the most uncomfortable flight ever. By 9am we are presented with more awful food and anther half cup of coffee. The return journey was no better and now we are awaiting our luggage as for some reason it did not fly with us.

This old 777-200 was to torn down with the space between the wall covers in the toilets filled up with filth. The seats were so hard that I decided to check what was going on and found out that the only separation between my“derriere and the seat metal structure was a 3 mm thin foam. Finally do not believe AF fancy adds about the food served in Premium Economy. We were served exactly the same meagre and unsavory portions as in Economy. When my wife got hungry about 6 hours after the meal she was informed that she had to wait for another two hours before to get anything. I can't say much about the crew because we seldom saw them.

Air France customer review,1,2015-01-19,YUL-CDG-BKK/CDG-YUL: I have never before encountered service as consistently poor and an inflight experience as negative as I did on my recent AF Flights. Nor did I think that a major airline in Europe could make US carriers look good in comparison. All of the AF equipment was distinguished by its tattiness uncomfortable seats dirt and an unpleasant cabin ambience. Positively the worst IFE I have experienced in the past 20+ years. The fact that Air France serves instant coffee sums up the quality of food service. I made the mistake of thinking that if cappuccino was on offer that it would be real. Instead I was treated to chunks of undissolved mix. Decent wine selection but that was it. One meal consisted of a sort of lamb dish. It was so overcooked it had gone to mush with what I presumed had once been vegetables. The dominant ingredient was salt. That was typical of the AF meal service. Checkin for flights at AF staffed desks was an unpleasant experience. The one dominant characteristic of most AF personnel encountered was rudeness and a disdain for the customer despite my speaking to personnel in French. On my last flight I was sent between 2 different terminals twice wasting 90 minutes on the shuttle bus doing the circuit of CDG. One clerk at the lounge in 2E-M sent me back to 2L while another sent me back to 2E-M with the monitors showing a different gate and then not showing anything. Finally once at the correct gate at 2E-M passengers were packed on to a crowded shuttle bus and brought back to 2L. Something isn't right at Air France. If one flies some of the better airlines like EVA Cathay or even Air Canada one quickly sees the differences. Air France does not give one the same confidence as they do and I felt that there was a lack of professionalism. I strongly recommend against using this airline until it sorts itself which I expect will take some time.,False,,,Business Class,,,2,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,,False

Unfortunately the IFE system was not working (purser informed passengers before boarding) but was therefor forced to sleep and arrived fresh. My only critic is the worn out impression of the cabin.

Air France customer review,5,2015-01-19,CDG-FLR on an A318. The flight was firstly late due to a technical issue with the plane. We waited on the tarmac with most of the doors open in the 3' C weather for about 45 mins. The food was atrocious. First of all is it too much of a luxury for AF to provide actual milk instead of powdered milk with their tea and coffee? The meal was a little sugary cheese something bun which was barely edible. The configuration of the plane was a little odd with small narrow and pretty uncomfortable seating with a very wide aisle. The staff were friendly enough but the IFE was non-existent. For a full service airline I thought that this flight was pretty poor.

Air France customer review,8,2015-01-14,Air France for the first time EDI-CDG-DXB return. Family of four. Despite having heard negative reviews in the past about flying via CDG and not speaking French it turned out to be relatively easy. The Cabin Crew on all sectors were very pleasant and attentive. Inflight catering was to a high standard. The only issue was on the return sector when one of our three bags did not arrive at our final destination. In fairness our connection was booked by myself and was just over one hour. I received a text immediately on arrival at EDI informing me of the missing bag and also various updates during the day with regard to it's delivery status.

Air France customer review,1,2014-12-29,Took flight 83 from San Francisco to Paris. One of the worst 11 hour flights ever. Got to my seat to find all of the electronics did not work. Notified staff before takeoff. There seemed to be some power to the electronics yet nothing worked. No light no music no monitor not even the attendant call button. I was told they could somehow reboot the system associated with my seat shortly after takeoff. After a couple attempts to reboot and two hours trying to get the crew's focus on the matter I was finally told that they would not be able to get the electronics of my seat working. They offered me magazines which is completely useless considering they dim the cabin lights and I had no light of my own which worked. So I got to sit in the dark and 11 hours of flight going out of my mind with boredom. What makes it worse is knowing that this airline would not have known that my electrionoc were not functioning properly before the flight boarded. Not only did it limit me on my ability to view the safety video before the flight started but it also brings into question why the systems did not work in the first place. The plane seemed fairly new and if the problems associated my electronics was not a simple rebooting of my system according to the crew then what was it that cause all of the systems around my seat to fail?,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,,False

It doesn't make much of a difference on such a short flight - even though you do get better food - but sitting at the front of the aircraft makes the boarding/ disembarking process a breeze.

Air France customer review,8,2014-12-29,HKG-CDG Flight 185. FA's were particularly friendly and helpful. Food and drinks were high standard as usual. Main issues: seat was comfortable enough but lacks the essential for a business class seat: horizontal lie-flat. More privacy would be appreciated as well and there is not enough personal storage room. The cabin was brand new and features the new 2-2-2 seats plan far more pleasant than the 777 2-3-2 configuration. Use of the inflight entertainment system is not really easy and it takes time to navigate through categories and pick a movie. Options are nonetheless plentiful with a good selection of English and French-speaking blockbusters. The Qantas lounge in HKG is definitely not up to the usual AF service in the company lounges around the world. AF should definitely find another partner to accommodate its priority passengers.

Air France customer review,8,2014-12-22,LAX-CDG. After reading so many bad reviews for the AF Premium Economy product I was eager to try it out for myself. If you are like me the thing you hate most about economy is having the person in front of you recline all the way in your lap for the duration of an 11 hour flight. So with that said having shell style seats is very exciting even if they don't recline in the traditional sense. Upon entering the A380 PE economy cabin I could tell right away I would enjoy the experience. The dedicated cabin is small and cozy and the seat itself has tons of room compared to any economy seat. Do not listen to the reviews on here that say the seats are cramped because it's just not true. I have long gangley legs and I could stretch them all the way out to the foot rest under the seat in front of me. It's basically a mini business class seat and compared to other premium economy products out there that cost twice as much (Virgin Atlantic) it is well worth the price of admission. I feel like a lot of the negativity comes from people who expect business class for the extra money they are paying even though it's a quarter of the price. The food is nothing special and I agree that the bottom portion of the seat could use some extra padding. Service was great and the stewards came immediately after pushing the call button. As for the non traditional recline of the seat I found it more comfortable then the normal seat back legs sitting position of economy. The trick is to make sure you extend the calf rest and foot rest so your body is being supported in the diagonal position. Again I feel like other fliers are either use to their economy habitat and or expect lay flat seats that they didn't pay for. As I said before not having the person in front of you laying in your lap the entire flight is heaven on earth which is still a problem on many PE products. Please take it from me a rational realistic aviation aficionado. I speak the truth in all my reviews and would not hesitate to let you know my dissatisfaction if there were any.,False,,,Premium Economy,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,,True

However seat assignment was not permitted as long as the passenger makes the check in online 30 hours prior the departure. I definitely can't say that I agree with such procedure but it's a way to force passengers to do their own check in. Online check-in went fine but I was previously informed by the AF reservation agent that all seats would be available once the system was charged but definitely this was untrue. Anyhow I got seats together for myself and my parents. Once onboard the aircraft was with an issue with the air-conditioning system. So the plane was hot just like a sauna. Only when the main door was closed and the engines started working fortunately we got fresh air. Flight was completely full. As soon as we took off crew started the inflight service. Eyeshade and earphones were personally distributed which was a nice touch. Right after welcome drink which included champagne and a small bag of salty snacks were offered.

After two hours of chatting with each other reading newspapers playing games on their phones and drinking coffee they decided to serve the passengers. Coffee or tea and a very small croissant were served. I expected a bit more on a flight of over three hours. After serving they were gone and I haven't seen them again. Seats were horrible in comparison to my outbound flight with KLM. The announcements were very difficult to understand. And of course they lost my baggage.

Connection in CDG (late evening) a breeze - hardly any other passengers at passport control did not have to go through security again. CDG-HKG an A380. Upper deck economy seating feels much more private - and the boarding process is usually quicker as you get to join a separate line for upper deck (only 8 rows). Onboard service good nice meals for ecoonomy (and even a hot breakfast). bars are set up on both decks with drinks and snacks (ice cream is a nice touch). Seats on AF's A380 are quite spacious - more width than Emirates and ample pitch. Easily one of the best longhaul economy experiences.

The food was OK but the service appalling. No attempt was made to deliver an aperitif before the food but rather had to be requested at the same time.

Air France customer review,6,2014-11-06,Oct 23 AF SFO-CDG-NCE. Economy - reserved seats on SFO-CDG in advance. Chose seats on top level of A380 as there's less movement around the cabin compared to downstairs. FA's were friendly. Food average but was given champagne upon asking. Discovered the 'bar' upon going to the back of the plane to the toilets. Sweets ice cream soft drinks. They don't wait on people much outside of the organized mealtimes but it doesn't bother me to get up and fetch a drink as it's an opportunity to stretch my legs. Boarding at SFO was quick as there were several airbridges and we were boarded first. The problem came from the transfer at CDG. AF changed our flight to Nice because SFO-CDG was leaving later (due to delayed arrival) except they booked us on a flight out from Orly the other side of Paris. The check-in guy at SFO airport managed to change us to a flight out of CDG. However the flight SFO-CDG caught up on the delay and arrived on time in CDG so we then had to queue at the transfer desk to get back on our original flight CDG to Nice! We were dubious about our baggage making the transfer - but it did! AF doesn't match some other airlines but the ticket was cheaper so I'm not complaining. I liked the A380. The CDG-NCE was uneventful with a drink and a packet of biscuits - surely they could do better than that?,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,3,,,True
Air France customer review,4,2014-11-05,LA to Amsterdam via KLM and yesterday October 21 2014 returned from Paris to LA on their partner Air France [AF]. I received an email ahead of time from AF regarding online check in only to be informed I needed a visa or green card and could not check in except at the airport. We arrived 3 hours ahead of departure time went to obtain boarding passes and check in our one bag each only to find it was all done electronically. There were long lines in front of each machine with much confusion and unfamiliarity with the how to navigate the process. One in front of us took at least 10 minutes to complete the process. After 25 minutes we entered another long line to drop off our check in bags which took another 15-20 minutes. At no point were our carry-on bags weighed as they were with KLM. We then walked about 10 minutes to enter the longest line yet which was for passport control and after few minutes were “randomly” selected to go to another line for carry on weight and size control. We observed bags being shoved into a steel frame for sizing. Additionally they added purses and shoulder bags to the total weight calculation which easily put most over the limit of 12 kg. The handlers then slapped a large red AF tag on the bag marked up the boarding pass and sent us back to the baggage area. We returned to the baggage area and discovered the fee for each bag was 70 Euros about $100. When we explained this could have been avoided if our carry-ons were weighed at the same time as our check in as we could have redistributed some items. In the end we had to check in one additional bag. We arrived at our gate as the plane was boarding. While doing so we observed many passengers with 3 carryon bags. We learned many lessons not the least of which is we will not fly AF again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,3,,,False

Air France customer review,1,2014-10-28,My flight was from Atlanta to CDG-Paris on Saturday Oct 11th. I will avoid this airline in the future due to the following: 1) No special meal option-no gluten free vegetarian peanut allergy diabetic etc. meals available 2) Lazy unfriendly flight attendants. Every time there was a tiny bit of minor turbulence they flipped the seat belt light and plopped in the flight attendant seat strapped in and took a break. This happened frequently. I sat near the galley and saw them eating ice cream cake feet propped up. I don't think they ever offered water or any types of beverage during the flight.

I expected an upgraded level of service equal to or greater than Economy Comfort on Delta. The hard shell seat was extremely uncomfortable and the ""recline"" (more a sliding function) did not work. Entertainment options were limited and dated. The food was exactly the same as economy - a mush of potatoes and vegetables with a side of chicken in cheese sauce. The only difference was the addition of an unappetizing brown pate. The second meal service was a stale roll and some yoghurt. The price is outrageous for the level of service offered.

On my return flight to Frankfurt Air France was operating once again but the service left a lot to the imagination.

Air France customer review,3,2014-10-08,I have been travelling with this airline mainly for business purpose and many times in business class. Am I expecting too much when I compare with their magazines and the image they try to carry? All in all I have never been happily surprised by nice new features that modern airlines may offer. Rather it is always more or less the same and in term of seat comfort in business class it clearly lags behind most of its serious competitor. Food is generally good but it can also be sometimes frankly disgusting (when you fly to Paris from a foreign country). Service is fine but seemingly very disorganised between boarding and take-off (flight attendants running in all directions back and forth with no apparent co-ordination - when are going to actually optimize their movements inside the very narrow pathways?).

In spite of flying in economy class and on an awards ticket the chief flight attendant on the CGK-SIN sector personally greeted me. This was as a result of my elite plus Sky Team Alliance status. I enjoy Indian food and had ordered an Indian meal for both sectors knowing from past experience that I would get a very good Indian meal ex. SIN. I was not disappointed with the butter chicken. Leg room was minimal and seat comfort was barely adequate for the 13 hour flight. Cabin crew were professional. In-flight entertainment was adequate but poor when compared to other 4 star airlines.

Air France customer review,3,2014-09-30,"August 9th CDG-YUL on an older B747/400. This review is actually a continuation of my journey from CGK-SIN-CDG submitted in my earlier review. I am submitting this review separately due to the largely different journey experience. Once we boarded our flight we were told that our flight would be delayed due to a surprise inspection from the French Civil Aviation Authority. We were initially told the departure would be delayed by an hour. This was followed by an announcement that the inspection uncovered a technical problem and that we would have to deplane and change aircraft. We received meal vouchers to tide us over. We eventually departed 4 hours late for Montreal but were all glad to be finally on our way. Once on board I was approached by the flight attendant and asked to confirm that I had ordered a special meal. I was looking forward to my Indian meal especially since the meal from the previous flight from SIN had been so good. Instead I received a meal of ""Alaskan Pollack With A Leek Cream Sauce"" which had nothing to do with Indian food. When I mentioned this to the flight attendant her response was merely to say that she was also surprised to see this meal served as an Indian meal. After having eaten the presented meal the same flight attendant returned to me and asked me if I was satisfied with my meal. I politely answered that I wasn't satisfied because it wasn't what I ordered and expected. On the same flight I encountered a flight attendant with completely an opposite attitude who was very helpful in supplying me with ice packs to keep my insulin chilled since they were forbidden from storing my insulin in their on board chillers. This is probably why many passengers speak highly of Asian airline flight crews and often express positive comments about Asian service standards and service attitude.

Air France customer review,1,2014-09-28,First and last flight I will take with them. Had flown London-Havana via Amsterdam with no problem with KLM. Return flight with AF - not so. Firstly flight to Paris was cancelled. Received a text about 16 hrs before flight despite them knowing 3 days in advance. Eventually another plane was chartered via Air Caraibes. We ended up leaving 3 hrs later and arriving in CDG after we were originally due to be in London. In Cuba we were told (rudely) we had been booked onto a flight with BA that was leaving at 9pm meaning we arrived in London 9 hrs after we were due to be there with a 7 hr wait in CDG. Told to get boarding pass from AF desk in Paris. Got there to find 4 staff going at snails pace (again rudely) whilst 300 irate and upset passengers waited to get their ongoing passes. We were almost at the front yet waited 70 mins to be told we had to go to the BA desk 2 terminals away. They didn't actually speak to me by the way preferring to speak to my husband. Got to the BA desk who after trying to get a pass for 2 hrs said AF needed to release the booking. My husband ran back and forth between terminals 2a and 2e 3 times before AF would listen to him and eventually conceded that it was their fault. Did we get any apology?

Air France customer review,1,2014-09-17,My family including my 3 year old daughter had a flight from Paris Charles de Gaulle airport to Manchester which we had booked 8 months previous. We were unable to carry out an online check in before taking flight due to poor wifi signal at our holiday destination so arrived at check in 3 hours before our flight was due to leave to give us plenty of time. When we checked in we were told the flight was already full and we were placed on stand by. After waiting at gate for everyone else to board we were informed that only two seats were available and we could split up if we wanted or stay as a group of 3 on the next flight to Manchester. We decided to stay as a family - we went to the customer service desk only to be told that the next flight was completely full. After spending an hour at the desk with a very bored and upset young child we were informed that the only flight we could take that day was to Birmingham over 90 miles away from Manchester where our car was parked. After 11 hours in the airport we departed - on arrival to Birmingham we then had to organise transportation at considerable cost to ourselves to Manchester to collect our car.

Air France customer review,4,2014-09-06,I flew Air France with six different legs of a European trip in August. Each time we flew into CDG. Fabulous employees. But not one departure left on time. Departures varied from 20 minutes delayed to over an hour. Missed one connection due to this and twice my daughter's wheelchair was lost and finally located again but we were always last leaving plane. Our luggage was lost for one and a half days on our first leg of trip (CDG to Manchester UK) because the flight left Boston so late we were connected to a smaller regional aircraft due to arriving late in CDG thus missing the scheduled Air France flight. In Boston we were told to get our boarding passes for the flight to UK in Paris. In Paris they asked for our boarding passes and it took over an hour to resolve that we were told to get them in Paris and that was the first leg of our disappointing trip. Again wonderful staff but it seems one airport location does not communicate well to another location which then uses up a lot of time at help desks at each airport trying to resolve the issues. The only time our delay was acknowledged was on our last leg of trip back to Boston - this left 20 minutes late which wasn't too bad but we sat on tarmac in Boston without much information for over an hour. The next day we got an e-mail from Air France apologizing for that. But the other five legs of the trip also were with problems.

Paris CDG terminal 2E had serious problems with their toilets. 2 or 3 male's toilets had been flooded. I was lucky enough to select a seat at the back and I had the whole row to my disposal. However all monitors in the row was dirty from a previous flight. Window glass was dirty. Flight attendants were attentive and smiling. However they provided service twice during 11 hour flight: dinner and breakfast. No drinks offered after dinner. Trays with soft drinks (no wine no beer) had been placed nearby kitchen and staff were lounging in their area. I'm always travelling between Asia and Europe and I booked combined ticket from Bangkok to London by KLM and London to Bangkok by Air France. What a difference!

Flying Bangkok-CDG-Prague and return. It was and is quite annoying that Air France offers online check in however has all seats (apart from some mid aisle) blocked and you are unable to choose or plan all AF is trying to push is seats with more legroom but many fail to realise that these are just by the lavatories and kitchens thus very uncomfortable (lights crowded and many just stand there to stretch). Actual check-in in Bangkok painless and quick the flight was operated by a brand new 777-300 quite tasty food and acceptable entertainment. The whole flight could have been a great one but there has been ZERO cabin crew presence for a 12 hrs flight. Food was delivered fast and it was collected even faster and then no one was to be found. Absolutely speechless when a crew actually refused to bring drinks for a family with kids commenting that there is a bar at the rear galley (the one they failed to announce so few people knew). Return flight uneventful (with much older plane with visibly less comfort and legroom and ancient useless entertainment) and surprised that the transit in CDG was all right except having 20+ passport control booths and only 1 serviced!

Air France customer review,1,2014-08-11,23 July - Jakarta - Singapore - Paris (AF) - Amsterdam (KLM) Premium Economy was fine. However the return journey AF 0254 5th August 2014 - Premium Economy Paris - Singapore - Jakarta was extremely disappointing frustrating and uncomfortable. Despite several attempts before leaving Jakarta to check-in online and select seats and again prior to our return flight this was not possible (yet online check-in from Jakarta - Paris was no problem). Seat allocation on check-in at Amsterdam Schiphol noted 'SBY' having been allocated by Air France. We presented to 'Customer Service' CDG to be told seats cannot be allocated until close of the boarding gate because 'standby' had been allocated - why? we booked our flights in May 2014! At the Gate we were told to wait until boarding was called that we would be on the flight and they were hoping to upgrade us. When we re-presented as advised we were told an upgrade wasn't possible but we 'could' be allocated separated premium economy seats - for a couple married 36 years on a 17 hour flight - this is unacceptable! No-one was able to do anything - the ground staff person was surprised we were unhappy and said an upgrade was not promised. The flight crew re-allocated us seats together but then an unhappy traveller arrived to find one of us in his seat - embarrassing for us and for him. This gentleman did agree to being re-seated. Anticipating a problem for the final leg of out journey (Singapore- Jakarta) we asked the cabin crew who shrugged and said yes there would be a problem; the ground staff in the Transfer area said the plane is full and no it was not possible for us to sit together. This is a short flight so no real issue - however my husband had an empty seat beside him so he asked and I was invited to move - but no- one actually considered this! In fact there were at least 3 empty seats in Premium Economy - it seems that neither the ground staff nor the flight attendants have any idea of the seating on board their flight.

Good selection of movies (including kids) but not as many as Singapore or Emirates. Cabin temperature was very cold on both outgoing and incoming flights. Got a premium economy upgrade on boarding on the return leg. This meant a very comfy seat and nicer food. The boarding started on time but the boarding went very slowly and the flight took off around 30 mins late with no explanation from staff.

No phone numbers were provided of personnel who could assist us with rescheduling nor were we able to call the local customer service number as they close in TLV at 5pm and this was past 10. We Skype'd with customer service in the US and were told that we had been rebooked on El Al - which is great but someone could have told us! Anyway we flew out of TLV with El Al to connect in CDG to SFO and the flight was uneventful. Old ugly plane with seats that have no support or leg room (I'm 5'10"" long legs) and a horrible entertainment system. The stewardesses tried that has to be said but their service was perfunctory at best. I think the main problem is that it honestly feels as though AF doesn't care about their customers that they're a source of revenue and that their travel experience just simply doesn't matter to the company.

Flight departed on time boarding times were good considering that the plane was an A380 (still however if you do not like waiting to board on long lines then I suggest you take one of their several other daily flights). Food was free and decent legroom was pretty good. Crew were friendly and professional. My baggage arrived in CDG with the flight. Didn't have to pay for my first checked bag (I would suggest trying to fit everything into one however as the second bag is expensive). My only complaint is that I had checked in online and only had to drop off a bag at JFK's check-in desks but the line was huge and it was not apparent that there was a separate line for people like me.

Service from CDG-YUL was a joke not even a drink served until we were over Irish airspace such a disorganized serving of dinner it was laughable. Attendants were stumbling over them selves serving trays and than I just got one passed to me from behind with no words or choices but it was very tasty and the portions were just right. All other requests were self-serving. The 777-300 was horrible no legroom and very cramped A340 old and falling apart but much more comfortable with the exception of the middle 4 seats they were empty but fixed armrests prevented you from getting comfortable and sleeping flat.

We were able to select seats by checking in on the Air France website which was easy to use. Check in at CDG was a nightmare - I don't think I've waited this long for economy check-in - the fact that this was business class (in the sky priority area) made it really bad. There seemed to be about 6 counters open for all of Air France business class at CDG (hundreds of people - huge line snaking on for ever). No priority pass for customs/security. Lounge was good (see separate review). 777-200ER plane full in business. Service was excellent - excellent staff polite and efficient. I quite like the seat - although its not horizontal quite comfy for lounging some minor acrobatics had to be performed if you are not on the aisle and need to get over someone who is fully stretched out. Food was acceptable for plane food although they did run out of my choice (sitting in 4K). Champagne was delicious (Ayala) and they set up a self service bar in the galley - very much preferred to constantly pressing the call button. No priority pass given for customs at SGN.

Air France customer review,10,2014-05-26,NCL-CDG-BOG-CDG-NC.L Decent fare during Air France sale and added benefit of avoiding overnight stay in MAD or transit through PTY with KLM. A little apprehensive after reading a few past reviews. Air France treat you excellently in Affaires and it does feel a little like business class used to be - something special. Short hop from Newcastle on time - nice breakfast served and CityJet crew couldn't have been nicer. We'd been warned about transit at CDG with most saying that 90 mins 'wasn't nearly enough' to make the connection. Arrived and left out of 2E which is clean and modern with easy signage. The flight connections centre has lots of screens detailing the departure gate of your next flight. With Sky Priority everything we were through security in 3 minutes and in the lounge at 2E within 20 mins of landing (you don't need to clear passport control as UK is outside Shengen anyway). Lounge at CDG nice although slight absence of food but we weren't hungry as had just been fed. Boarding onto Airbus A340 with Sky Priority was pain free. Welcomed on board by charming and good- humoured crew. Despite the age of these aircraft the cabin looked and felt new. The seats were very comfortable and nearly full flat - just off 180 degrees horizontal. I'm 6ft and had no issues getting a great 4 hours sleep. Food-wise we were welcomed with champagne and juice. Shortly after our on-time take off menus were brought round. The amuse-bouche followed (more champagne) cold salmon starter choice for 4 mains cheese desserts and digestifs. A buffet was set up at the rear of the cabin and crew were on hand if you needed anything. There was an Express option of meals if you wanted it. The only minor gripe I had was that there are only 2 toilets in business class cabin. In Bogota bags off in 10 minutes. Return trip much the same - Air France uses the LAN lounge which was excellent. Crew couldn't have been better and inflight services were all excellent. The IFE doesn't have the range of Emirates but had enough recent films/TV to keep me going. I prefer the personalised service at AF over robotic EK crew. While I can get by in basic French (which was appreciated by staff) my travel partner was English speaking and was treated equally well. I'd recommend AF business to anyone for a long haul trip and CDG was a dream to transit through (although may be a different story in economy).,False,,,Business Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,,True

We checked in on time with two suit cases for our short journey to Paris (CDG). Flight was enjoyable however the breakfast was poor croissant stale service slow. There were no signs at CDG telling us where our next connection was. All it needed was a screen at the exit to show the flights desks and connecting details. It left us wondering around between L & D2 and the Duty Free. Fortunately the plane took off late so we did not miss our connection. However the reason why it was late some passengers did not check in so bags were unloaded (including ours as we later found out to our cost) and on arriving in Tunis one of our bags was missing. After a long wait in the baggage hall we  with several other passengers who had the Air France experience reported the loss but as no one there could speak English we left hoping that our bag would be sent on to us.

Like the experiences of other reviewers here after the first meal had been cleared away the crew appeared once with water and once with ice-cream then disappeared before serving breakfast. Meals were poor but a selection of snacks (hot soup sandwiches cookies and drinks) were available in the galley. The entertainment system was a disappointment after flying this route several times over the last years with other airlines. The personal screen was small and hard to see and movie choices very limited especially for children. My biggest complaint was the standards of cleanliness. The plane was obviously quite old (with ashtrays still on the doors at the back) and looked a little worse for wear (toilets looked particularly grubby) but there is no excuse for the lack of cleaning. When I unclipped my try for the first meal there was a used tissue stuck in there and the tray was covered in crumbs. Someone had either been sick over or spilled their lunch over the (very bulky) airline magazine in the seat pocket of my daughter leaving it sticky and smelly. Somehow staff were unable to regulate the temperature in the plane and it was quite cold (other passengers wrapping themselves up in whatever they had with them)- aside from 45 minutes or so in the middle of the night when the heating system had obviously been turned on full-blast and the cabin turned into an oven. The blankets looked very tatty and dirty and when released from their meaningless plastic bag proved to be covered in thick long black hairs. I opened all the bags of our party of four and they were all equally as filthy so went unused.

Only the middle seat is not free as in Business. On my flight from CDG to SFO the crew were very friendly the food was good and the PE seats provide a lot of private space. I could sleep for a few hours but people who complain that the shell seats are too hard will be pleased to hear that AF also replaces the cushions in the A380 seats (and improve the touchscreen). You get an amenity kit sky priority boarding and check in plus a slightly better main meal. No pre-flight cocktails and certainly not the enhanced catering as on Air New Zealand. However if you need to work and/or want to watch a few movies in a comfortable environment and cannot afford business class then AF PE is definitely worth checking out.,False,,,Premium Economy,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,,True

Long awaited vacations had to be cut short by this whole day as even though we were in their head quarters in Paris they had no airplanes to replace this. We had to wait in a bed and breakfast next to the hotel for the whole day and night and Air France offered no compensation terrible customer handling no one properly explains anything their personnel are rude entertainment screen for my husband did not work on the flight the staff are surprised by upset customers. We flew the next day wish we had never flown with them just a ruined start to a long awaited vacation and no customer service considering that we paid over 2000 euros for the flights.

Not the efficient service we are used to in Singapore! On return flight we experienced bad turbulence (worst we frequent fliers had ever experienced). At no point did the captain speak to the passengers to apologize explain or reassure and as it was night the FAs were nowhere to be seen. Furthermore 3 TVs for my family of 5 were not working and all the FAs did was repeatedly restart the system. We asked to change seats as plane was not full but had to organize with with other passengers to ensure our kids weren't sitting alone.

Air France customer review,6,2014-04-06,As a Delta Platinum member who flies mostly on Air France I was astonished when Air France took away my wife's seat and put her on a waiting list when traffic kept us from arriving at the airport in Paris until 90 minutes before the flight. This was despite our being on the same reservation - with an 8 year old child with us! I was told that a Flying Blue Elite Plus member would have been treated the same way which is even worse than thinking it was an aberration. This is the second time that Air France's computer system tried to separate my family. Luckily a very nice agent managed to get this fixed although we then had to run to the gate. Then in the flight the food was truly the worst we have ever eaten on an international flight. My son and I ate almost nothing during an 11 hour flight.

Flight attendants were impeccable - attentive all smiles efficient present at all times - and more than happy to converse in a variety of languages other than French (including German). Food and drinks were plenty well presented and of high quality. For those who like in-flight entertainment there was an abundance to choose from including lots of music and screens of decent size.

Air France customer review,5,2014-03-07,TXL-CDG-LAX. Both flights on time CDG-LAX on A380 special meal request honored good IFE clean cabin that was maintained during the flight most staff courteous and helpful. Wheelchair assistance requested for both CDG and LAX upon arrival in CDG none was available so my accompanying passenger had to walk the long distance between CDG Terminals 2F and 2L by herself. Somewhat compensated by security staff letting us use the Priority line for passport control and boarding. CDG-LAX: Usually after the meal service the majority of the cabin staff would go to their rest area and the cabin would be darkened. Well not on Air France. Before disappearing the cabin crew left a few trolleys loaded with snacks and drinks in the aft galley so that area turned into the most popular spot on the plane. My seat was in row 45 immoderately after the galley bulkhead so I was pulled into the bar action. At one time I counted about 25 people crammed into the galley area. There were several groups of 3-4 people each who just hung out for what seemed hours kept drinking alcohol and were becoming louder and louder. As all the lights in the galley were left on and as the curtain was open all the time due to the high passenger traffic the entire aft cabin was brightly illuminated and rendered the otherwise great concept of mood lighting completely useless. The economy class purser arrived shortly thereafter and listened to my complaint and then explained that it was airline policy not to provide beverages and snack runs between the meals as most airlines do but to keep the galley fully opened to the passengers for self-service. The party went on for the next 5 hours until the FA's were back and the second meal/beverage service was started. All in all this was a very unpleasant experience showing the complete lack of effort from the FAs and the pursers to rectify a situation in which a passenger was being inconvenienced.

The seat pitch is ridiculously tight 22"" at best. I'm 194 cm tall. It was excruciating for a 12 hour flight. When the person in front me reclined immediately upon boarding my knees were crushed. The catering service was also completely inadequate. The first meal was served within 45 minutes after departure no drinks service beforehand. Instead a tiny bottle of cheap red wine came included on the meal tray. (It appears that the days of receiving Champagne even in economy are long gone.) The food itself was okay but there wasn't much of it. There was no food or drinks service for another 9 hours until a small meal was served just before landing by which time I was extremely hungry. This was a daytime flight which made the lack of service especially hard to fathom. There are drinks and snacks in the galley during the flight but I could not get out of my seat as I was boxed in the window seat by two people who did not did leave their seats for the entire flight and there was no room to get out. Their 777-300 aircraft has a 3-4-3 layout so the odds of finding yourself boxed into one of these tiny seats are quite high. Given the premium that AF charges on this route I will be much more likely to fly one of their Asian or Middle Eastern competitors in the future if this is how cut-rate their service is going to be moving forward.

It's impossible to raise the arms between the seats and the TV screen embedded in the seat in front of you is about 3x3 inches in size and blurry and impossible to watch.

Air France customer review,8,2014-03-03,Flew SCL-CDG-Rome and then back from London. Great experience as usual with them. We only have 2 companies flying directly to Europe one is Iberia (awful) and the other Air France. I choose Air France every time I can despite their prices have been rising over the past 2 years. Food was nice you can even buy a special menu if you want I ordered non diabetic food and it was even tasty! They also provided ice cream beverages and yoghurt during flight. Plus they were very helpful at CDG indicating ways to connect to our next flight. Entertainment was nice too a lot of good options. I tried to buy a ticket for a place with extra room leg for my father but it wasn't available. The only downside I had was that the flight at Heathrow was delayed about one hour so we had to rush (literally run) our way in CDG to not miss the flight home.

Air France customer review,7,2014-03-03,CDG-JNB-CDG. A380s Y class is probably the showcase of AF in this class. AF tries hard to make it a sophisticated experience: excellent IFE with lots of films good headphones for Y sleeping mask nice lights and music small bar with drinks and ice creams… But I was most of all impressed by the crews on both flights: very experienced extremely attentive very polite but with a sense of humour. These FAs like to interact with passengers and do care about their job as opposed to the robotic FAs of some airlines! One the downside meals were very disappointing and limited not sophisticated at all they used to be much better.

Air France customer review,2,2014-02-24,CDG to Riyadh in Y class on the A330-200. This was one of the worst travel experiences I have had in recent years. I booked with Saudi who codeshare on this day of the week and went to check in at the Saudi desks in 2C. This was a mistake but Air France counter staff nearby were rude and unhelpful. Their customer service skills were so poor. Air France insists you use the automatic check in when travelling in this cabin but after queuing and following on screen instructions the machine then prints a notice telling you to go to the desk for traditional check in. Boarding was ridiculously slow and badly handled. Scanners failed to read every other card and just two agents on duty had to input details manually. The flight was scheduled for 1330 and was full but boarding did not begin until after 1300. The Y class seating configuration is grotesquely cramped. Seats are narrow with very little space. Should the passenger in front recline their seat the minuscule television screen will be almost touching your nose. Riyadh is not an especially lengthy sector but six hours in these tiny and packed rows was five hours too long. The seats cause real discomfort. The meal was only just hot and not pleasant and the red wine offered was very poor quality. Cheap plonk. Crews had barely enough space to move the trolley. Air France makes much of the glass of champagne it offers to all passengers but every other aspect of the service was very unpleasant indeed.

Positive points of Air France Premium Economy: Seat is very spacious provides enough space for the arms and you can comfortably stretch your legs. Food is nice with starter and dessert. Negative points: The seat's padding: it feels like not existing and it is like sitting on a hard chair. By sitting on the provided blanket it is bearable for a long haul flight.

Premium is great service excellent (same service and food as business). Premium seats very comfortable slide forward rather than recline pitch 36"" on their B777-300ER Caribbean routes (other routes it is 38"") but the width and armrests make a huge difference and the TV screens same as business.

Air France customer review,3,2014-02-10,AF256 CDG-SIN. The return flight was a bit better due to a more pleasant set of crew although I do feel the level of engagement with passengers is lacking and crew members just doing the minimal task of serving the 2 meals quickly and then disappearing in between meal service which makes up a good part of the long flight. The real problem with AF is their planes - just not comfortable for long haul - cramped seating 3-4-3 in a 777 aircraft in a full flight feels suffocating crowded very unpleasant and the inflight entertainment needs a major upgrading - small screen with blurry images that keeps hanging and limited selection. There is also no extras like an ice cream after main meal or selection of snacks and fruits in between meals. In fact the food served is terrible one of the worst ever experienced. I was left very tired and hungry. The scrambled eggs served for breakfast was so overcooked and heated it was like puddle of yellow mud with a small sausage looking awkward in the mess. I think it gives the impression of no care given. That about sums up my experience with AF.

The staff are always accommodating and friendly the food good and plentiful the seats on the A340's comfortable and all flights were on time. My biggest complaint for a very long haul flight is that the IFE is not good enough for the price the Business traveller pays for the entire package. It is lacking functionality and lacks any decent programming content. Simply not on par with BA/Virgin etc. I had browsed most of the IFE on my previous return long flight BKK to CDG and to my horror same old so called entertainment system on both legs of CDG-BOG and BOG- CDG.

Unfriendly and indifferent staff all the way. AF/KLM makes no effort to get passengers on their next flight if the incoming flight is delayed. Got a hotel voucher in AMS for a hotel which is up to one hour away from the airport (40min waiting time for the bus + 15 min to get there). You also have to queue twice when you lose your connection: once to get your new boarding pass and again to get your hotel voucher.

No service of drinks/water in between meals one has to go to the back galley for self service for water and snacks - which was also awful limited choice. Crew literally disappears for most of the flight a good 10 hours and appear only 2 hours prior to arrival for breakfast service. Inflight entertainment is a sad looking small screen with blurry images and poor sound system and even worse limited selection of shows. Really I wish there was more positive things I can say about this flight - but it was overall a great disappointment - you know it's not good when you feel like you just want the flight to end quickly and keep looking at the time wishing it will go faster so you can get out!

The cabin crew sat in the galley chatting with each other the whole trip. I bothered the staff by asking if i could get a glass of juice and some snacks. I could not believe what I heard when they said that they had run out juice snacks and sandwiches. Second serving came about two hours before landing or nine hours since we last ate so we were really hungry but the food was pitiful and inedible. The only positive thing on this flight was the IFE.

Spacious aircraft good service pretty good IFE good range of drinks including champagne (digestifs on the menu but they don't come around to offer it) but the food is rather bland. Breakfast not very nice and nasty coffee served with powdered creamer. I woke up 3/4 of the way through the flight due a sore bottom - disappointing that the Prem Eco seats on a new aircraft should be so uncomfortable. Return on an older B777 in economy was actually more pleasant - felt more airy well maintained if a bit worn but cosier somehow with more comfortable seats. Not well equipped for China despite now flying to four destinations and partnering with MU. Only one interpreter aboard no Chinese-speaking cabin attendants. Problematic for a few passengers. Also transferring in PVG is a pain - you need to clear immigration customs and then check-in again (you might have to wait for it to open if longer than 4 hours before departure).

Most windows shields were only opened upon landing this is 10 hours later! During the second meal service (even worse than the first one) a hostess dared wake up the passenger sleeping next to me in order to offer him a tray . I consider this a lack of respect.

The agent visited me in the lounge to make sure everything was ok engaged in small talk escorted me to the plane and introduced me to the FAs. The food on flight out of JFK was average for first class. The seat privacy may not be an enclosed suite but it is far enough from other seats to feel the privacy. I am not a privacy freak American anyway. IFE/TV may not be as good but it is not the thing I care since I rarely watch anything on the flights. Bed quality and size were very good. The lounge experiences in Paris is nothing to compare! Nothing comes close to Air France First Class Lounge experience. The design of the lounge is modern and tasteful. Everybody at Air France First Lounge was friendly attentive. They also leave you alone to give privacy but when you gave the sign that you need anything you get fast/polite/genuine responses. Every agents that will give me some service/escorts came to introduce themselves and engaged in small talks. The massages were very good. The food and wine were also the highlight. Food quality/presentation/taste and service were on par with top restaurants. The Limo escorts to the flights were very nice and made me feel like a king. The agent from the first visit remembered my return flight to JFK. While he couldn't be there that day he sent over another agent to come say goodbye and wished me a good flight while I was seated on the plane. CDG-JFK service was even better the FAs were very professional genuinely friendly and attentive. The food out of CDG was much better. Arrival escort at JFK was good.

There was supposed to be a self service system on board but it apparently ran out of sandwiches and snacks. It was supposed to be haagen dazs ice cream but in fact it was a cheap type.

Air France customer review,3,2014-01-13,Flew LHR to BKK via CDG (Economy) December 2013. Seats very narrow on Boeing 777 and less comfortable than seats on British Airways EVA and Thai Airways which I have used on flights to Bangkok previously. IFE was OK. Food outbound to BKK was good with good wine and cheese. On the return journey back from Bangkok the food was poor with some type of very fatty meat as a main course that I (and my wife) could not eat or even identify. Furthermore after the main meal it was a long long time until breakfast was served leaving myself and my fellow passengers hungry. I later established that snacks were available if you made your own way to the galley to collect them but this availability was not announced and by the time I realised (whilst visiting the toilet) all of the sandwiches and most of the ice creams had gone (NOT acceptable). Cabin crew were pleasant and polite but did not seem proactive in any way and (to me) this was evidenced by the fact that they did not bother to serve the snacks or make any announcement as to their availability. The interconnection at CDG was pretty seamless and posed no problem at all. Given the narrow and uncomfortable seats and the poor catering and associated service on the aircraft I would not recommend that you use this airline for this journey unless BA / EVA / Thai are all significantly more expensive for your chosen dates.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,3,,,False
Air France customer review,8,2014-01-13,LAX-CDG-LAX. A positive experience. On par with the best European carriers. A380 upper deck seats are not state-of-the-art but basically lie-flat and do the job. Big entertainment screen with great options. Service was excellent; lots of smiles and effort to make comfortable. Food was better out of Paris than LA. On return flight plane's engine broke before take-off and airline put all passengers up at hotel for the night; business class got The Holiday Inn.

Air France customer review,7,2014-01-10,Flew from Manchester to Kuala Lumpur changing at Paris CDG the outbound connecting flight was operated by flybe. We did not have seat details for this leg until check in and they seemed very perplexed at the check-in counter about what to do about onward flights in business class. The girl on the desk did not even know where KL was! After boarding the flight there was a problem with the plane and after a wait we were moved onto a different smaller plane and all allocated seat numbers then became obsolete and we ended up somewhere near the back. On the flight from Paris the choice of main course had run out before they got to us on row 7! The food was ok had better and had far worse maybe my expectations were rather high with it being a French airline. The cabin staff were very good. The seats were flat but slightly angled and as a result not quite as comfortable as could have been. I also found the fabric of the seat a bit on the scratchy side and ended up having to put a blanket between me and the seat to make it more comfortable for sleeping. Was surprised on the return leg to find the plane stopped away from the terminal and we had to be bussed in fortunately the plane was on time or this could have made catching our connection very tight. It was a very reasonable price and I would fly with them again if I could not get a good price from the likes of Emirates or Singapore airlines.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,,True

Air France customer review,6,2014-01-07,Flew CDG to PEK on new year's eve. Being a flying blue gold member I'd booked a seat by an exit for extra comfort (at no extra charge for gold and platinum members) but was reassigned to the back in the middle. When I protested and pointed out that I'd booked another seat I was told there was nothing they could do except buy an upgrade to premium economy. The staff was obviously not thrilled to be flying on December 31st and that reflected in their cold rather unfriendly demeanour but that attitude is nothing new to people who fly AF regularly. The worst part is the old outdated barely-hanging-on cabin interior. My IFE kept resetting and the screen kept shaking with 3 second gaps where it would go dark. The rest of the seat was threadbare and the magazine holder at the bottom of the front seat was broken so that a bit of metal kept biting into my knee. When I chose to stand for a while just because my neighbours were infringing on my personal space and because my knee was hurting I was told by a flight attendant to go stand at the back of the plane.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,,False

The staff are always accommodating and friendly the food good and plentiful the seats on the newer A380's comfortable (the older ones are a bit less so) and the connections easy in CDG. All flights were on time. My only complaint is that the seats in business are not lie flat but they are to be changing this on the newly renovated 777s in the coming year.

Wouldn't bother paying the additional to travel Business on such a short flight when PE has the same service. Appeared that Economy was not offered an alcohol service. Drinks were acceptable (champagne offered ) and food was above expectations. Neatly packaged tasty and well presented. 2nd beverage service offered with tea/coffee.

Air France customer review,9,2013-12-30,Flew to Lisbon last minute so I was not able to get a non-stop flight. There were two legs to my trip JFK-CDG then CDG-LIS. Before I arrived at the airport Air France issued us one boarding pass that worked for both our flights. Flight scheduled to leave at 7.15. However the morning of the flight we received a notification that our flight had been delayed 2 hours. Upon arrival at JFK staff were very friendly and updated us. Lounge in JFK was the nicest I have seen excellent food spacious and comfortable. JFK-CDG was aboard an A380. Boarding took place through two gates so did not take as long as I thought made comfortable by the fact that Air France was sensitive to the boarding time and distributed drinks hot towels and an amenities kit while economy was boarding. Staff spoke excellent English and announcements were made in both French and English. Flight attendants were friendly the seats fully reclined and the pillow and blanket were comfortable. Plane was clean and bathrooms spacious. Individual TV's with plenty of choice. Passengers kept well informed throughout. Upon arrival in Paris immigration took about 5 seconds. A little disappointed with the lounge at CDG. Flight to Lisbon delayed 40 minutes. Flight aboard a B737. Service on this flight was surly.

No glasses were provided for the standard quarter bottle of wine. I had to ask twice for a glass. No mineral water was provided as was with the standard meal. The dessert was a soggy tart pastry base with some lemon flavoured mush on it. Bearing in mind we had already paid for a standard meal in the ticket price and were paying extra for this tray Air France should be ashamed for ripping us off in this way.

I have enjoyed Air France for several reasons the past few years on these long-hauls and this flight was no different. They are on time reliable and the food is good.

I insisted right back that 50 minutes is nowhere near enough time at CDG knowing I would have to clear security twice ride a bus and a train and then go through passport screening and one more security check. The A380 was nothing special at all unless you were in first class. There is no economy comfort you just pay extra to sit in the exit row. The flight attendants bring drinks and food exactly twice and no more. The plane is gigantic but somehow they really squished all those seats in there. I don't normally fly this route usually I fly with KLM through Amsterdam and I am always pleased with their service.

The business seat (NEV4 so the latest version so far on AF) is OK in terms of comfort especially for taller people (shorter people may be frustrated in sitting position as they cannot reach the footrest). The main drawbacks are a lack of room for conveniently putting one's own belongings and lack of privacy (especially compared to the CZ business configuration which we had on the A380 from SYD to CAN which is great in terms of private space). Catering OK although no choice for the starters (this should be improved). Good choice in terms of drinks and possibility to access a bar at all time during the flight. Possibility to have a quick dinner service (without main course) thanks to a very efficient flight attendant; that was very appreciated on a night flight as we were keen on sleeping as soon as possible (and even more appreciated considering that the dinner service with AF is usually way too long). The IFE is a little bit poor and the user interface is not very friendly (the way of listing the movies for instance should be improved - it always takes a lot of time to go through the whole lot).

In the bathroom there were Clarins face products and cotton pads to freshen up. Menu selection and food was very good. Alcoholic beverages are standard. After the meal we were handed a plastic container with a great selection of bon bons.

Then after this service the window blinds were pulled down and the lights were dimmed (in the middle of the afternoon!). There was no further service until l5 minutes before midnight - a duration of some 9 hours! when a dinner was served. The pursers vanished (to sleep?). Someone came round with an ice- cream on a stick at some stage. Why Air France wished to turn day into night on what was a day flight that arrived in Paris at the end of the afternoon is beyond me. Why they should consider that a break in service of 9 hours is acceptable is beyond belief. What they have done of course is to use the same service timetable as that for the flight out - which made sense in that context as it was a night flight arriving early in the morning of the following day. Under those circumstances it was logical to give passengers the chance to sleep undisturbed but not for daytime flight.

Air France customer review,6,2013-11-10,Paris to Boston in business class. The plane and seats were great except one toilet was not working and closed. The main issue was lack of clear English announcements. Even though the flight was coming to Boston but there was nothing in clear English. This made the situation for us painful. We were served with some appetizers mainly duck. I did not like it and the hostess made a comment in broken English as if I was not hungry. When the main meal was served she did not include me as if I did not need anything to eat in a long flight. My wife sitting next to me was served that main meal while I was talking to her. Before landing they served something that I can only describe as least desirable. It had a tiniest of half a sandwich without any meat or egg. A big cup of heavy marinated fruits.

Beside that by now we all know what a great design this A380 is and how much more peaceful it is inside this airplane when flying. The reason for my comment this time is the very noticeable improvement by AF crew and AF catering to put in an effort to take better care of passengers. AF crew are usually always very polite they seem to enjoy their jobs again. Catering has improved again and food quality is very close to what I remembered it was so many years ago and one of the reasons I became a regular customer of AF.

Air France customer review,8,2013-10-29,AF275 Tokyo-Paris CDG. Rather small and non inviting lounge at Narita very limited choice of food and drinks (comparing to Delta's Crown Room next door). Flight delayed for 4 hrs due to tech problem but all passengers were kept informed some snacks and drinks were served on board while waiting. After take off decent lunch was served food very nice but surprisingly wines choices were limited and not very good. Seat ok IFE as well snacks soups ice cream were served between the meals dinner before arrival was very tasty decent portions and choice. Excellent cabin crew definitely big plus.

Air France customer review,9,2013-10-28,"From ORY to MRS on March 17th 2013 (AF 6047). The same day the other way from MRS to ORY (AF6006). Same round- trip on August 2nd 2013. ORY-MRS AF 6049. MRS-ORY AF 6006. I've been flying Air France for more than 11 years. Despite some delays due to ATC strikes or technical reasons (mid-exit doors unable to operate on A320 once 3hrs of delays offset by a 4k Miles Prime compensation) this airline fulfills my expectations. I don't fly a lot but I've done almost 50 flights over the years so my comment is based on a true experience. The crews are friendly experienced professional committed to making sure you're alright anytime while onboard. You'll always be welcomed as it should be. However things changed since I first flew them. The seats in short/mid haul flights are now lighter which means you can't stretch out anymore really bad point. Food isn't that bad but always on this flight's type this is a snack more than a meal. Entertainment just doesn't exist on short/mid haul flights neither outlets for your computer. That's why I think prices are sometimes quite high regarding the same flight on another day. Moreover at the 2nd main Paris airport there are a lot of delays mainly caused by the staff of the airport so when you fly from Paris choose the first hub ""CDG"" far from the city compared to ORY (Orly) but way more efficient. To summarize a bit this is French way of life great customer care recent nice and clean airplanes (inside and outside) mainly European made.

If you have tight connections in Paris and are at the back do not book those connect times the airport terminal changes are what seems like miles to walk and then long lines at immigration but once on the plane if you make it the service is the best I have had. The crew wonderful to your needs and the food great and too much to eat really. The snacks between meals and the free wine and beer the best. First rate movies and free head sets to keep you occupied was nice. There is ice cream whenever you desire it.

Air France customer review,1,2013-10-25,As long as you fly Business Class you are good but the Economy Class has very hard seats and after 11 hours your back will hurt. This is probably the same for other airlines. I usually fly from LAX to GOA (Italy) via CDG from two to four times a year. I really wish there were better alternatives but it so happens that Air France has the shortest flights. Once after booking online on their website my trip I realized I made a mistake and although it says that all flights can be cancelled within 24 hours it took a lot of effort to get my money back. They seem to nickel and dime you for every little thing. More than once the flight from LAX was late and my connection was lost. I had to spend the night in Paris at a very cheap motel with bad food and uncomfortable beds. If you have the extra money to avoid Air France cheap accommodation you'll be fine.

Upon arrival in Paris I was in no hurry to disembark (unlike everyone else on board) so spent a little time chatting with the cabin crew and was even invited into the Flight Deck to meet the Captain and First Officer where the flown route was explained in some detail.

Air France customer review,4,2013-09-29,Flight AF084 from CDG-SFO on Sep 21. Boarding from CDG was tricky as always due to unmanageable passengers not respecting boarding instructions. Warm welcome onboard from FAs. Seats configuration was 3-4-3 (B777-300ER) with an awful and uncomfortable seat (mine was in row 23J in the Economy zone). Obviously folks from AF who have designed this seat had never traveled in a 12 hours long-haul flight!

The 777 BC seats are somewhat tired these days and the stupid design means a window seat passenger cannot get past the PAX next door if they are reclined. Food was somewhat poor compared to the trip I made from Shanghai to CDG a couple of months earlier - didn't eat anything on this leg (serving foie gras is just offensive AF).

Very satisfied with the entire flight the seats were comfortable! Flight attendants were friendly and attentive. Once we began to taxi on the runway the personal video screens changed from the standard screen to show a live camera from the cockpit! The video screens themselves were really good. There were no grids and the picture was clear. The sound also worked well. The controls were responsive and there was a really good selection. Impressed with the food. I usually pre-order a special meal but I decided to chance the standard meal. I had a chicken in sauce main course with couscous. I got a nice roll with a good sized wedge of packaged brie a large thick slice of packaged pineapple and a really tasty good sized chunk of brownie for dessert. 1.5-2 hours before landing we got our second meal. I got pieces of seasoned chicken with potatoes and a sauce. There was lemon tart for dessert along with another bread roll and package of cream cheese. The entire flight was enjoyable.

The seat would not stay in its retracted position and I had concerns that this would not be safe. I was most disappointed when this was not dealt with. He returned to say that it would be ok and continued on. The service in general in prem-Eco was less than satisfactory.

Easy check in / boarding due to small plane and few passengers. Changing in CDG between 2E and 2G absolutely without a problem via airside shuttle bus and many signs. CDG-IAD on A380 with mixed results: Economy seats on upper deck are a plus when travelling as a couple - only 2 seats at window with nice little storage compartment between seat and window. Very good choice of films/music on IFE. However for an airplane of 2.5 years of age the interior looks like straight from the 90s: egg-shell-whiteish plastic and a smallish screen. The weirdest thing is that the screen is offset to the left to accommodate the remote control on the right. This makes for awkward angles of head/neck while watching films. Seats quite hard but enough leg room for me (6 ft 6). Crew very nice and open bar in the galleys throughout flight. Still do not understand the boarding process: They started boarding 40 minutes before departure despite 500+ passengers and a more thorough check due to flight to the US. Departure therefore almost an hour late. JFK-CDG in 10 year old 777-200 with the same seats/video screens/interior design. Crew very nice. They recognized me not fitting in my regular seat (albeit officially the same pitch in 380 and 772) so they moved me to bulkhead seats with lots of leg room. Seats very hard. Weird time of serving a good selection of (for airplane standards) good food: After a midnight takeoff they started serving a full dinner despite almost all passengers longing for sleep.

Getting on the flight 3 out of 27 Premium Economy seat were occupied. I politely asked the head steward if under the circumstances I could take a PE seat and he gruffly said that I should have asked on the ground - it was impossible to ever upgrade passengers once on board! No one is actually bad they just don't care and have learned that they can fob off any complaint. Flight attendants do an adequate job of serving dinner then you don't see them again the food on board is also adequate economy seats are expectedly uncomfortable IFE screens tiny.

Air France customer review,1,2013-08-28,Flying from Atlanta to Paris CDG in Economy. We were held on the runway at Atlanta due to thunderstorms. Not the fault of AF but where were the crew? It was stiflingly hot but no sign of water. The menu looked good but the meal was abysmal. The champagne aperitif turned out to be a choice of a long opened bottle of fizz or a plastic bottle of vin de table. Miserable staff who then disappeared until offering a low grade snack before landing.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,,False
Air France customer review,7,2013-08-27,Brussels to CDG and CDG to Narita in First Class on Aug 2nd 2013. I had booked in business but upgraded. Boarded a train in Brussels allowed to wait in Thalys lounge comfortable but basic no service on the train but luggage handed over and rather short trip of 75 minutes in first class. Collect luggage on the platform in CDG pretty quick an AF staff member welcomed us on the platform. Small waiting lounge while our luggage was checked in accompanied through priority immigration and security line then to the First class lounge. Accompanied and driven by car to the plane and introduced to the crew on A380. A nice female attendant took good care of us all through the flight very professional a quick lunch (just a main course and light sweet as I had eaten in the lounge). After lunch I changed into the pyjamas offered coming back to my seat the FA had turned it into a bed with mattress soft pillow and comfortable quilt. Nice breakfast of apple pancakes and tea. After landing first to disembark welcomed by AF staff priority lane for immigration and by the time we entered luggage hall our case had already been collected by another AF staff waiting for us with a luggage cart. All in all a very good experience.,False,,,First Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,,True
Air France customer review,8,2013-08-27,Paris to Washington (IAD) in economy on August 27. We had a pair of seats aisle + window with a convenient individual mini-storage bin by the window on top deck of Airbus A380. Extremely quiet and smooth flight. Aircraft very clean and in excellent shape. Reasonably comfortable seats with small footrest and excellent video/audio selection (wide music selection and at least 30 movies to chose from in a variety of languages). Departure delayed a few minutes due to a couple of passengers showing up late. Crew was pleasant and helpful. Food was average for economy. Open bar in the rear throughout the flight is a definite plus. All in all a good experience. Value for money was top by definition: frequent flyer award tickets earned in Delta FF program (yes FF tickets can be had even in high season at least when you book 9 months in advance).,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,,True
Air France customer review,8,2013-08-26,Flew with them back in February and March. One is ABZ-CDG. Another one is CDG-ZRH. Both are returned flight. Enjoy all the flight even there was nothing much to comment as they were all short flight. Check-in at Zurich was nice as the staffs checked through my baggage straight into ABZ even though I bought two separated tickets. Sandwiches snacks and drinks are offered onboard which were alright. There is not IFE. So can't comment on that. Would have been much better to get a proper meal for the price I've paid for.

Air France customer review,6,2013-08-22,August 1st - Minnesota to Paris aboard AF 340-300 flight was great. Enjoyed the larger seats and more leg room food was average wine with and after dinner was good. The air-conditioning in the airplane was not working correctly so we sat on our blanket and pillows which offset the hardness of the seat. After dinner we were offered liquor flight attendants were friendly and accommodating. Since we departed at 8pm shortly after dinner the lights were turned off encouraging passengers to sleep or take advantage of the in screen entertainment. Screen size was exceptional big and easy to watch movie and TV selections were average. Breakfast was served about an hour before landing again the food was just average. Would fly AF Premium economy again absolutely so much better than economy.,False,,,Premium Economy,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,,True
Air France customer review,4,2013-08-22,August 21st Paris to Minnesota aboard AF 340-300. Flight delayed an hour because of a problem with the air- conditioning. Once again we enjoyed the larger seat and extra leg room. I especially like the option which allowed me to raise the seat front to support my calves. When dinner was served; my choice of chicken was quite good while my husbands choice of risotto was not good at all. Flight departed at 1.50 pm the lights were dimmed after dinner to enable passengers to get some rest. Attendants came through 3 or 4 times offering snacks and ice cream as well as additional drinks. The entertainment options were exactly the same offered on our previous flight. Once again we did not need the blankets so we sat on them which compensated for the hardness of the seats. My only complaint is the handling of our luggage. One of the advertised benefits of booking and paying for premium economy is to have your bags tagged priority’ which is supposed to insure prompt delivering upon arrival. As I stated our flight was an hour late departing therefore we only had 45 minutes to make our connection in Minnesota. We were traveling with friends who did not opt for premium economy. We both checked in at the same time. Upon arriving in Minnesota our bags which were tagged priority were definitely not delivered in a timely manner. In fact many non priority bags arrived long before ours; including those belonging to our friends to flew economy. As a result we barely made our connection (2 minutes) our bags did not.,False,,,Premium Economy,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,,True
Air France customer review,2,2013-08-21,CDG-VIE took this morning flight and it's so disappointing to see the standards drop so low. For breakfast if you don't drink Tea of Coffee it's Bread (croissant) and water no juice of any kind. Crew look suitably embarrassed. And you have for the inflight entertainment the reading of their Air France magazine. The paper cup and napkin is collected in a rubbish bag very quickly after serving and then the crew disappear.

Air France customer review,1,2013-08-13,Frankfurt to Clermont Ferrand - connecting in Paris with both segments on Air France. Connection requires you to switch from terminal 2F to 2G in Paris which involves exiting the airport taking a shuttle and going through security again. My first flight was slightly late as a result I got to the gate 10 mins before departure. They refused to let me on supposedly they close the doors 10 mins before departure. Granted I am a frequent flier the flight probably does not have more than 2 dozen people on it I was already checked in and on my way from the other terminal. You would have thought they would make an effort. Unfortunately that's a recurring problem and since they have a monopoly on flights to smaller French airports like Clermont Ferrand they could not care less about what people think. I absolutely do not recommend this airline to anyone. Very high prices terrible service no consideration for customers. If you can avoid it I recommend you do so.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,,False
Air France customer review,9,2013-08-12,Singapore to Paris return. Arrived at Singapore airport and read an email saying my family of 5 had been bumped and told to come back the next day. After speaking/begging with a very helpful Air France rep we were put on a Singapore airlines flight leaving roughly the same time. Flight back from Paris to Singapore on an A380 was great excellent cabin staff who were extremely pleasant and helpful with my young children food was good plenty of drinks entertainment was a bit limited for adults but the kids loved it. Overall preferred the Air France flight home more than our unexpected Singapore airlines flight over.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,,True
Air France customer review,5,2013-08-12,CDG-Dusseldorf. Check in was quick with the machine and involved zero interaction with staff. Lounge was basic but I guess it is normal since they have only European flights from Terminal 2F. Boarding as usual is chaotic but Priority boarding announcement was still made less than a minute before general boarding was called. Once on board fantastic friendly and elegant purser welcomed and greeted passengers. For the price of the ticket the catering was awful with cold tasteless amuse bouche served. Seats are all the same across all cabins with 2 rows of business class (2 passengers sharing 3 seats) and a row of premium economy class (3 passengers on 3 seats) then a curtain separating economy class which gives an extremely cramped and stressful feeling. The cabin crew did their best but honestly the hard product let everything down.,False,,,Business Class,,,2,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,,True
Air France customer review,5,2013-08-12,ATL-CDG 7/13/13 B777-300. Take off and landing on time etc. Nothing special or terrible to report. I thought the business class on Air France although not bad is also not good. Seats recline OK but not especially comfortable. The 3 across the middle of business class seems outdated to me these days. The food was terrible for business class. Terrible fish horrible cheese wine selection OK. Overall no reason to compliment or complain and given the ticket price I think I was just about getting value for money.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,3,,,True
Air France customer review,8,2013-08-12,Return trip Hong Kong to Paris. Outbound flight was delayed 1.5 hours but landed close to on time.

Air France customer review,1,2013-08-05,Upon checking in at Bangkok I was told I would have to pay $100 US for an a second checked in bag despite only having 20 kilos. I have travelled on international flights for 35 years and have never heard of this policy. When I requested an emergency exit seat as I am over 6 ft 3 I was told all these seats were taken and anyway they cost 70 Euros extra. On boarding I observed 2 empty emergency exit seats. Finally I was dismayed at the on-board food they served and expected a lot more from their national carrier from a country that supposedly has some of the best cuisine in the world. I could not eat the food as it was stale and tasteless. All I could stomach on a 14 hour flight was a very small ham roll.

Air France customer review,1,2013-08-05,Arrived at CDG 3 hours before flight with my young daughter to be told that our flight home was overbooked and that this wasn't unusual as Air France overbook all of their flights. We were handed standby by boarding cards and 3 hours later at 9pm it was confirmed that we wouldn't be able to board the plane by the most bored looking ill mannered unhelpful and unsympathetic customer service representative I have ever encountered. We were eventually taken elsewhere and issued with a voucher for a hotel and meal. We were vaguely pointed in the direction we needed to travel and told that with children it would take about 45 minutes to get across the airport to the hotel shuttle bus stop. After a torturous trek across the airport we eventually got to the bus stop and then to our hotel so late that the restaurant had long since closed and the only food available was from a vending machine.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,,False
Air France customer review,7,2013-08-04,CPH-CDG-MIA / JFK-CDG-CPH. I upgraded to Business class on the CDG-MIA flight operated by an ageing 747-400 but everything worked just fine cabin was clean and seat comfortable. JFK-CDG was an A380-800 aircraft. We had a delay of almost 2 hours on departure from JFK due to ATC but captain kept us informed and was very apologetic. In general food was good but it could be better. Flight attendants were outstanding especially on both long haul flights they were just some of the best I have ever had. The worst was that I missed my connection at CDG and the customer service agent wanted me to wait for 6 hours when there was an available flight 1.5 hours after our late arrival.

Seats not up to specs for business class especially CDG-SVO where the legroom is smaller than in some competitor economy cabins. CDG-SVO delayed 2hrs due to technical problem and then another 35 minutes for wrong catering being loading onboard. Overall below expectations and not fair value for money paid.

Air France customer review,4,2013-07-30,IAD to CDG continuing on to DUB. A380 upper deck 62F. Seat is nice when sitting but for sleeping it is just dreadful. Not flat the headrest is apparently made of marble so your head actually hurts when you use their flat pillow to sleep and heaven help you if you are in the window and your seatmate is sleeping. The pitch is far too skimpy for comfort. Food and beverages are fine - although I don't understand why you have precisely two hot meal choices on an A380. The amenity kit is poor. The service was surprisingly friendly and good on this flight - I will give them that. CDG is the predictable mess - delays lack of information and the busses to shuttle you to connections so loved by Euro airports. When you have other options that have flat seats (Delta BA Brussels etc) and don't have to go through CDG I can't fathom why I would continue to take AF. On the bright side it was better than the last time I flew.,False,,,Business Class,,,1,3,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,2,,,False
Air France customer review,4,2013-07-29,LCY-Nuremberg. City Jet owned by AF. Like using LCY as it's quieter classier than other airports. However disappointed with seat space and sandwich options on flight. On time. For return wanted to investigate changing flight. Ringing phone line from a mobile in Germany - god knows how much it has cost. Couldn't speak to anyone despite numerous tries. You actually get cut off if they decide too long a queue this happens after menu options so waste money and have to call later. Then when connected again held in a queue for 7 mins then gave up. Went online put details in you go round in circles on the website clicking modify flight etc this just to find the cost of changing.

Air France customer review,8,2013-07-28,DEL-CDG-ZRH and back by Premium Economy in June-July 2013. Pros: 1) Priority access for check in (all airports) security (all except DEL) passport control (all except DEL) boarding (all airports). 2) Additional baggage allowance. 3) Comfortable seats with large screen good sized tray tables USB charging points at each seat. 4) Personal amenities kit given. 5) Business class seating (with meals) on short haul flights within Europe (CDG-ZRH) and back since there is no premium economy seating on these flights. Cons: 1) Have to use economy lavatories. 2) Cutlery is still plastic.

The weather was very poor however the flight was not delayed because of it we were boarded and then sat on the plane for 4 hours with nothing happening.

I was feeling unwell due to heat stroke and asked for a brandy but was told that spirits were not available - only soft drinks water or beer. During the flight I needed water I had to use the call button several times before they came to see what I wanted. Later when I asked for more water the attendant said that I could always get my own.

Going over the food was good (not great) however I noticed how frayed some of the seats in business class were which was just the beginning. Seat is horrible so no sleep for me coming back my tray table was broken (yes in Business class) so I had to prop it up with my knees as I didn't want to sit apart from my daughter.

Air France customer review,1,2013-07-15,I have being flying regularly with Air France for the past 9 years in economy and business class. Normally inflight economy service is excellent with good range of food and beverages available and being offered. On the flight from Paris to Bangkok (July 12) although the plane was newish and with good entertainment the service was absent. The dinner service was a tray with no selection of food or drinks. It contained a pre-packaged cocktail and red wine. No other beverages were offered and no other drinks or snacks offered during the flight. At one point during the flight I went in search of a glass of water not having been offered or provided anything for several hours. I was given a drink and told to go to another galley where I might find ice cream if I was lucky - not even the crew knew what was available. This took self serve to a whole new level. This was one step away from a pack lunch. I chose Air France above other less expensive airlines as I had always enjoyed Air France service and variety offered. A premium airline cannot charge a premium price and fail to provide service otherwise why pay the price when a cheaper alternative provides the exact same thing. I will not fly Air France again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,1,,,False
Air France customer review,2,2013-07-14,Flew DXB-CDG-BCN return. Most uncomfortable economy class flights I have taken. Seat was completely rigid and stiff very cramped. On the return I was it in 35A on the 777-300 at the emergency exit. This was even more painful than the outbound sectors. There was no space between the fuselage and arm rest to actually rest my arm. Had a tall gentleman sitting next to me; was completely cramped with door bustle in front of me so couldn't stretch legs to take advantage of being in an 'aisle seat'.

Air France customer review,5,2013-07-11,ORLY-IST-CDG July 1. I always check in online to save time but shouldn't have bothered for ORLY-IST leg. I was at the airport at 8am for a 10.25am flight. I was misdirected to the wrong bag drop off point. I then joined another enormous queue. It took over an hour to simply drop off my bag. No dedicated lines for just dropping off your bag. There were incredible delays at passport control which was again compounded by a disorganised slow aircraft boarding which appeared haphazard and the plane left nearly 30 minutes late. I had intended have breakfast at the airport but this was impossible due to time delays. On board service was fine but disinterested. The A320 was a little worn on the way back.

We barely made it to the flight and we were all seated separately in the middle seats.

Air France customer review,3,2013-07-07,Travelled in premium Economy and was disappointed with the overall experience. Seats were not very comfortable and the service very poor. The long haul flights catered for vegetarian diet and were of average quality however the short haul (2.5 hrs) did not have any meal suitable for a non meat or fish eating passenger. Staff did not seem to care and made no attempt to find me something to eat.

Air France customer review,9,2013-07-07,Went from JFK to CDG and back in premium economy. Sky priority allowed us to check in and get through security very quickly. We took advantage of the business class lounge (paid about $50 per person) and thought it was well worth it for the food wine and quiet. The premium economy seats although roomier than economy were nowhere near business class standards so do not expect to get a comfortable night's sleep. I did appreciate the extra legroom and the fixed shell design as this made it feel quite spacious.

Excellent selection of beverages although food was quite poor. Prior disembarking and luggage delivery was respected.
