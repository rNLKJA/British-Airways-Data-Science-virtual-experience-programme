Delayed take off, delayed clearance to land, delayed clearance to taxi to the gate. Delayed receiving my bag at Heathrow. This happened at almost every part of the flight which only increased the overall delay. The most insulting part was when the captain apologised for the flight “being a bit late” Many people including me missed their connections and others would have had to book new flights due to travelling on separate tickets.

We were then spoken to and the issue was the same an inoperable seat same offer $500USD or wait a week. The refund was made while arguing with Qantas the manager was only interested in missing the slot. We were advised the Purser would come speak with us, he didn't.

"""In short, the service is diabolical""",1,2022-09-11,"Not Verified |  Qantas Airways has drastically diminished in service since COVID. I flew return in business class to Singapore and there many disappointments along the way: 1) My luggage did not arrive in Singapore. I checked in well ahead of time and my bag had ironically been tagged as first as the desk had run out of business tags. Qantas does not have any service on the ground and relies upon Singapore Airlines in case of lost luggage. I registered the missing bag at the airport, but it proved impossible to get through on the phone to follow up. The website simply stated they were attempting to locate my bag. And it was impossible to gain any compensation. As it turned out my luggage never arrived - it appeared several hours after my return to London, so it would seem it never left LHR and there was no attempt to deliver it to me in Singapore. It was impossible to get any information on compensation and I am still waiting for that. I contacted Qantas via web form, and social media (and attempted via phone). I also attempted to get information on compensation and registered a complaint at check in on my return and at the lounge. The service is appalling. I have received an email from Qantas stating they have tried to get in touch, which is not true, and I attempted to respond and included my reference number but received an auto-reply stating there was no reference number. In short, the service is diabolical. 2) The food / inflight service: No pre-dinner drink/snack and no entrée. For a 13 hour flight and business class ticket at a cost of around £7000 the service is lower than many short haul economy. The main was served on a side plate. I had a glass of wine, and chose cheese for dessert which was served on what appeared to be a saucer! 3) The toilets in half of the plane were broken: The staff advised because half of the toilets were not working they would only serve water for the flight. This seemed very perplexing and it was perhaps that they hadn't stocked drinks. There was no offer of compensation for lack of drinks and as mentioned the drink service seemed very limited from the time of boarding, rather than after a few hours in when the staff said the toilets broke. 4) Running low on fuel: As we came closer to LHR on the return leg, the captain announced that they were running low on fuel and we would divert to Birmingham (which is further north). Again this caused a great deal of confusion. The explanation was something to do with weather, however, by this stage confidence in the airline had disappeared. A short time later the ""fuel crisis"" had somehow been averted and we landed at LHR. Overall a terrible experience and I am still awaiting advice on compensation a number of weeks later and out of pocket having to buy clothes and personal items for a week in Singapore without luggage.

When I went for my pre-departure COVID-19 RT-PCR test, Scoot(no QF!) advised me that there was no code sharing in place with the two airlines, and that I would be unable to transit overnight in Singapore. I had already explained my situation to QF staff who had told me that everything would be fine. I filed a complaint online with QF about 2 weeks ago on their Facebook page. No reply. And there has been a major communications outage in Cebu after typhoon Odette passed through. A week or so ago, I looked at the QF webpage to see what I could do, and they give no refunds, only flight credits. Surely there must be some law against this? I will get the issuer of my credit card to look into this further. All I know is that I will never, ever use Qantas again, even for domestic flights within Australia. Even though Scoot is a budget airline, and despite my recent complaints about their cancellations on me, they at least managed to bring my flight forward and get me home, so kudos to them. Not so keen on the Australian Federal Government for allowing state leaders to chop and change when people are allowed to enter on a whim.

That has now completely gone out the window. I booked flights to Europe a week ago, which took 2 hours over the phone as I was using a flight voucher - customer service rep didn't know how to apply a voucher. Three days later, flight was cancelled and was told by the second customer service rep - this was due to operational challenges and/or airport restrictions, then she told me her Team Leader would get on a call with me, waited another 90 mins and the phone died. Called again next day, 2 hour wait, 45 mins with another customer service rep who I told multiple times, to call me back if the phone dies, guess what - phone died and no call back. Called the next day, spoke with a lady who was based in South Africa - seemed like I was getting somewhere here - said she would follow up with Emirates who was the airline I was actually flying with, and then would call me back the following day. I asked her to promise me - she promised - she didn't. Today - called again and spoke with another non interested customer service rep - explained again for the forth/fifth time and asked to speak to her Team Leader - said she would pass on the message and her Team Leader would call me in 90 minutes - still no call 3 hours later. I still have no flights booked and cannot contact Qantas! This is absolutely not ok and unacceptable. As a Gold Status member - I will not be using Qantas again after this week.

"""never experienced such a bad customer service""",1,2022-03-20,"I booked a business class ticket to Adelaide from Brisbane 2 weeks before departure. After booking I've never received an e-ticket or confirmation per email. I was only able to see my booking online and on the Qantas app. I didn't change any of my existing details with Qantas and on the same email address I've received tickets and confirmations before. After that I've tried to request an invoice online multiple times which ended in receiving an error message. I also tried to call customer service, which I gave up after waiting 1 hour in the queue and the offered call back never came. Before the flight I checked in online which worked fine and received my confirmation of check-in and my boarding pass. Then, 2 hours before departure I received a call from Qantas and they told me the flight is oversold and I have to take the next one, which is 10 hours later or downgrade to economy class. Due to I had to be in Adelaide at a certain time I didn't have a choice and agreed to take the economy ticket, mostly I fly economy anyway. When I asked what the price and the refund is going to be it turned out Qantas charges me $800 for a eco-flex ticket which usually only cost $600, and I know because I have booked that ticket multiple times before and even my return flight is eco-flex for $600. The lady on the phone told me she can only give me the currently available price which of course is much higher 2 hours before departure. So, not only am I downgraded shortly before the flight, on top of that I am punished for Qantas mistake of overselling and have to overpay for a ticket just to get to my desired destination in time without being offered a better deal or any kind of compensation. It's really not nice to feel being taken advantage of because I have a schedule. Unfortunately Australia doesn't have many airlines to choose from and they get away with bad customer service. I guess they need more competition to be forced to improve their services. I never experienced such a bad customer service in over 10 years of frequent flying. 90% of my over 200 flights were done with Star Alliance and they offer great service.

I bought tickets on the official website of Qantas airlines. There was a connecting flight in Sydney: same airport, same terminal, same airlines and only 2h to next connecting flight to Bali. So in Queenstown Qantas staff didn't allow me to board as my Ukraine passport requires me to have a transit visa to Australia even I was not going to go out of the terminal. I supposed to go through transit (transfer) corridor. I have been travelling a lot and I have never experienced the situation when visa is required for transit in the airport same terminal. So of course I didn't know about it. But I accept that the governments of different countries sometimes might have strange rules. The problems were: Qantas did not even try or intend to inform me about my visa either during the booking or prior to flight. It's a special rare case, and I believe, I should have received a notification while booking or after via email. Please, improve your online booking system and add this feature. Its easy to do for your IT.  Moreover, in my ticket is stated ""A visa is permission for a non-citizen to travel to or transit through a particular country. To find out if you need a visa for travel to a particular country, visit the IATA Travel Centre"". So I visited IATA Travel Centre, input all my details and it did NOT say that I have to have transit visa to Australia. Please, check third party sources before you refer there.

Qantas is no longer the ‘pride of Australia’. It is now Jetstar with the flying kangaroo on its tail. Over the past few years, Qantas has become a very poor relative to this once great airline. It is now no more than a low-budget airline that charges full-service fares. What a joke!!! I know Alan Joyce has brought the airline from the brink of bankruptcy to being ‘in the black’ financially but at what cost to passenger loyalty? In fact, after this flight, I will never ever fly Qantas again. There are far, far better quality international airlines than Qantas to choose from that take pride in providing service excellence to their passengers. As for meals and amenities! It was about 9.30pm (approx 1½hrs after take-off) before the meals and drinks cart came around. Why do passengers now have to wait until meal time before the drinks trolley comes around? I’m not a big drinker but a nice refreshment once up in the air would have been very welcome. The menu had a choice of 3 main meals, a vegetable with rice, a chicken casserole with mashed potato, beans and carrot (my choice) and a fish with rice. My meal was tasty but very, very small. This came with a small mousse as dessert, a small bread roll and a choice of an alcoholic beverage. No further alcohol was served. Gone are the days where a good sized food tray came with entrée, main, dessert, fruit and cheese and biscuits. No snacks, not even a small bag of nuts, were served at all during the flight though the menu did state that fruit would be served mid-flight; I saw no evidence of that. We were woken for breakfast approx. 3am Hong Kong time (5am Brisbane time). Breakfast consisted of a small tray of fruit: 2 triangles of watermelon, 2 small wedges of apple, a round of dragon fruit, and a piece of pineapple; a small sweet muffin, accompanied by tea, coffee or fruit juice.

I was very thankful as like most passengers in economy, I don’t sleep well on a flight and earplugs and eye-mask certainly help. As for in-flight service, there isn’t any. From this final experience of flying Qantas, I get the impression that the service and cut-backs in food and amenities is all about cost-cutting ie: keeping costs down and the shareholders happy. There is no consideration for economy passengers in fact, I have the impression that Qantas finds economy passengers an inconvenience and thus are treated as not worth looking after.

My sister and I flew from Toronto to Auckland via Dallas and was supposed to be Sydney but ended up being Brisbane and then finally to Auckland. The return trip was Auckland to Sydney to San Francisco to Toronto. Not one leg of the trip left on time and when we left Dallas to supposedly fly to Sydney we were informed almost immediately after takeoff that we would likely have to stop in Brisbane to refuel as there were strong headwinds over Australia at this time of year and we would likely not make it to Sydney. This extra stop was going to take an extra 2-2.5 hours which meant that we would not make our connection to Auckland. Finally we were told that we were going to Brisbane and that everyone on the plane would have to get off and take a different flight the rest of the way. In what seemed like the most disorganized way possible we were finally put on a flight to Auckland but in the process they misplaced our luggage and when we got to Auckland our luggage was not there and that ended up taking until after noon the next day before they finally cleared it and brought it to us. Then on the way back we got to Sydney ok, but once there the flight we were taking to San Francisco had a technical issue and boarded about 2 hours late. Then we were told when we got on the plane that this was a really old plane and this was its last flight ever! After we got to San Francisco it was going to be taken to the desert and retired; isn't that comforting to hear when you're late getting on a plane because of a technical issue! This plane was so old that the screens didn't even have a flight path so that we could see what time we were due to arrive in San Francisco and because of the different time zones we were going through we had no way to know if we were actually going to make our next flight. The staff at one point came around and told certain people that they were not going to make their connecting flight and they had been booked on a different flight but they didn't have anything for us; they said if they didn't have any information for us that meant that we should be able to make our connection. So then we finally get to San Francisco only to find out that unlike what we were told in Auckland we now had to completely go through security again and re-check our bags which took forever and when we finally got through the customs line and got to our gate we had missed our flight and there was not another flight to Toronto for 7 hours! So we sat and waited for 7 hours and then finally got to go to Toronto, where we had missed the hotel room we had booked because we didn't get there until morning. The manager at the Qantas boarding gate told us that we could put in a claim for this lost hotel booking, but when we did so we were informed that Qantas would not pay for this because they claimed that the technical issue on the plane was not their responsibility. Whose responsibility is it then, is what I'd like to know?!? Also, they ruined one of our checked bags, one corner ripped right open, and this happened on the way there but when we tried to get them to take responsibility for this they said this is also not their responsibility.

"""still room for improvement""",3,2019-03-13,"I have three issues with the Airbus 330-200 business class fight of Qantas from Singapore to Sydney.

I was not able to sleep on my side because my feet were not able to fit the footrest area. All the panels in the new seat are supposed to provide privacy for the passenger but they do also have the unintended effect of making the seats feel much smaller. Lack of toilet - There is only one toilet for the whole business class. There are 28 seats in business class and the business class passengers to toilet ratio must be the worst among all the premier full-service airlines. In the morning after breakfast was served and before the touch down at Sydney, the queue for the toilet was so bad that I did not even get a chance to go before we arrived in Sydney. Those 330-200 with the older version of business class seats have 2 toilets in Business class. I am wondering if Qantas chose to reduce the toilet number in order to fit in more seats. Coffee - The coffee that Qantas serves for breakfast is the worst that I have tasted for a long time. It was too diluted. After milk was added, the colour of the coffee was whitish brown. The coffee was definitely instant coffee. Qantas should invest in a better-brewed coffee machine for business class passengers. Hope that Qantas can look into the above three issues.

"""disgusting response""",1,2019-03-09,"Brisbane to Tokyo via Sydney. Here is an outline of events. Our flight from Brisbane on the 20th of December 2019 was delayed due to bad weather in Sydney. We were then kept in a holding pattern above Sydney for an hour or so, only to arrive in Sydney with a short time to get to our connecting gate. We were madly rushing to get to the new gate, only to find out that the gate had changed (which we weren’t notified of) and had also been delayed while they waiting for passengers being diverted from another flight. Now waiting for another couple of hours in the Sydney airport, we are finally told that the plane has engineering problems. After another half an hour of waiting we are told that the flight is cancelled because either the problem was not fixed or they couldn’t take off, as it was too late. My family and I then waited to find out what was happening next. After they had seen to all the local Sydney residents, we were next told that we were being put up in a hotel. When we arrived at the apartment, we were told that they couldn’t check us in because the Qantas credit card had been declined. At this time it was after 1am in the morning and we had been travelling for 8-9 hours. As a 6 person family, I was surprised they put us in an apartment that slept 4 people. Two of my children had to sleep on the floor. The hotel was not able to supply any roll out beds. We were also told that we had a $50 to spend per person, however when we arrived at the unit, there was clearly no where to get any food. So I had to go for a walk to find a Nightowl convenience store to find some food for the children. Likewise in the morning there was nowhere to find breakfast so I had to go out and find somewhere, being unable to use the credit vouchers I was told we had. During this time we had received no communication updates from Qantas with regards to our flight that had been rescheduled. When we arrived at the airport, I approached a Qantas person to check in our luggage. They directed me to another location, which we all followed. Upon arriving there, (I believe it was the standby counter) we were told that this was not the place and directed to another place. When we arrived there, we got in a queue to check in our luggage. About 15 min into the queue, a Qantas supervisor started coming over to us, yelling and shouting at us in an extremely unprofessional and disgusting way, telling us we were in the wrong place and that this counter was shutting. To which we informed her, that we had been directed by another Qantas staff member to come here. Eventually she allowed us to stay. However 10 min later, another family was coming over, which infuriated the Qantas supervisor even more, and again another shouting session occurred. She continued to complain loudly enough for everyone to hear, how bad it was that people were coming over. The other group was actually being accompanied by another Qantas staff member. So vicious was the shouting and exchange it brought the other Qantas staff member to tears, which made all of us and our family extremely uncomfortable. After a good deal more waiting we finally were at the stage of checking in our luggage. Only to be informed that they could check us in, but we needed to take our luggage somewhere else – to the oversized baggage section as the conveyor belt operators had left and it was no longer being used.

The female attendant then queried, ""Your mother?"". ""No, my wife"" I replied, at which she then said words along the lines of ""We were wondering if you two were a couple, my colleague asked me what my gaydar told me about you"".

When I returned to my seat with the water, upon relating the exchange to my wife, the crew member suddenly appeared in front of us, saying ""Are you talking about me?"". Again, I found this behaviour odd and not a little bit creepy. Needless to say neither of us felt relaxed for the remainder of that flight. On the return flight, the female cabin member appeared put out by being asked for the slightest thing. We are not demanding passengers by any estimation, and are well aware that crew members have numerous duties to attend to. However, when the cabin member was walking past me, I attracted her attention and requested a drink for each of us. The reply was a deep and very audible sigh, followed by words to the effect of ""I'm very busy at the moment you know, I have the pilots' dinner to organise"". I stated that I understood, just when she got a chance. However, this ""you're so putting me out"" behaviour was repeated every time we asked for something or had a concern, such as when the lettuce was frozen solid, or when the pork was so tough I could not even cut it, let alone eat it (please see attached photos). On the subject of food, there is some expectation of edibility in all classes, let alone Business Class surely? I'm sure Neil Perry would not be pleased that his ""signature menu"" was so poorly executed. No one in that cabin had edible salad, all were frozen in one lump, and my ""replacement"" meal for the tough pork was beef that was not much better. I was left hungry as I could not eat either meal. When we requested some snacks due to being hungry, the male crew member said ""Oh you want to keep the chocolate? Well, you are a growing girl"".

Business class passengers were asked to board first (after families with young children) and this is probably not a good idea as passengers in economy have to file past and queue through the front cabin in this single aisle B737-800.

Entree was a choice of soup or chicken salad - I elected to have the chicken salad and it was very nice. Not being terribly keen on seafood, I chose the pork for main course, however, it had already run out (as was the case for another passenger) so I eventually chose the prawn and celery roll. It was served cold and possibly the worst airline meal I have ever eaten. Basically it was a hot-dog roll with a few chopped prawns scattered over the top - totally tasteless and inedible. Drinks were topped up from time to time during the meal service, however, more attention was given to passengers after the the meal service was completed which is totally understandable.

First deceptions came as soon as I sat in my seat: reduced room for legs, no USB plug to recharge my phone, small screen with very few interesting movies, meal rests and hairs on my tablet, and no glass holder on the back seat so you are compelled to have the tablet on your knees to put the glass on it. The boarding started an hour earlier than expected which explains why the plane was looking so dirty inside, they probably did not clean it at all despite the plane staying at least 3 hours on the Dubai tarmac. As a result, the boarding was finished one hour earlier than departure time, so we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited, three hours in the plane before takeoff. No green light given by the control tower apparently. As soon as the ascent was done the staff started to get the meals ready and it took them 1 hour for them to get ready with the meals. I somehow had the impression that it was the first flight for the entire cabin crew. Another hour and a half before finally receiving a meal to eat which was OKish but the portion size and meal quality were below Emirates standards. I enquired with the staff about the next time a meal would be served in order to know when I could sleep he said ""I dunno, but you'll get some snacks in a couple of hours"". Yeah, nobody saw any snacks coming during the entire flight, then all cabin staff just disappeared, I have not seen a single one of them during 9 hours. Probably all went to sleep at the same time (very smart move in case there is an emergency). At some point during the flight the sound of the TV stopped functioning for my neighbors and me. The crew came to check and quickly left by saying ""sometimes things just go bad"". Great. I then took the opportunity to look at the entire cabin configuration and it actually looked pretty depressing. Black seats, non-led lightning, damaged trolleys.

My meal was almost cold when I received it, again it was OKish but I just needed to eat something otherwise I would have fainted so I ate it, and the portion size was still bigger than if I would have taken the alternative: an apple.

Two male cabin crew one very efficient and friendly, the ""supervising"" male extremely rude and unpleasant. I would like to seek clarification on a few statements and expectations made by the head of the cabin crew on our flight on the 17th January from Sydney to Wellcamp Toowoomba. Three of us had travelled to and from Perth on business. With only 20 minutes to transfer from one flight to the other, I had purchased three steamed dim sums from the Sydney terminal café precinct. I carried them onto the plane and our team shared them mid-flight when the cheese and biscuits had been distributed by the cabin crew. I had placed the plastic container and the wrappings from the snacks supplied by the crew in a small plastic bag (the one I had carried the three dim sums onto the flight in). When the rubbish was being collected by the cabin crew after all on the flight had finished eating, the cabin team leader said “I will not be collecting the garbage you have brought onto the flight. We have limited space, you will have to keep it on your lap and take it off the flight with you. If there is any room in our trash once I have finished cleaning the cabin, then and only then, will I remove it.” He then walked off leaving the rubbish with me. I was left dumbfounded, wondering what I had done to offend the man. The flight was two thirds full. I was seated in seat 8B beside a large gentleman and, as I am 105 Kg myself, mid-flight I changed seats to the third row from the front where the whole row was empty. Five minutes later the same cabin crew member asked me to return to my original seat. I explained I was cramped with two large men in the one row and that the 8 or so seats around me were vacant so what harm could it cause? The cabin crew member said in a stern voice. “I’m instructing you to move back to your assigned seat.” I said “I have been using QANTAS for 30 years and had never been told that I could not move seats after take-off especially when so many were vacant.” he responded, “The flight needs to be balanced” I said, “when I checked in online there were numerous seats all over the plane that were vacant, I could have picked any one of them, how did you determine who weighs what and then decide where they should sit?” he said, “Return to your assigned seat immediately!” and walked off abruptly. Again I was left shaking my head in disbelief and so were the other passengers on the plane. A number of whom urged me to make a complaint about the cabin crew members rudeness. I now find myself writing my first ever letter of complaint. Can you tell me the QANTAS policy on bringing food and by association, the wrappings onto a flight? Can you clarify the QANTAS policy on moving seats when a cramped situation can be overcome by the relocation of a passenger?

"""seat had very little legroom""",5,2018-01-15,"I flew QF38 from Singapore to Melbourne in Economy only because Emirates (which code-shares with Qantas) was full. The evening meal was so below par - a ""Calzone"" (more like a stuffed bun, about 3"" long) was served in a cardboard box! I would have done better to have purchased a sandwich from the airport to eat onboard - and this is a Full-service airline of some repute! Compared to Emirates or Singapore Airlines, this meal was a real shocker! Even the meals offered by China Southern Airlines were so much better than Qantas' offering. Breakfast was at least the usual rubber omelette with bacon and sausage. It appears the wines accompanying the evening meal were very average, but at least they were Australian. But the coffee (Grinders) and tea (Dilmah) offered were quite good. On the plus side, it was a nice touch that every Economy seat had a small bottle of water (about 250ml) in the seat pocket. Actually, that saves the crew some legwork from having to repeatedly answer passenger requests for water as longer flights like these can make one quite dehydrated, The seat had very little legroom, and it was virtually impossible to find a comfortable position to sleep, especially when the passenger in front had their chair in the fully reclined position virtually all the way. Cabin service, while courteous, was almost non-existent. Unlike many of its major competitors, no refresher towels pre-takeoff and landing, no drinks offered after takeoff, only with the meal service. Despite being an overnight flight, no ""goodie"" bag containing eyeshades, toothbrush and socks were given, unlike SQ or EK. Entertainment was adequate but the screens were quite small, and not very responsive to the touch. I was quite disappointed with Qantas.

The meal was excellent, the choices were good with an excellent variety of wines. The service was professional, courteous and continuous. The only complaint was that the person in front of me reclined their seat back about 1 minute after take-off and kept it in that position for the entire flight. The flight attendant, however, did ask if I wanted the passenger to put their seat upright during the meal service (this is a problem on this type of aircraft with these non-capsule seats). Another small concern is that there is no division or curtain between business and economy other than a small screen above the rear seats in business class. In fact, these rear business seats recline into the economy cabin as there is no bulkhead (but there is plenty of room to recline).

Boarding was quick enough and hassle free. Landed in Christchurch on time and bags on the belt within 10 minutes. My bag was premium tagged and was fourth bag on the belt. Christchurch to Brisbane via Sydney on return was a day of flying I'd rather forget. Our flight to Sydney was delayed by over four hours due to fog at Christchurch and the aircraft being diverted to Auckland for fuel and waiting for fog to lift. As I had an onward connection in Sydney, I inquired at the gate desk with a well rehearsed reply from the gate agent, ""when you get to Sydney, it will be all sorted, someone will be waiting for you at the gate."" Of course, this was not the case, but I did learn that Qantas at Christchurch is contracted and apart from getting passengers on planes, they cannot do much more for you. It was interesting to note that Singapore Airlines Boeing 777 suffered the same fate. Over the PA was announced, ""Singapore Airlines apologises for the delay due to fog etc, we have $20 vouchers for food and beverages."" Qantas passengers were not afforded any such appreciation, and who I might add, had been waiting far longer than Singapore Airlines passengers. Once the Qantas aircraft arrived from Auckland, things seemed to move quicker and soon enough boarding and on the plane. Once departed from Christchurch, the service on board was excellent.

So, after rechecking my bag through to Brisbane on this later flight, I proceeded to Sydney Domestic and waited in the Qantas Club for the hours to pass by. Thankfully a PA announcement requesting passengers from later flights to go on a 4.30pm flight was announced. I took this up.

"""at the bottom of the list""",4,2017-03-30,"✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to Perth via Brisbane. We did encounter one leg with average service; my husband’s morning coffee was served spilt, a few napkins shoved underneath to absorb the mess, basically half a cup of coffee, and no sugar (as requested) – a quick apology was given, but it really shouldn’t have been served this way and accompanied by a cold serve of scrambled eggs. Not a bad run, considering we flew four legs in total. Overall, the meals were pretty good. Of all the Business Class experiences we have had (Etihad, Emirates, Virgin, Air New Zealand and Singapore Airlines), our Qantas experience has landed at the bottom of the list. On our return leg, we had booked row 3 seats in the nose of the plane (747), weeks in advance. A last minute aircraft change saw us separated, so a customer service rep via social media offered us two back row business class seats – the last remaining together apparently – we reluctantly accepted. The very next morning I logged in to check seating again and noticed the aircraft had reverted back to the original. I messaged our social media friend to obtain our existing seats, only to be told ‘bad luck’. Our seats were gone, and we weren’t getting them back. I protested a number of times only to be hit with ‘cut and paste’ replies on operational aircraft change jargon. Eventually, they just ignored me. I also sent a complaint via Qantas online and recently received the same ‘cut and paste’ response about aircraft change. In all honestly, they could have just given our original seats back and kept us happy, considering the above was all within a 24-hour window. The reason we wanted row 3, was that those Business Class seats (FYI) are in the nose of the plane and more spaced / private. We flew over in row 2 and enjoyed the experience. The second part of the 747 is where the seats are 2-3-2. Basically, a very ‘Premium Economy’ experience albeit your bed lies flat. You don’t have a feeling of personal space and can easily bump your neighbour getting in and out of your seating. Two of our legs, we’re flown in an A330; this is a much better aircraft for Business Class, with seating 1-2-1 for personal space, and a nice big entertainment screen on the front seat, as opposed to the small pull out ones on the 747. Unfortunately though, the A330 aircraft cannot be used for long haul flights. Based on the above experience, and at a cost of $20,000 for the return trip, we will not be flying Qantas again for our next journey in June. We have already sourced an alternate airline. I believe our seating error could have been handled better. Unfortunately, we are not Platinum members, so I feel we were overlooked and brushed aside.  Had our original seating, which was booked weeks in advance been honoured, we would have rebooked with Qantas in June.  Do not change your seats with aircraft changes until check in.

On the last occasion and this time, I used QFF points to upgrade from Economy, but no matter how you get there PE is an expensive jump in cost and in the past, it’s not lived up to the hype. This time was different and service was impeccable.  There were frequent drinks top ups and constant attention to detail. I was pleasantly surprised with the food and drink for the most part. Wine was served from full size bottles of decent brands and the dinner out of Sydney was excellent. I’ve heard people say that Premium Economy food is the same as Economy but in this instance the dishes on Q-Eat were I think different between the two classes – I had ordered on both – before and after the upgrade. Anyway, it was a very nice dinner service with all the trimmings served on white linen and felt like a premium service. The seat is not too bad, it’s wide with lots of leg room and I managed a few hours of sleep up to Dubai. For solo travelers 24A and 24K are the best seats, window seats on the exit row. The blankets, pillows and headphones are the same as Business Class and you share the rear Business Class bathrooms.

When it comes to legacy airlines, especially those that have only just come back into black from near financial ruin, one doesn't expect much when travelling down the back in economy. In these circumstances it would be easy to say that my expectations were exceeded because I wasn't really expecting much. However, the overall quality of product and service goes far beyond this. I was booked on QF10 from LHR-DXB. It's a relatively short 7 hour flight and having travelled this route with both British Airways and Emirates I thought I knew what to expect. It was therefore a real pleasure to find a large, comfy pillow and lovely wide seat to relax in. The non-alcoholic welcome cocktail was a nice touch and there was a good selection of other drinks to choose from. I had been super intrigued to find out how the Qantas 'no tray' meal service works. In effect you do get one small tray on which sits the hot part of the meal. A pre-buttered hot roll is rested on top and the dessert comes in a separate disposable pot. It's an original and quirky idea which does work. However, I couldn't help but think that this deliberately allows Qantas to cut back on meal add ons like cheese and biscuits. Luckily the lamb curry and crumble dessert were of a decent size and tasty. The wine was of good quality and the post lunch hot drink offering was good. I wish I had gone for the hot chocolate and marshmallow option when I saw it was available but opted for the healthier peppermint tea. Throughout the rest of the flight the crew remained in the cabin offering water, juices and fresh fruit. The second snack meal was a tasty, heated pastry. One could help themselves to sweet granola bars from the galley during the flight. Cabin crew were professional and generally hospitable. The flight took off just a few minutes late despite a technical hitch in London and landed on time in Dubai. Luggage quickly arrived onto the carousel and I was out of the airport in next to no time. My second flight to Australia was with Emirates before rejoining Qantas in Perth to fly onto Brisbane and then a second flight up to Townsville. Check in at both PER and BNE was fully automated from seat selection to luggage tag printing and bag drop. Although this was efficient it did rather take away the human touch. The first flight to BNE was on an old 737 with little in the way of leg room and generally old, tired seats. Although there was no seatback IFE the plane was fitted with an audio/visual streaming service which was complimentary. There was a good choice of movies, TV shows and music. The second flight was just a short 2 hour hop. However, it was operated by a 737 with the new Boeing Sky interior, with seatback IFE. A dinner service was operated on this flight along with a chocolate Lindor to finish (a great touch). On both flights the crew were natural, warm and friendly. The new uniforms really stood out and showed off the crew in a good way. All in all a great experience with Qantas. I would highly recommend them after these flights.",False,A380 / Boeing 737,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to TSV via PER & BNE,September 2016,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",3,3,,True,2

We were sadly disappointed. A 14hr flight and only one meal. A couple of small snacks and drinks but only one meal. By the time the meal service reached us there was no choice. There was only Thai fish curry left - not a meal that appealed to either my husband or myself. The senior cabin steward did go to the business class and found a couple of pot pies which were very nice. Qantas seems to have dispensed with some of the nicer service touches such as wet wipes on the meal tray or warm towels for refreshing yourself after a meal. Compared to Emirates the entertainment system is very limited in content. We had attempted to obtain a business class upgrade on our flights to Europe using freqent flyer points.

They tried for an upgrade but this was unavailable. They next tried to pre select the seats but that was also unsuccessful. Instead they were given pre allocated seats that were 8 rows apart. There was no way we could alter this online so headed to the airport early. Sadly because this was a codeshare with Emirates (flying from Glasgow to Dubai with EK) we were told there add nothing we could do in Glasgow but I could phone Qantas ourselves. This we did and after a 20 minutes on the phone to a very helpful woman we were informed that the Qantas staff were in a break but when they were available she would sorry out the seating and get back to me. 45 minutes later and less than an hours before the parents had to go through security I called Qantas again. The person answering the phone could find no record of my previous call and more annoyingly could not alter the seating allocation for the parents but did say some one would get back to me in 48hours.

Not even any salt and pepper. That was it, one small plate. We were both still hungry so asked for the cheese platter, which consisted of two small pieces of cheese, two dried apricots and two crackers. Breakfast was equally skimpy. Instead of making rubbish such as cookies, ice creams and chocolate available during the flight (not that we saw them), the airline should concentrate on giving passengers proper meals.

"""like flying no-frills""",2,2016-07-15,"✅ Verified Review |  Melbourne to Hong Kong in Economy with Qantas. It turns out Economy with Qantas is just slightly better than being put in the hold with the baggage. For an airline that charges hefty prices this was like flying no-frills, or maybe worse because their tickets are super expensive. The economy seats were the narrowest seats I have ever seen in a plane certainly for a 10 hour flight. The seats were much narrower than the seats on any of the other airlines that we took on our trip to Europe. It was extremely uncomfortable. Qantas seems to keep to the minimum number of staff possible. As a result, the service was as minimal as the seats. It took them ages to provide drinks and meals. The staff were nice enough but Economy passengers barely saw much of them. Given the high cost of our economy tickets, it was insulting to be treated like some sort of after thought. The worst food ever in so many different ways. Usually on an airline we get a tray of food containing a hot meal, a salad, perhaps some cheese and crackers, maybe another snack and a dessert. On Qantas they gave us a hot meal and a dessert. There was no tray and there was no other food. Just a small sized hot meal and a dessert. That was it. As it happened the hot meal was just awful so we only had the dessert. Even the kids received a hot meal and an apple. In contrast, when our kids flew with Cathay they received a tray of food including a hot meal, juice, fruit, cupcake, snack, cheese. Our kids didn't like the hot meal and when we asked if they had something else, after ages waiting, a staff member brought some dry biscuits and another apple. There were a lot of apples on this Qantas flight but much not of anything else. We got off our Qantas flight absolutely starving hungry.

We booked our tickets to Rome with Qantas as the flights selected had a convenient midday departure with a two-hour stopover in Sydney, and three hours in Dubai. However, problems started before we left home. 1) Qantas cancelled our first flight and rescheduled a departure time three hours earlier. The new 9.00am departure created a five-hour first stopover in Sydney 2) Qantas then delayed the Sydney departure due to 'engineering requirements' by four hours. They kept extending the delay every 30 minutes, making it impossible to modify onward journey arrangements. The stopover had extended to nine hours from two. 3) This resulted in missing our connecting flight in Dubai. We were rebooked into a flight scheduled to depart more than five hours later. 4) My wife and I were assigned separated seats, as the flight was full. Further to this, the Qantas flight service was extremely tardy. They kept forgetting to bring my wife’s meal, which she received two hours after others had finished eating. The cabin was a constant mess as the cabin staff was extremely slow in removing trays, etc. 5) We arrived eight hours late in Rome and missed our connecting Alitalia flight.

"""overuse of the word mate """,4,2016-04-27,"✅ Verified Review |  Travelled with my husband and three children from Oslo to Melbourne on Emirates tickets, with the Dubai to Melbourne leg operated by Qantas. Stark contrast in quality of service, food and cabin fitout between Emirates and Qantas. Qantas staff seemed preoccupied with getting passengers to sleep as quickly as possible above all else, including requests for a bottle to get my tollder settled (grumpy, exhausted 3 year olds aren't conducive to getting a cabin full of people to sleep!). Kids weren't allowed to change seats before take off despite ample unoccupied seats after boarding was complete. Staff did however allow an adult male to change to an empty row of 4 seats before take off. On previous Emirates flights the kids seemed to be given at least a fair chance of occupying spare seats therefore increasing the possibility that they would sleep (which benefits the entire cabin). Kids meal on Qantas was a bread-like tube filled with veges and tomato sauce and a packet of Smarties. Contrast this with Emirates: hot bowl of macaroni cheese, rolls, a dessert, a drink, and a box full of snacks like small chocolate bars, crackers, crisps, and a small toothbrush kit. Entertainment system on Qantas was measly compared to Emirates with very few family movies and a smaller screen. Noticeably less leg room (my husband is 6 foot 4). In terms of service quality - only one staff member in our section seemed happy to be on the flight and conversed with our kids beyond 'Hi mate'. Qantas should be aware that (over)use of the word 'mate' doesn't make up for a lack of genuine care in making a kid's 13 hours in a confined space surrounded by snoring adults as comfortable as possible. On Emirates I felt totally comfortable asking for extra drinks, crisps etc for the kids (to reduce their loud 'I'm hungry' complaints). On Qantas I soon realised that these requests were treated as big extra workloads by the staff.

It was an overnight flight, and service was OK. The other problem with the flight was that Qantas ground staff in Sydney were not prepared for our arrival.

"""frankly disappointing""",4,2015-12-26,"A mediocre flight, and frankly disappointing. Living in Sydney, I fly Qantas regularly. On this occasion the crew was a let-down. The Qantas lounge in Hong Kong was superb - great ambience and had waiter-served 3-course Christmas menu. It was particularly appreciated, since I have a view of the chaos that was the boarding process at the gate downstairs. The boarding could be described, generously, as absolute shambles - disorderly and disorganised. It took at least 40 minutes for most passengers to board and 20 minutes after the gates supposed to be closed. On the flight, the service was incredibly slow, and the presence of the crew was sparse. I was seated at upper deck economy cabin, which was supposed to be quiet with ample attention from the cabin crew given the few seats. The opposite was the case on this flight. The economy cabin shares the galley with the Premium Economy cabin that is immediately in front. All trolley traffic, therefore, must first go past the economy. This proved to be very bothersome. The upper economy cabin is served by one trolley only; meal and drinks is served on one aisle, then the second aisle. If you have the misfortune of sitting on the left rear part of the cabin, too bad, you will have to wait a long time for your food even though there are only about 30 passengers in it! By the time the fellow at the left end of my row received his meal I had almost finished mine. To make matters worse, the crew was not particularly professional. It was made quite obvious to me and the rest of the passengers that the crew knew two of the passengers. One was possibly former cabin crew, and the other, possibly a very frequent flyer, whose name most of the cabin crew knew. These two passengers received extra drinks from the Premium Economy trolley, blankets and attention during the flight. These were all little gestures, and fair enough that airlines should show gratitude for loyalty. Yet, I daresay most passengers who managed to secure an upper deck seat are frequent flyers of some manner (the lady next to me was Qantas Platinum, and I had seen a few of the faces in the Qantas lounge). To have low presence and under-service the cabin while blatantly giving special treatment to passengers they knew was quite unprofessional - we also paid similar amounts for the same seats! To add insult to injury, while I was lining up at the Duty-Free at Sydney Airport I got shoulder-charged by one of the cabin crew as she left the counter, still in her uniform. No apology given.

During the meal service, my husband and I overheard an exchange between a dissatisfied customer and staff - all handled promptly and with professionalism in our opinion. The flight to Tokyo was a little bit different. Having high expectations after excellent domestic service, I was dismayed to see a dated aircraft that unfortunately was not properly cleaned from the flight before. The crew were more subdued and lacking enthusiasm and it was back to the usual stodge for the meals.

Being handed a bottle of water while the crew was looking and talking to someone else (I found this particularly rude). It was just about shoved in my face. Not having my meal order being taken while the person directly beside me did, and then being told by the crew ""oh your order isn't on the list I assumed you weren't eating, let me see what I can do"" as if she was doing me a favour! These are all small insignificant things, but when you drop $7K+ on a flight you expect better. The seat is comfortable enough, although I note Qantas has a 2-2-2 config versus Emirates 1-2-1. The interior of drab cabin colours aren't particularly appealing either for a 22 hours of flying. No WiFI (which I can live without, yet other airlines have it). Inflight entertainment was satisfactory, but Qantas policy doesn't allow you to bring out the screen until you are in the air.

No active QF communication as they got my email and mobile number or why on earth did they not delay my flight to Dubai for 10 hours. Later I found out passengers booked under EK flight numbers were reshuffled to other EK connecting flights, passengers under Qantas had to see the QF counter in Dubai (see below). Flight service was extremely poor from FRA to Dubai, took 3 hrs to finish service, whole seat rows were forgotten to service and they could not fix this for 20 minutes (usually they do this instantly). Drinks were not delivered with the meal but well after, EK service has gone dramatically downhill. On arrival in Dubai plane was parked on roll field and we had the longest air field tour ever. It took 20 minutes in a barely air-conditioned bus with 38 degree outside temperature to arrive. Once the building was reached a big queue on incoming security check. Some passengers on tight connections got very nervous and I doubt they made it. Trying to find a QF counter at Dubai airport was a nightmare as the maze at this airport is indeed amazing. It took me 45 to get to the right concourse after 4 stops at info counters as no relevant signs exist. Some people told me it took them 2 hrs to get there from touchdown. Another 15 minutes to find the right exit and shuttle stop, just missed a shuttle to the express hotel - next one was only 30 minutes later. So from touchdown to arriving at the hotel nearby took 2.5-3 hrs and I walked about just short of 2km including all the extra steps trying to find the counter way. After 6 hrs or so I tried to make my way to the shuttle but long queue and not enough seats and full so had to push the hotel to organise quicker returns as a few groups were waiting also. At the same time the flight was pulled forward some 40 minutes so for those relying on the boarding pass time printed on the boarding pass was very tight, although it did not matter as another delay. Service on the Dubai–Sydney sector was good apart from the annoying new approach to service where everything is given separately, i.e. cutlery one pass, tablet, main meal, desert and drinks – wonder who came up with that stupid idea? This whole experience was quite amazing and makes you realise how tricky things can get and thinking about passengers who are not able to easily walk about 2 kms or do not speak English well enough to follow the maze of instructions to even get to a Qantas counter – they would have had no chance and it makes you realise how easy a connecting flight through e.g. Singapore on the same airline is.",False,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Sydney via Dubai,July 2015,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",1,2,,False,

As Qantas is the only one offering direct flights to Shanghai (code share with China Eastern) there's no other choices for time poor travellers.

Man next to me made his bed flat and strapped himself in clearly not wanting to be disturbed. I sat watching the rather small screen entertainment and closed my eyes occasionally. Was I asked if I wanted a meal? No. When I realised I had missed food I was told service had finished so had a whisky instead. Business Class? We weren't able to land in Dubai so circled for a long time before diverting to Bahrain to refuel. Waited there and flew back. This added over four hours to flying time. I was given one can of ginger beer in that time (and that was offered with a scowl). The seats were all right but nothing special. The service was diabolical. In many years of flying all across the world this cabin crew was one of the worst I have encountered and did nothing for the reputation of Qantas.

Nobody onboard actually complained about the lengthy delays. However I soon discovered I was on an older B747 aircraft the entertainment system was difficult to use onboard as it wasn't a touchscreen and it crashed often. The whole design of the interface also resembled an old computer operating system from the 1980s-90s. There was also not a lot of choice of movies compared to the QF A380.

There is always a choice of mains - had a very nice soy chicken dish with vegetable fried rice.

This offers every other seat right up against the window with the storage on the aisle side and the other seats the opposite where they sit against the aisle (with the potential to be bumped) with the storage against the window. If you are a window viewer make sure you pick the right seat configuration. The crew were great but the lunch meal was below Qantas standard. I had fish and it was dry and tasteless.

Qantas Airways customer review,9,2015-05-12,I flew Qantas QF27/28 in economy to and from Santiago on the 8 October 2014 and 5 January 2015 respectively. The QF27 leg to SCL was fantastic. At the counter my oversize baggage was checked in without issue. The food was great and it seemed like every hour or so crew were coming around with desserts ice creams or drinks. The crew dealt with a drunk unruly passenger seated in front of me in an assertive way and the CSM disarmed the situation. The staff seemed to strike that balance of being friendly and getting on with the job in an efficient manner. As we approached Santiago from the south the Andes came into view on the right - definitely choose the right side of the plane if flying QF27! This would have to be one of the most scenic long-haul flights in the world and certainly gave an adventurous feel to the beginning of my 3-month holiday. Coming back the other way on QF28 I again had awesome views of the Andes from the left-side of the plane as we tracked very far south over Chile's Patagonian archipelago. One negative I would highlight is the price. The fare to South America is generally expensive so it's worthwhile waiting for a sale. I paid $2350 return but have a sale fare booked next year for $1600 in Jan/Apr. It helps if you travel a few weeks either side of Christmas. Staying on cost Qantas charges for seat selection. For me it's window seat or nothing so I didn't mind coughing up $25 each way but its worth noting that competitor LAN offers free seat selection. Lastly the entertainment selection is good but the provided headphones only provided sound through one ear. Combined with the roar of the 747's engines at the back of the plane I couldn't really settle into a movie as I was straining to hear the audio. I flew LAN's 787 within South America and the quietness of that aircraft made watching movies much easier. Something to consider now that LAN flies the 787 on the SYD-AKL-SCL route. On the flip-side its comforting to know you're on the tried and tested four-holer 747 as you cross the deserted Southern Ocean (and you don't need to make the stop at AKL making for a quicker flight).,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,3,,True,

No child meal despite request one warm meal 11 hours after boarding before only snags and one pizza slice. No trace of the crew occasionally they pass through.
