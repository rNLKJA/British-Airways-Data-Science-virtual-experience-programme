Not sure when it was cancelled, but it was after we had checked in earlier in the day. Because we were in Seattle the customer service desk was already shut down for the day so we had to wait until the next morning to get help. The customer service rep was very kind and helpful (the only reason to give an average customer service rating). She confirmed the cancellation was due to crew issues. The next available flight for our family was in 7 days which is obviously not a valid option. She did offer a full refund and we have received that. But we had to rebook 5 new tickets for the next day which also added another hotel night and rental car day. It cost us an additional $2500. The flight experience may be perfectly fine, and I do believe the rep did everything she was allowed to do. But if you are booking with them be fully aware you could be stranded or incur a significant expense if your flight is cancelled and they aren't able to offer a timely replacement.

It took over 24-hours to discover that my bag was put on the wrong flight and ended up in Orlando. They refused to collaborate with any other airlines to get it flown to Vancouver in a timely manner and insisted that Saturday would be the earliest they could send it on the next Sun Country flight (although I arrived on Wednesday so that’s looking at 4 days without my bag although they knew were it was). I had to provide my contact information 4 times to 4 different customer service agents - it seemed like they had absolutely no tracking system for information and/or baggage. After spending hours on the phone during my vacation and being assured several times that my bag would be delivered to me once it arrived on Saturday, it finally arrived on Saturday and I was informed that Sun Country doesn’t have agreements in place with any of the delivery carriers at the Vancouver airport so they could not in fact deliver it to me. I spent another 2+ hours to travel to the airport to pick it up, where I was met with empty Sun Country desks and an airport information desk employee who insisted there was nothing he could do to help although my bag was at that very same airport.

Then, I get an email saying like ""we're really sorry, so as a sign of our commitment to excellent customer service, we've refunded you your original ticket price."" This almost feels insulting, that the only remuneration offered is the money for the flight I never got to set foot on due to a malfunctioning or error on Sun Country's part. I call again - maybe 3-4 times because their customer service is impossible to reach. The agent tells me she'll look into it. I get an email a few days later saying ""Sorry, we're not going to do anything."" They don't care about their customers. They don't care about their commitments or flight schedules. They are definitely not a well-functioning airline, and they are hardly a business at all run based on a modicum of common sense.

After my experience with this company I felt it was important to leave a review for those like me that have severe flying anxiety. My first interaction with this company after booking happened when I noticed that I failed to put middle names on my booking so our boarding passes would not match our passports. I called the service number and left my call back number. I had already read that no one answers the phone so I was prepared to be disappointed by not receiving a call back. A couple of hours later a young lady called me back and I explained my mistake. Her response was ""Well let's get that corrected so you can be at ease have a great trip."" She corrected 4 middle names on my booking and emailed me a new itinerary while staying on the phone with me to make sure everything looked ok. Disaster averted. We then got to the airport on Sunday to find out our flight was delayed. Again, after reading the horror stories of delayed flights being cancelled and people being left to fend for themselves I began to feel very high anxiety. One of my adult children would be flying from a different airport but same airline into Mexico and I was afraid she'd be in Mexico by herself. The flight was an hour late but finally showed up, they very calmly unloaded the passengers coming into Houston and got us all on the plane as quickly and well organized as I've ever seen. The flight attendants personally apologized to the passengers as we boarded for being late explaining that there were severe storms at their last stop and that they had to wait it out. I don't even know where to begin about our experience with our flight home. From Mexico, coming back into America, you must check in at the counter to show your negative covid test. Of all the check in counters, it was the shortest line, the staff was friendly and very patient with everyone, and they went above and beyond to help us get checked in and to our terminal in time. Wonderful service. I have flown on several airlines and take several trips a year and this is probably one of the best experiences I have had flying (that included set backs). There's a lot of bashing this airline for things that anyone could avoid just by doing their research or reading their booking information. The seating is no different than other airlines. The drinks come with a cup of ice just like every other airline. Oh there's phone chargers on the backs of the seat legs which I have never seen before. That was cool. We got free WiFi.

Neither my partner nor myself have ever experience the level of incompetence and sheer unprofessionalism from an airline as we did this Saturday (6/29) until our first and only encounter with Sun Country Airlines. The short of it is that our flight to Minnesota was cancelled without ever informing us even now 48hrs after the scheduled flight. We were booked for an 11:45am flight out of Newark, NJ non-stop to Minneapolis, MN, flight SY 234. We received an email at 5am saying our flight had been delayed to 2:45pm, no biggie. At 8am another email arrived with an update that the delay was now until 3:10pm, no prob. Around 8:45am (AFTER the two delay emails) another airline’s plane made an emergency landing at Newark Airport causing complete closure for about 3hrs. Understandably all the airlines spent the rest of the day scrambling to accommodate their passengers, all but Sun Country Airlines. We had left our apt around 8:45am before opening the emails regarding the delays but decided we might as well continue over to the airport just in case things change further. We arrived around 11am and noticed immediately that the departure board had been updated and now our flight had been delayed until 4:46pm although we hadn’t received any email notification. Arriving at the ticket counter we discovered the Sun Country counter was closed and no employees were to be found. Several families were stranded with us and all stated without discrepancy that we had just missed two Sun Country employees being instructed by their supervisor to close their ticket counter and leave! No explanation to their customers, no assistance, and no update that the flights had been cancelled! One of the other customers informed us of the cancellation and gave us a Sun Country customer service number, apparently a parting gift from the Sun Country ticket counter employees. He warned us that he’d been on the phone for more than 45min thus far without getting through to anyone. My partner immediately placed the call. Upon noting how many people around us were discussing booking on another flight we scrambled our financial resources and bought the cheapest available tickets on another carrier that would get us to our destination, spending $500 more than the previous tickets had been. Finally, over 2hrs later, my partner was able to reach someone representing Sun Country customer service on the phone. This rep voiced shock and surprise when he explained to her that the Sun Country supervisor had pulled his ticket counter employees without any explanation to their customers, that we had not received any notice of cancellation (she confirmed the cancellation), and that we’d been on hold for over 2hrs still at the airport. She refused to send us any emailed confirmation of the cancelation nor the promised full refund. Fast forward two days later, we still have not received any notification from Sun Country of the cancellation, there’s no listing of the flight cancellation online, no notification of a refund, and of course no actual refund.

It is not really a surprise, although it is terribly disappointing, that Sun Country is turning out to be another Allegiant - or worse - and soon to be worse than Spirit. It takes a lot of bad decisions and questionable practices to make that happen. Sun Country used to differentiate itself in the market - sensible pricing and customer-friendly - a great middle of the road winning strategy when implemented properly. Unfortunately, the customer-friendly aspect at Sun Country is history. They truly do not care about their customers. They do care about their customers' money - and they implement every trick in the book to extract more of it from them. And, it keeps getting worse. Part of Sun Country's problem is that they no longer have any leadership positions. They are followers of the industry it total and of the industry's most hated companies. When I buy an airline ticket, I expect to be provided a seat. Paying twice for seats has become an unsavory practice of some carriers, Sun Country included. But Sun Country goes even further. They intentionally punish their customers who refuse to pay extra for their seat. Now, you cannot check in online if you refuse to pay extra to choose a seat. Spirit does the same thing (Shame!) but at least they let you check in at a kiosk at the airport. On our 1/1/2019 Sun Country flight, they provided no kiosk at the airport, so we had to stand in line (30 minutes) to check in - even though we had no luggage. That punishment is obviously so people will pay the seat extortion in the future. Today I had the misfortune of making a mistake in the booking of a Sun Country ticket for my grandaughter. Easy to correct on customer- friendly airlines. But, Sun Country had no way to cancel the ticket online. You had to call Reservations. I did, and was told the wait might be up to 60 minutes. Actually, the wait was a little over one hour. I had to rebook her flight, but I gladly paid more on another carrier so I could avoid further abuse from Sun Country. I was not abused as badly as all those people who were stranded when Sun Country cancelled scores of flights - and then said they would refund the fares, but the people ""were on their own"". That kind of arrogance and contempt for customers is what will eventually bring Sun Country down. Maybe not too late to fix it, but all indications are that it is going the other way. Sad. Too bad.

No in-flight entertainment unless you want to pay for it and this is being removed from their planes (my Sun country flight to Cancun did not have it) and they are saddled with some poor management decisions. The planes are older and usually somewhat dirty as they usually have under 15 minutes to turn them around and the ground staff is usually not knowledgeable because the current ownership is contracting for their Gate Agent and counter staff at a competing salary with McDonald's, so they are not the best.

The first time they at least noticed and set it aside in the baggage claim, so that I didn't risk anything falling out and being lost. The second time, however, this was not the case and it came rolling down the baggage claim with it's huge rip, and the entire bottom half of the suitcase fell out when I picked it up. 3 of my flights have been delayed over a half-hour, not due to weather, but due to poor planning of arrivals and other take offs (once according to the captain himself). My worst experience, however, was when my flight was delayed over 2 hours, causing me and 9 other passengers to miss our connecting flight, a flight we all originally had plenty of time to get to without even changing terminals. Sun Country didn't land where it said it would on all of our tickets, and put us in a completely separate terminal with only 5 minutes to de-board the plane, hop on a tram, and get to the next terminal. When we as a group asked what Sun Country could do to help us still get to our final destination, as most of us had rides waiting for us there and it was late at night, they replied there was nothing they could do and there would be no refund for our missed flights because it ""wasn't their fault because of the weather,"" yet other people I knew who flew out the same day from other airlines in the same airport with the same weather conditions made it out on time. For this, I would rate them 1 star for customer service and 1 star for ability of their crew/equipment and the quality of their planes. I have not experienced much better in-flight quality either. Their flights are usually crowded compared to any other major or smaller/local airlines I have flown in. The seats themselves are okay, fairly comfortable, but with no adjustable headrest like most airplanes have now, and with a somewhat difficult seat recliner. The quarters are cramped: smaller than usual aisles and much closer together seats with little legroom. There is also no in-flight entertainment, which is fine by me, but I know many other airlines offer this now. The free drinks are fine, but there's no in-flight free food, and I've had several somewhat grumpy stewards/stewardesses (it's probably not their fault though - these are very uncomfortable conditions to work in, and I'm sure they get many unhappy passengers because of the conditions as well). I would say you get what you pay for, but I've flown Delta for relatively the same price and Spirit for much less, and both were a much superior experience.

What impressed me was the number of check in counters that were opened when flying from MSP to SFO. They had 15 counters all manned. Lady at check in counter was very friendly. Got us through in no time. Flight attendants were wonderful. Made sure we had our drinks and comfortable.

Sun Country Airlines customer review,,2014-01-04,I flew from Seattle to Minneapolis to Chicago Midway this past December. All flights were late no announcements were made until 15 minutes before departure time. Leaving Midway we were told 15 minutes before the flight that they were waiting for the plane to land. 5 minutes later they told us that after circling the airport for 45 minutes the plane was turned away by Air Traffic Control due to bad weather. We were forced to stay another night in Chicago at our own expense. While we were waiting in line to get re-booked for the next flight Frontier landed and disembarked at the gate next to us.

Sun Country Airlines customer review,5,2013-10-01,The trip from Boston to Las Vegas went without incident though I thought we would never stop driving around the runway. It took us 15 minutes to get to the runway to take off. The same thing happens when you land. Coming into Boston it took forever to get in position to land. The seats are horribly uncomfortable - no padding at all. The crew were attentive and nice.

Sun Country Airlines customer review,5,2013-08-26,MSP to LAS and the trip out was just fine. Good staff and pilot with no problems. The flight back was just a pain. Leaving Las Vegas we were not informed until we got to the tarmac we were number 25 of 30 planes in line to depart. The Captain said we would be in the air shortly. One hour later we took off. We then had an in flight emergency which the staff did very well with but the captain said nothing to anyone. We just had the fasten seatbelt the whole flight.

Sun Country Airlines customer review,1,2013-08-22,Sun Country is the worst nickel and dime airline I've flown in a long time. They charge you for every single bag. Now they won't even allow you to check-in ahead of time at all unless you agree to pay for each seat assignment. Plus they charge more to pay your bag fee at the airport. If you don't pay the fee for a seat assignment you can't purchase the discounted bag fee online. I'd rather pay a little more up front for a respectable airline than get hit with all these petty hidden fees on a ticket that was a little cheaper in the first place.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,,False
Sun Country Airlines customer review,5,2013-08-01,Wed July 31. Asked for aisle or window. Specifically asked if seat reclined as I was not feeling well. It did not and I could only be moved to middle seat after paying extra $25.00! Not very nice!,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,3,,,True
Sun Country Airlines customer review,10,2013-05-29,Not the cheapest fare for JFK-MSP-SFO but an interesting alternative the usual mainliners. Checked in online and took advantage of an upgrade to (domestic) first class for $290 mostly because I had to get into SF fast and thought this would make it easier to carry my large suitcase as hand luggage which worked fine although in practise it was a tiny bit too large to fit in the overhead locker but the kind flight attendant was able to stow it in a galley compartment which was helpful. Service inflight was charm personified and was served a very nice open sandwich on a tray with metal cutlery - better than domestic F class on other US carriers. Flights were obviously timed to connect in Minneapolis so 90 mins in the low-cost terminal was painless with excellent view of the busy air traffic out on the runways. Second leg MSP-SFO even more generous food this time a hot meal full of flavour. Slightly different configurations first 737-700 had no divider between F and Y second 737-700 had divider but different seats actually it was an ex-easyJet aircraft and still had the easyJet seat fabric which was a nice reminder of home. Landed on time (1705) and was off the plane quickly and thus made my appointment in the city at 1800 with time to spare (1750). Will definitely fly this charming airline again.,False,,,First Class,,,4,5,,,4,,,True

On my latest flight to San Diego from MSP everything went very smoothly. The staff are very attentive and accommodating.

Sun Country Airlines customer review,9,2013-03-01,"Round trip from Minneapolis to Puerto Vallarta in February. I had no problems at all. Both flights left on time and arrived early. The crew southbound was friendlier than the one on my return but both were professional. An airline representative did test my carry-on for size by placing it in the ""your bag must fit comfortably in this"" contraption in PV. After I removed a large novel from an outer pocket it fit comfortably and I did not pay anything additional. I frequently see Sun Country employees look the other way when passengers carry on bags that are far larger than the regulations allow. My hunch is that those same passengers skate the rules so often it feels unfair when someone actually measures their bags.

Sun Country Airlines customer review,,2012-06-12,We were caught in the Sun Country's baggage extortion this last week. We sat with everyone for over an hour waiting for the gate to open. The gate personnel stood there with nothing to do. When they started boarding they seemingly randomly stopped people to measure their bag. Surprise almost none of the bags fit in the bin. Everyone whose bag was measured stated it was a bag that had fit on several flights. Our bag had been on over 20 flights including the flight into Minneapolis. There was no time to deal with it since we were already boarding. At our destination I counted 31 carryon bags in the carousel. I measured the overhead and closed it was 4 inches bigger than the measuring bin. Each bag at the gate was $25 each.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Sun Country Airlines customer review,,2012-05-18,"Flew once with them to DC had 1.5 hrs wait on a runway in Lansing which was hot muggy and enormously uncomfortable. Not so much as an ""I'm sorry"". 3 weeks later I flew again to Phoenix and I'm hit with a startling $100 in baggage fees because my 14-inch carry-on I took just 20 days earlier are no longer considered carry-ons by Sun Country. I was charged $30 for requesting 2 of my seat assignments online. Then another $80 to get my family's carry-ons back home again! I saved myself $20 by prepaying for my carry-ons online. I did not request seats online. If I had that would have been yet another $10 or $15 per seat depending on what I chose. $210 later. If my air fare had been really cheap I could perhaps justify some of these fees but my tickets were nothing special. I felt completely gouged on top of really mediocre service.

Sun Country Airlines customer review,3,2011-10-14,If you want something cheap and don't mind having constant delays or+ not being informed about them until the last minute then Sun Country is the airline for you! I've had several flights with them and it's been delayed countless of times. I fly enough to know that delays are inevitable and I do not blame them for this. However the problem is the lack of communication in their part to inform passengers about these delays. With any other airline if there is a delay all I have to do is wait a bit later in my home or office before heading out to the airport. But do not expect the same from them. Passengers find out about about these delays 30 minutes before the flight is supposed to board. The reason I am writing this unfavorable review is because every time the plane had never left Atlanta and/or another location that is literally 3-4 hours away. That means that while the plane has been sitting somewhere for 2 hours we are told about it 1 hour later and according to them it is only delayed for an hour - which I'll find out later on when they announce another flight delay. I will be paying a couple bucks more from now on to fly with a more professional airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,False

Sun Country Airlines customer review,10,2011-07-31,Just did the return London-Minneapolis/St.Paul flight. Excellent on the ground and in air service on both the outbound and return leg. Technical stop in Gander both directions was excellent-no need to take passport/boarding card - it's simply in and out or you can stay on board if you prefer. Gander had a duty free/gift store and a cafe open for us arriving there's also a smoker's lounge if you need it. Hot meal and light meal service were excellent and free. The rentable digiEplayer service excellent and good value for the $6 you pay. Plenty of legroom and comfortable. The flight attendants were exceptional and very attentive. My reservations about crossing the Atlantic on a B737 are gone. Ground staff did not charge me for an aisle seat or my luggage being slightly over limit either.

Sun Country Airlines customer review,9,2011-07-17,SEA-BOS round-trip flight one stop in MSP both times. I was seated in a 737-800 with no seat changes. The crew came around 5-6 times on the flight from MSP-SEA when it was only a 5hr flight. On every trip the plane was early to arrive by 10-15 mins. I was very impressed that every plane was on time for take off and arrival. Many people complain about the $25 checking fee for bags and I have to say that every airline has a checking fee whether hidden in the ticket price or not. I was very glad that Sun Country is a smaller airline because the flights weren't incredibly crowded. I witnessed a heavier man asking for a seat change due to increase his comfort and the attendants gladly moved him to a different seat on the plane. On my flight from BOS-MSP there was an incident where they double booked 2 seats but otherwise it was pretty smooth.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Sun Country Airlines customer review,,2011-05-21,Minneapolis to Las Vegas. When checking in on-line be aware of the fees tacked on if you want to sit next to your spouse or traveling companion. You can possibly avoid this if you go to the ticketing booth. Boarding procedure at Minneapolis is time consuming. After calling for first class medical family and no carry on the rest of the plane boards similar to cattle being driven into a chute. Las Vegas boards their planes back to front (first-class medical family and no carry - on go first in that order) and because of this procedure we enjoyed 15 minutes ahead of published flight time. The staff were fantastic. Excellent service is what sets this airline apart from all the other airlines in Minneapolis. This company has sadly fallen in line with other airlines with regards to pricing and to the bottom line of running an airline.

Sun Country Airlines customer review,1,2010-07-28,LAX to Minneapolis. This is my first time of flying Sun Country. My daughter and I had a connecting flight. From Manila to LAX we flew Philippines Airlines and from LAX to MSP Sun Country. I was charged $25.00 for each of my checked in baggage. I never had to do this with other airlines. I have fllown NW American Delta etc. for my connecting flight and did not have to pay for my checked in baggage. I explained to the Customer Service Rep that this is my connecting flight but she insisted that I still have to pay because the plane I took for my international flight was not Sun Country. No matter how I explained it I still paid for all my checked in baggage. To make matter worse my daughter and I were separated when they assigned seats. I asked that we sit together because she is a minor but I was told by the CSR they can't do that for me and that I just have to wait to see if there are people who would be willing to switch once we get in the plane. No one was willing so my daughter and I were apart. I did not like the CSR. As I was trying to explain the situation she was smirking and it was very insulting. My daughter mentioned this to me later that she also noticed it. Very rude. I hope I don't have to fly Sun Country again.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Sun Country Airlines customer review,2,2009-12-04,While attempting to check in the night before departure we learned that the airline sometime earlier had canceled our non-stop flight and switched us to a stop-over flight that left 45 minutes earlier (requiring a much earlier wake up) and was an hour and a half longer. We got no email advising us of this change. Traveling with small children the change made for an significant inconvenience. Had we known we would have purchased non-stop tickets with a different airline for the same price. The airline offered to send us vouchers for $50 in travel at a later date but that assumes we would fly with them again. Very disappointed.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False

Fortunately I have family to spend time with away from the airport - some passengers were at the airport 14 hours! I initially arrived at the airport at 6 AM to check my luggage and then returned again 4 hours before actual departure - because it wasn't certain when the plane would arrive from MPLS to unload/reload. What made the passengers most angry and frustrated was the fact there were no SunCountry agents at the desk. The delays were not posted on the electronic posting so no one had a clue what was going on.

Sun Country is one of the best when it comes to the budget airlines much better then Ted or Air Tran and the service was very friendly.

Sun Country Airlines customer review,,2005-04-22,Booked a Sun Country flight for child 13 years of age - which carries an additional charge of $100 ($50 each way) for an unaccompanied minor. Lots of paperwork! List who is picking her up -- they must have a photo ID --- and so on. Flying daughter from Orlando to Minneapolis ... into and out of the Hubert Humphrey terminal. Return flight - was not satisfactory -- and Sun Country does not have signed paper - and daughter notes that no one helped her find seat no one helped with carry on - and they left her to find her way off of the plane - and to her father -- who saw no one in attendance - and Sun Country does not have anything signed saying the designated person picked her up. So why the charge? Thank goodness it was a direct flight - and who monitors these things. What is the airlines responsibility regarding unaccompanied minors? The job was right on the flight out -- but they really blew it on the return flight ... forget about luggage and carry ons -- this was the most precious cargo they had on the plane (to me). Did they fumble the ball? No - worse they didn't even know where the game was being played. And evidently couldn't find the ball if it was sitting right in front of them. Shame on Sun Country.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Sun Country Airlines customer review,,2005-04-20,My wife and I flew to Cancun from MSP on April 10th and returned on April 15th 2005. Flight was on time going to and was 20 minutes late on the return trip only because of the back-up in Cancun. This was the first flight for my wife on a commercial arline and I personally do not like to fly but Sun Country changed our views on flying. Staff was very professional and had a smile for you without even trying. My wife really enjoyed her first flight I still do not like to fly but when we take our next vacation guess what Sun Country will be the first choice. We were totally impressed with you! Thank you for helping make our vacation a most memorable one!! Keep up the great effort!,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Sun Country Airlines customer review,,2005-02-01,I have enjoyed flying Sun Country each time I have flown to Minneapolis.! Flight times are good and rarely delayed service great and the sandwich is a nice touch! I recommend Sun Country highly and only wish they had more flights. Due to the low cost I can travel to visit my grandchildren more often whenever I have a 3 day weekend!,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Sun Country Airlines customer review,,2005-01-20,I would like to share our opinion on Suncountry's methods of changing flight times. We had booked a flight in early in Sept for travel in Jan from MPS to Cozumel. Times were great - then they changed it on Nov 5 - and now they changed it again. We arrive in Cozumel much later Saturday so we feel SunCountry has cheated us out of 1 vacation day. Also we leave very late the following Saturday. Check out is 12pm and our fight leaves at 8pm so this means we will have pay for 1/2 day stay at the hotel and we will not get into MPS till 1230am Sunday. I don't not think that this is a fair system. We agreed on the time and it worked for our schedules now Suncountry ahs messed things up!! We have never had this happen before!!,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Sun Country Airlines customer review,,2004-11-23,SFO-MSP-SFO Nov. 18-24. Once again I was pleasantly surprised by the flights. The crews were friendly personable and interested in interaction with passengers. The flight to MSP was on a Transavia 737 with seating pitch designed by Atilla the Hun but I had 3 seats so was able to stretch sideways. I continue to be favorably impressed - especially given the fare.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Sun Country Airlines customer review,,2004-10-19,MSP-SFO. Flight worked perfectly with schedule requirements and was only $100 as opposed to much more on NW. MSP signage for Humphrey Terminal leaves something to be desired but the overall flight experience was equal to any on a legacy carrier but perhaps with a better attitude. This was my third flight with Sun Country and I have no complaints.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
