"""avoid Loganair like the plague""",2,2022-09-10,Not Verified |  A word of warning - avoid Loganair like the plague. More of a joke than an airline really. I lost a day of my trip when my outbound flight was cancelled. My inbound flight was delayed by 2.5 hours so I missed my onward flight last night. Next flight to Norwich is on Sunday so they wanted to put me in a hotel for two days. When I booked a flight for the next day on another airline and asked them to cancel my flight they then washed their hands of me and I had to sort my own hotel last night. This morning I arrived at the airport at 5.30am. Loganair have 5 flights on the departure board - 3 of those are already delayed by an hour or more.

"""like to express huge gratitude""",10,2021-12-29,"I am writing a separate review for this return trip, because I would like to express huge gratitude to the Loganair ground staff at Kirkwall. Never felt so silly in my flying ‘career’, but I managed to book a return flight for a wrong date, and found this out only at the check-in counter. What I would like to outline is not the fact that I was eventually rebooked on an earlier flight (had a FlexPlus fare so it was assumed), but how the staff cared. The initial morning flight had to be delayed and aircraft promptly replaced for a smaller one due to crew sickness: the ground staff had to manage 80+ passengers, most of whom went on vacation with families and were missing their flight connections: they resolved the situation very efficiently (I assume it is not easy to find alternative flights when flying out from a small island in the middle of nowhere known for an awful weather) and remained kind during the process. And in the middle of this all, the check-in manager found me out from the crowd in the departure hall and personally presented me with a new boarding pass, thus, solving my own mess in addition to the problems they had on the plate.

Lovely ground experience (my bag was too big to be brought inside the cabin and the manager just kindly offered to place it in the cargo hold), excellent flight crew and lovely service (delicious cookies, cold and hot beverages). Seats were comfortable for a turbo-prop and what I also liked very much was that the ATR-72 was not as noisy as, say, Dash-8.

On the date of me writing this review, the flight is supposed to be leaving but upon checking the flight status I have found out that they moved our flight to the following day without informing us. Turns out because someone had phoned my partner to confirm the return cancellation, they left a note on the system saying that they had already contacted us so they never informed us of the change in date for the flight there.

"""No alcohol is permitted""",8,2020-02-13,"A good commuter service serving Derry in Northern Ireland to Southend. This recently changed from Stansted on this route but there is a minimal time difference on reaching central London by train or car. The airline has the benefit of an included service to allow you an optional free airport check in, advance seat allocation and an included baggage allowance. Pre-booking a seat, you may have reassigned due to the number of passengers and pay-load. The check in staff and cabin crew are all friendly and professional. There is a basic beverage service on board accompanied by a biscuit/snack. I asked for some water and was presented with a small cup with a peel off lid. This is rarely offered by most airlines and is a good positive for the airline. Perhaps a complimentary newspaper could be an addition at the gate! But overall the seats are good flights are good and the interior well maintained. I signed up for the Clan Loganair loyalty programme and was sent a Hogmanay voucher over the New Year period. Having booked several flights with them I was disappointed they did not honour the voucher when I tried to redeem it. I wrote a letter of complaint and they explained they would not honour this one off voucher. They accepted it was valid and in date but would not process this as the booking was already made. I have though booked other flights with them since as the airline crew make up for the poor commitment and response I received from the marketing and customer service team.

Loganair operates out of Glasgow airport to this remote location several times a day. The Saab 340 has 34 seats and has two propellers. The seat was comfortable. The plane was only half full. The flight attendant moved passengers around the the cabin to ensure ""balance"". It felt quaint and reminded me of the many Saab 340 flights I had taken from Detroit to Marquette (MQT) on Northwest Airlines (before Delta once it acquired Northwest retired them and replaced with CRJs). The actual flight time was less than 30 minutes and the views of the country side, the indented coastlines, and the landing over the waters were a pleasure to behold. The sole flight attendant ensured that safety rules were communicated and followed. She was dressed in the red and black tartan uniform, the colors of this Scotland based airliner. No food or drink service on this wee plane on this short flight. Given the limited space in the cabin, even carry on bags, had to be checked in. No charge. Check in at the Glasgow and Islay airports (for the return) were smooth and went off without a glitch. The alternate to the flights would have been a very long and ardous car/bus drive followed by a ferry crossing lasting for another at least over a couple of hours.
