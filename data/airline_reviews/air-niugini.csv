"""lack of alcoholic beverages is sub-par""",7,2022-03-23,"Flew Wapanamanda-Port Moresby-Singapore on 20-21 March 2022. The domestic leg was on an old Dash8-200 aircraft always used on this route. It became the noisiest flight I have had for many years. Service on board given (juices and biscuits). Half load. Free seating. Allowed to check in 30 hours in advance. Flight delayed 25 Minutes which is bearable. Smooth check-in, and very fast luggage delivery in Moresby. The international leg was eased by the airline’s Helpdesk who advised promptly on corona and other documents requirements/changes to avoid any check-in panic or denial. Check-In took long time due to loads of document checks. 3 counters open was hardly enough for the only 60+ passengers, e.g. it took me alone 25 minutes to get a BP issued. Lack of a full alliance with e.g. Oneworld, complicates things – Qatar, who issued my ticket, including for onward flights, is only a partner. Lounge access in POM were generously given to all the airlines’ frequent flyers. Their lounge was good in terms of hot foods offering, view, and space (we were only 5 visitors to fill 145 chair-spaces). Drink offering were shockingly poor; absolutely no alcoholic beverages beyond milk and sodas - and the coffee was burnt to the level to call the fire brigade. The actual flight was on an aged, noisy, but well refurbished B767-300. Flight punctual and even early in both ends. FAs were kind and informative. The complete lack of alcoholic beverages is completely sub-par: it was apologized by FAs and said to be temporarily and change back by April 2022 to be re-instated. Only 1 meal service on a 6 hours’ afternoon flight is scarce. Food offerings were 2 options, beef and chicken – that complemented the offerings from Paradise lounge well where we had fish, fish-balls, lamb, and cheeses. No WiFi nor IFE onboard – but flight monitors at every seat made us know the name of all Indonesian islands passed. Power outlets provided at every seat.

Old aircrafts, both of >25 years of age but well taped together. Ground service and Helpdesk excellent, prompt and cooperative. At a certain stage the airline allowed me to keep the domestic ticket open as they realised the numerous changes: I had to change ticket 4 times due to strict and changing travel/entering regulations to PNG - all worsened by Corona and transit variations (first 2 legs from CPH via DOH to SIN) in Singapore including “transit clearances”, immigration’s approval, tests, visa, criminal record certificate, vaccinations, etc. What happened to all the fun in the World? Gate pass and Check-Ins were easy in SIN as well in POM. The airlines’ cooperation with Qatar Airways is smooth and ease procedures as reduce ticket price. Moreover, their Oneworld Cooperation granted me free access to Qantas Business Lounge in Singapore which was a great relief and a pleasure of some luxury. The first flight was a night flight and a fully acceptable hot dinner was served. Could stretch out and sleep even in the very noisy B767. No inflight entertainment (just map tracking). No alcohol offered on board on any of the 2 flights. Ample seating space. Mediocre on board services - but somehow OK. Airbridge only provided in Singapore - had to walk while disembarking in POM and onwards.

I then after that realised that I would have to stay 2 weeks in PNG to be allowed to go to Honiara after visiting the Phillipines because of the coronavirus. My next plan is to book a flight direct to Vanuatu. The flight is listed as direct but at the last step I notice a 50 min stop in Honiara for dropping of / unloading passengers. (No disembarking.)

Unfortunately it turned out to be the worst airline travel experience to date. First our flight was cancelled after sitting at the boarding gate for 2hrs with no info other than 'there is an indefinite delay'. Then the flight was rescheduled for the next day, no info on our connecting flight was given until we arrived in Port Moresby from Vanuatu. The flight from Port Vila to Port Moresby was on a very old looking ATR aircraft, with no entertainment. Aircon was turned off for the 30 minute stopover in Honiara. Promises made by the Air Niugini ground staff to rebook my connecting domestic flights in the Philippines were not honoured and I was only advised of this after the scheduled domestic flights were missed, and only 5 minutes before boarding to Manila. No compensation was offered for the missed domestic flights or even an apology for providing the wrong information. Our baggage was then lost on arrival in Manila. 23 days later, there is still no sign of it and no compensation for lost bag to date. No response recieved to complaint email sent via website. Also no answer on phone numbers listed on website. Another complaint sent via agent in Vanuatu and response was simply 'fill out a form about your baggage' and 'our contract of carriage was only for Port Vila to Manila, no interline agreement'. So why did the staff advise otherwise? After losing baggage, buying new clothes and domestic flights (approx. $500), we requested an upgrade on return flight to have some positive experience with Air Niugini to look forward to. There was no response to this and the request at check in was rejected despite half of business class being empty. The airline also rejected the carriage of my traditional lanterns because Air Niugini exceptionally does not accept the carriage of any items that contain lights that aren't LED lights (I've successfully brought these lanterns in to Australia, USA, Vanuatu - never a problem). I requested they hold them until relatives could collect them the next day and was advised no storage space was available. After spending half a day driving to purchase them, I had to throw them away at the airport (another $100 lost). Air Niugini, you were such an epic disappointment and your poor service ruined our vacation. I understand flights occasionally get cancelled, baggage sometimes gets lost but your responses to customer issues relating to these things were inconsistent, incorrect or inadequate. In the future, I will avoid Air Niugini unless there are really no other options available. Don'tempted by their cheap prices!

Air Niugini customer review,1,2015-08-27,"I flew with Air Niugini, 24 August 2015 from Port Moresby to Bali with a B737-700. Overall not very good in service and the flight attendants did the minimum. Check in at POM Airport is very poor, just 2 ground staff to do that and they are very strict with baggage handling and baggage weight. On the B737-700 there were 7 flight attendants but just 2 working in Economy Class causing a very slow service.

Air Niugini customer review,8,2015-08-14,"The flight from BNE to POM was on a B767 with an upgraded interior. IFE and very comfortable seating. The inflight service was excellent, the flight attendant provided a professional helpful service complete with an indepth and accurate description of the wines carried for the passenger seated next to me. In addition this same passenger was a vegetarian but had not pre-ordered a vegetarian meal, the flight attendant produced a very acceptable vegetarian meal. Her level of customer care was above and beyond much of what I have encountered on many airlines and I left the flight feeling that the service was far more than expected.

When the flight from Alotau to Port Moresby was cancelled we were in a challenging situation, then when the rebooked flight from Alotau to Moresby couldn't land because of difficult weather conditions we had to overnight in Alotau and hope to connect early through a rescheduled flight from Alotau the following morning.

Air Niugini customer review,8,2014-01-04,SIN-POM-SIN on B767s. Friendly professional and efficient service from the crew made the flights bearable. Flights were largely on time. Exit row 10 had unbelievable leg room but it also meant other passengers climbed over us to get to the toilets in the other aisle. Food was ok. Touch-screen entertainment screens were great but bring your own headphones. Entertainment selection was limited.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,,True
Air Niugini customer review,5,2014-01-02,"PX4 BNE-POM 29/12. Re-fitted 767. Don't know who designed and who signed off the new economy layout but there are serious flaws. 2 toilets only for the whole of economy and they are situated mid cabin. There is no void space around the toilets so any queue just forms in the aisles. There is a seat right by the door to the toilet so this poor passenger cops the door opening and closing all flight plus the odour. Would be a nightmare seat on an overnight flight. Why is the ""latest technology"" entertainment system not gate to gate. I've had is turned on anywhere between 5 and 25 mins after the seatbelt sign was switched off and then turned off at the started of decent - 30 mins out. Result -movie not finished. Service slow mechanical. Food quite good. New seats ok for short flight but would be uncomfortable on longer haul - too hard and seat base too short -no under thigh support.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,,False
Air Niugini customer review,2,2013-10-23,One of the worst airlines I have ever flown with. Of course you can not expect much in a country like Papua New Guinea.

Air Niugini customer review,2,2008-06-12,MNL-POM-RAB return in Business. In the last five years flying with Air Niugini service and airplane quality has deteriorated dramatically.

Air Niugini customer review,1,2008-03-30,I have the misfortune of using Air Niugini often through lack of choice. Most recent flight was POM- SIN return. The airline is now leasing an aging White Airlines A310 which is older than the previous B767. Seats are appalling IFE does not work and toilets are constantly unservicable. The food is passable but really nothing special. Service is slow and Cabin crew seem unable to deal with complaints or concerns raised by passengers. Overall Air Niugini is not deserving of a three star ranking - a two star ranking would be more appropriate given the decline in the airline's international services.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False

Air Niugini customer review,2,2007-09-26,SIN-POM Busines Class. Check in at Singapore easy as we were early and able to take advantage of general early check in desk and also a separate Premium check-in area is available. Lounge at SIN is nice with a bit of food. Chaotic getting on plane with lot of pushing - we were sent down at a time when the Economy passengers were still queuing to go through security. Plane very hot and stuffy. Food edible - but you do not need 2 meals on an overnight 6 hour flight! Real problem are seats - the plane is a very tired leased 767 with seats that do not recline much and a poor foot-rest. They are the most uncomfortable seats I have experienced in either business class or economy for a long time. My husband could not sleep so put on his i-pod and was immediately told to turn it off as it was interfering with the radio. IFE did not work.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Air Niugini customer review,,2007-05-14,I have been working in Port Moresby for two years and am a regular Air Niugini passenger. Have flown with them to Singapore Tokyo and numerous times to Brisbane. Primary long haul aircraft is still a hard working leased 767-300. Fokker F100 sometimes used on the Brisbane route. Cabin is a bit tired and lacks a good entertainment system. The service is Air Niugini's real plus - always a smile and flight attendants willing to go the extra mile. Fare competitiveness has improved significantly over the past few years with the introduction of competition from Airlines PNG on the Cairns and Brisbane routes. Qantas flights in/out of Port Moresby are codeshare with Air Niugini using Air Niugini aircraft.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Air Niugini customer review,,2006-03-25,NRT-POM-BNE Business Class. It was a pleasant experience. FAs are efficient and friendly. I did not have much expectations for the IFE but was actually quite good. 3hour delay at Port Moresby but waiting at the executive lounge time went very quickly. Incidentally I never complain about delay when the airline company's priority is safety and paying extra attention to some fault even if its minor. I heard airliners in South Pacific region as well as Australia and NZ have very good safety record and I deeply appreciate and respect that.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Air Niugini customer review,,2006-02-07,CNS-POM-CNS + domestic. The cabin crew are friendly and I would fly with them more if they expanded their route network. Fares are steep but then they have a monopoly on the PNG market.

Air Niugini customer review,,2004-08-29,The service is always good the food often served cold training required there - the delays are ongoing - why?

Air Niugini customer review,,2004-05-12,BNE/POM/MNL/POM/BNE in April 2004. First time with this line. As Mr Tate says the cabin crew are shy but very helpful and courteous.

Air Niugini customer review,,2004-04-03,I would not hesitate to fly with Air Niugini Airlines again. I flew twice with them last year (2003) to Singapore and happened to have on board two of the same crew as my previous flight with them. They couldn't do enough for their passengers Qantas could take take a leaf out of their book. I no longer fly with Qantas as I find the staff always trying to avoid going that extra mile especially when it comes to night flights.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Air Niugini customer review,,2004-01-17,BNE-POM-BNE Economy. service great flight was full food served promptly the IFE wasn't so good but Air NZ is too blame for that. Fare was cheap.
