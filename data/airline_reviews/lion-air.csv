Then 1.5 hours later, we negotiated security again and arrived at the gate - and there was a further 1 hour delay.

They briefed passengers in the exit rows about their duties. There was a seat empty on the exit row so a cabin member was asking people if they would like to sit in the exit row. 5) Crew were not good with English skills, their airline magazine also has no english content at all. 6) Price was amazing compared to other carriers.

No compensation when one customer complained and at last minute Padang food appeared with no implements to eat and way too late. Onboard they briefly apologized as flight late for ""operational reasons"". My understanding is this is a common occurrence for this flight. This airline has no customer care or communications capability.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Lion Air customer review,2,2012-03-02,SUB-SIN and SIN-SUB. Cheap price since it's a new route with high load factor. Cramped seats for SIN bound flights and spacious seat on return flight in emergency exit row and bulkhead which you can ask for free. Only snacks and mineral water offered at expensive prices and crews only provide immigration cards during the flight. Airline's magazine is only form of entertainment.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Lion Air customer review,,2012-02-16,Jakarta to Tarakan via Balikpapan. Seat pitch is the smallest I have seen on any airline. Boarding in Jakarta was from both the front door and rear door. They have assigned seats so people boarding from the rear door were trying to move up to the front of the plane. Needless to say this is impossible. The amount of pushing and shoving is brutal. Left 23 minutes late due to boarding. Inflight nothing is offered on a 2+ hour flight. Flight attendants are young and stay in the galley with the curtain closed. The 737-900ER holds over 225 people. They only have 3 toilets - that's it.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Lion Air customer review,4,2012-01-21,Jakarta-Kuala Lumpur and Singapore-Jakarta. Check-in crews were okay. Most announcements were recorded no meal or drink. A choice of orange juice or water would be appreciated. Seat was very hard magazine onboard boring and crews weren't interested in serving passengers. The only good thing is the value of money (if you buy tickets early).,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Lion Air customer review,1,2012-01-03,CGK-SIN-CGK. The seat was terrible with very little leg room the FA's disappeared during the flight no presence at all and the toilet was dirty. On the way back to Jakarta the air conditioner was extremely cold however the mood lighting gave a little comfort and that was the only positive thing I took from the flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Lion Air customer review,,2011-11-26,Mataram Lombok to Denpasar. We arrived at the airport 15.00 for our 17.40 flight and according to staff and the monitors the flight was on time. As the departure time passed passengers went to check-in staff and asked what was happening we were informed the flight would be delayed and would depart at 22.15. No reason given for the delays. 22.15 came and still no sign of a flight. At 22.50 I went to the check-in staff and demanded to know what was happening. Nobody knew and they informed us the flight must have been cancelled and we would probably be taken to Denpasar the following morning. Finally a time came in at 00.15am some 10 hrs after we had checked in. I am angry that staff did not keep us informed of what was happening and still today we do not know why the plane was delayed more than 8 hours. Extremely poor service by not only Lion Air but the ground staff as well.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Lion Air customer review,1,2011-09-28,Jakarta to Solo trip was horrible. Drinks are not given but sold they aren't cold and they don't serve the drinks with ice either. Extremely loud announcements no entertainment. The plane was pretty dirty and my seat pocket didn't have the magazine. In my row only one seat pocket had a magazine.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Lion Air customer review,10,2011-09-08,SIN-CGK-MDC. Flights on time. Brand new planes nice looking interior. They accept US issued credit cards unlike other carriers. 20 kg of luggage is included in the price of ticket.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Lion Air customer review,6,2011-09-06,SIN-CGK-SIN. Booking is to the point. Unlike other carriers offering you - upgrades for baggage allowance better seat inflight meal and so on. 1hr delay is normal especially in CGK on evening flight. Seat pocket is dirty and not cleaned from the previous leg. Overall recommended if what you are looking for is just to get from point A to point B.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Lion Air customer review,2,2011-08-29,Manado to Makassar and to Jakarta. Nothing was offered on the first leg not even a cup of water. We did not see the crew at all. On the 2nd leg only 1 cup of water given and a small selection of snacks for sale after that. Again your don't see the crew at all after distribution of items. Disembarkation through the rear exit while the stewardess stood leaning against the wall with her arms folded. The only good thing about the flight and airline was that it was on time the seating was really very cramped.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Lion Air customer review,3,2011-08-18,CGK-DPS-CGK. They take you from A to B and that's it. Web check-in was not functioning. Last minute change on departure gate. Delays seems to be normal when flying with them the only positive was the cheap fare.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Lion Air customer review,9,2011-08-07,My trip from Changi to Jakarta was pleasant I choose the seat near the emergency door and the leg stretch is very good. The trip back was nice and smooth it is a no gimmick airline. For me you've got what you pay.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Lion Air customer review,3,2011-06-06,Pangkal Pinang (Bangka) to Jakarta what should be a one-hour flight. Flight delayed by 4.5 hours and almost no information given. I eventually found out that the plane was still in Jakarta awaiting the pilot. After a one-hour delay we were given chicken and rice (horrid if you're a vegetarian but that's Indonesia for you!). After that nothing - not even a word about compensation. The staff were fine onboard - it's the management who need a serious shake- up if they think a 4.5 hour delay for a 1-hour flight is in any way acceptable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Lion Air customer review,8,2011-05-26,JOG to Lombok via SUB and DPS. Flights operated by Wings air new ATR planes good staff no food for sale as flights just over 1 hour. All flights on time. Very clean planes.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Lion Air customer review,4,2011-03-17,SIN-SGN on new 737-900ER. Flight wasn't full. Small snack box with a bun and cake provided plus a drink. After clearing stewardess no where to be seen. Little regards to safety with mobile phones ringing in mid flight. Flight departed on time and arrived with minimal fuss. Good thing is it departs from Terminal 1 in Singapore.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Lion Air customer review,6,2011-01-15,Flew with Lion few times while I was in Indonesia for holiday. CGK-MDC MDC-DPS-MDC. It wasn't a very good experience checking-in at Soekarno Hatta crowded and very unorganised! Could hardly move and food wasn't included. Flights were on time though which was a good thing. It wasn't a bad experience but wasn't the best either.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Lion Air customer review,2,2011-01-14,SIN-CGK on new B737-900. Booking was good website efficient and easy. Flight was delayed for about 45 minutes without any notice. During take off and landing there is one passenger who never set his seat upright and FAs don't bother to remind him. Seat pitch very poor. Baggage claim at CGK is a havoc. Baggage carousel is changed without any notice and a very long time to have your baggage on the belt.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Lion Air customer review,,2010-11-22,Flight Jakarta to Bali was 2 hours delayed. Return flight 3 hours delayed. I tried to call their service center several times but no one answers the phone. No notification of delays until you get to the airport. Time is extremely important when traveling. It is obvious that despite their reasonably low fares they don't care for their customers. I will never fly this airline again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Lion Air customer review,4,2010-07-02,Jakarta-Jogya wasn't a pleasant experience. Plane 1hour late - no info/announcements. Departure lounge overflowing with passengers from 3 late Lion flights. Plane (B737) dirty and shabby with indifferent cabin crew (no checks to see bags properly stowed seats upright for landing/take off etc). Website is good but this doesn't make up for other problems.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Lion Air customer review,7,2010-05-08,"First pro is their web site very easy and no hidden costs the spring up as you progress into the booking process. Aircraft mostly new and clean with friendly staff. Flight service is limited seat pitch 28"" for coach and 32 for business. Very tight however was on request was given a long leg seat with a smile and no charge.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Lion Air customer review,,2009-08-09,CGK - Lombok DPS - CGK on new 737-900. Using the domestic terminal in Jakarta it was pretty hectic. One thing that bothered me the crew did not check the name on the boarding pass with our ID. The flight to Lombok was delayed for an hour while we were onboard. Seats and service were decent since we were using the old plane. Getting back from Bali to Jakarta was terrible. Using the new B737-900 the seats was seriously tight - have never flown any plane with seats that uncomfortable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Lion Air customer review,1,2009-03-15,"CGK-DEN-CGK. CGK-DEN delayed by 2 hours to 11am due to technical problems so Lion Air gave a lunch box - not bad but not appetizing. I went to the Manager on Duty to ask for an earlier flight on another airline (as I was planning to return the same day) but they couldn't find a seat on another airline. When I reminded her that Garuda had a flight leaving soon she said she didn't check with Garuda. They were definitely overwhelmed with complaints. The seat was the most uncomfortable seat I've ever been on. I'm only 171cm (5'7"") but my knees touched the seat in front of me. No service onboard not even a glass of water or anybody going around the cabin selling anything. If they dont improve the service I wont use them anymore.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Lion Air customer review,2,2009-03-13,DPS-CGK new B737-900. The aircraft condition although it is brand new but dirty many spots on the leather seat trash on the carpet which shows that they do not clean it properly. FA only did the safety demonstration do the snack & drinks selling and the rest of the flight they chit chat on the pantry. Some of the FA announcement are recorded. Another things some passengers are still doing some activity while the fasten seat belt sign is on and the FA did not warn the passenger to go back to their seat. I believe that Lion Air should upgrade their services and FA skills/knowledge.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Lion Air customer review,4,2008-12-01,CGK to KUL return. Didn't expect much as had poor experiences with Lion in the past but was pleasantly surprised. Check-in very orderly both flights arrived absolutely on time and the fare was very competitive indeed. No food or IFE. Everything else was no-frills - but seats are allocated and flight operates to the proper passenger terminal at KUL and not the awful LCCT so I'd say that Lion has the edge over the other low-cost operator on this route Air Asia.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Lion Air customer review,3,2008-11-21,"SIN - CGK one way flight on time with new B737-900ER. Seat pitch was very tight (around 28"") - very hard to sit and move around. The 1.5hr journey was like a shuttle bus - no services and you cannot even purchase any foods or drinks. FAs were attentive as call button answered immediately.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Lion Air customer review,4,2008-10-23,SIN-DPS-SIN both flights using the new B737-900ER. Cabin clean bright and airy. I was impressed that food (hot meal dessert and salad - all served on a tray) + drinks were served for both flights. Pity that load factor for both legs was less than 40% and no inflight entertainment was offered at all. It's a great flying experience overall.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Lion Air customer review,4,2008-08-26,Singapore-Bali on new 737-900. Low fare with Good Service. Seat a bit hard Food provided is enough but not nice. Return Flight delay about 50 min. Overall still satisfied with Lion Air.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Lion Air customer review,3,2008-08-11,JOG - CGK. I guess this airline is fair. Our flight was cancelled and the flight we were put onto was about 3 hours late (it was due to leave about 2 hours before our flight). But they were very efficient in transferring us onto another flight. They even got everybody a donut and water. So full credit to the Jogjakarta customer services.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Lion Air customer review,5,2008-07-14,DPS-CGK-DPS. Both legs using new Boeing 737-900 ER. Departed on-time even early. Cabin was clean. No more free drink. All foods and drinks are for purchase. Seat pitch quite tight. Overall I was satisfied flying on Lion Air.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Lion Air customer review,,2008-06-19,SIN-DPS-SIN on 737-900ER. Latest entrant on the 'prized' route and had to take advantage of low fares not available for past two years. Single class cabin seats rather hard but typical of such carriers slight recline snack box and free drinks provided. Returning flight at 12am was delayed for 2 hours ground staff provided mini dinner snack box which most passengers left untouched. Delay was informed upon check in. Cabin crew pleasant call button answered almost immediately drinks requests tended to quickly. The major difference between Lion and the rest of the budget carriers is that they do not hawk duty free sales so once meal service is completed passengers are left undisturbed. Both flights not completely full despite the very attractive fares. One reason could be due to the bad publicity Indonesian carriers have been receiving. Extremely value-for-money service something we should not take for granted in these times.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Lion Air customer review,,2006-02-26,Padang-Jakarta sector - airline seems more like a shuttle. No food was provided  but the ubiquitous water cup which you get on every public transport in Indonesia.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
