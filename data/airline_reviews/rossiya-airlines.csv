"""an underwhelming experience""",4,2017-06-07,"✅ Verified Review |  Moscow to Petropavlovsk. Needing to go to Kamchatka for work, I decided to pay for business class, as I didn't fancy the 8-hour flight from Moscow in economy. Nominally part of Aeroflot, Rossiya Airlines is nevertheless far from an equal to its mother company, and I was disappointed when I realised that the flight was operated by RA, as I have come to esteem Aeroflot on longhaul routes in both business and economy. Online check in was easy, and baggage drop was handled at Berlin Tegel by UTAir, who flew me the first leg. On arrival at Moscow's Vnukovo airport, I went to the pretty decent Rossiya Airlines lounge where I used the wireless, had a coffee and ate some fruit before going to board. Business class passengers (both of us) had a small shuttle to the plane, which allowed us at least to skip the crowded main bus. The plane itself was freshly painted with a gorgeous mural of an Amur Leopard's face plastered over the nose, which looked amazing. Inside, however, the cabin was quite aged, but the welcome was warm (one stewardess spoke English well) and I was glad that the business cabin was empty. The stewardess informed me that the entire plane's entertainment system was not working, as if she was letting me know that one of the meal options was unavailable: she seemed totally unbothered by this, and while of course I was prepared with my laptop and a bunch of series, this seemed really poor and I would have been furious had I be flying west and wasn't intending to sleep. A meal was served promptly after take off (salmon, rice and vegetables, salad and a dessert) that was of the standard you'd expect on a medium quality European airline's economy section, and then I went to sleep. The business seats recline fairly well, to around 80% and were fairly comfortable, meaning I got at least 6 hours of shut eye, which was the main point of flying business. A meaty breakfast and undrinkable coffee were served over the volcanoes of Kamchatka the following morning, before touching down in Petropavlovsk. Definitely an underwhelming experience, next time I will try to ensure I fly with Aeroflot proper rather than one of its subsidiaries, but overall I got what I paid for.",False,Boeing 777-300,Business,Business Class,Moscow to Petropavlovsk,June 2017,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",2,2,,False,
"""nothing outside of the ordinary""",5,2017-02-28,"✅ Verified Review |  I took a trip on Aeroflot from Moscow to St. Petersburg operated by Rossiya Airlines. I booked the flight late, so I paid a considerable premium on the ticket. That said, it was cheaper than the roundtrip ticket on the Sapsan high-speed train from Moscow to Peter. As expected for a holiday weekend, the flight was at or near capacity. The A319 had more leg room than my last flight on the A319 I flew with S7 airlines, but not much more.  Boarding is not by zones, or by class it seems in Russia. It is whoever gets in line first, and a bit chaotic. The line typically forms quickly before boarding, and it is better to be early in line. Basic economy traveling is cheap within Russia, but like airlines worldwide the charges add up with luggage, etc. So everyone tries to just bring carry-on bags. Therefore, if you have carry-on luggage, you need to get in the line early or you might not find any overhead storage space. The flight is relatively short, about 1.5 hours, so you can tolerate a little discomfort. The flight attendents were professional, but not friendly. Once airborne, they hastily served a small, rather tasteless snack and choice of water, tea or coffee - no juice or alcoholic beverages. The temperature in the cabin was very warm - an experience that I have had on every flight I have taken inside of Russia. Russians tend to like it warm, but this was a bit too warm. On the return flight to Moscow, we sat in a holding pattern above Vnukovo airport for about 45 minutes and ended up reaching the gate 35 minutes late. No reason given by the pilot when he informed us of the delay, but delays sometimes happen because Vnukovo-2 is used for flights of high-ranking government officials. Overall, since I booked the tickets late it was an expensive flight, so value for the money might be skewed to the negative. However, that was my fault.

Needless to say I was upset, and demanded answers from the head Stewardess, who could clearly see that my old seat was crossed out with a pen, and my original seat, 9C, was not honored. She tried to convince me in poor English to take a middle seat in the Exit row. I was not happy about it, but realized I lost the battle. A few minutes later the same head Stewardess offered me an aisle seat with the one next to me empty. It was a nice gesture, and proved that she cared about my complaint.

Rossiya Airlines customer review,3,2015-06-07,I used Rossiya around 30-35 times within last 12 months due to frequent trips to St Petersburg where Rossiya has its home base. Some good things happened due to integration of Rossiya and Aeroflot ground handing. Aeroflot is a quite civilized business so they taught Rossiya check in staff how to organize check in and how to politely serve customers. Ticket office services even despite coming to Aeroflot brand remain slow and helpless with insufficient staffing. Online services have all migrated to aeroflot.ru so all work fine. For some reason Rossiya still maintains its own website (quite shabby though) but clicking to check in or ticket purchase will all lead to aeroflot.ru. Inflight experience is well deserved 2 star with every effort put not to allow it to become 3 star. Meal service is the worst in the air (inedible sandwich plus cup of tea/coffee that are better not to taste). Bring your own food and drink from the airport. Their aircraft are second hand A319 with median age about 20 years or same aged B767-300 where seat configuration is 2-4-2. Toilets are old type (non-vacuum) so some terrible smells have accumulated within their lifetime. Legroom is non-existent on every plane type so I always try to get seat in emergency row. Seat comfort is the worst part of travel with them. Unbearable and painful if you're on a long flight. The crews are old soviet style. Even younger ones miss normal modern communication skills. Their English is usually incomprehensible so I don't get how foreign passengers can get flight info or even being communicated with. But there is one strong reason why this company is 2 star not 1 star. They are always on time. Not a single flight I was on have been more than 5-7 minutes late. Never.

Seat pitch was fine plane was exceptionally old still had ash trays smelt of musky smoke must have been flying in the 1960's. Flight staff dont speak English only Russian which was ok no need to talk to them. Flight was delayed by an hour or so due to snow. Actual flight was a bit scary... never been scared on any flight before but Rossiya Air brings about a whole new flying experience. I probably would fly them again if I was desperate or on a tight budget otherwise fly BA or Finnair.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Rossiya Airlines customer review,8,2009-12-20,STO-LED Boeing 737. Efficient flights but be prepared for a strange service concept. You are offered a non-alcoholic drink tea/coffee and a chocolate bar regardless of its early morning flight or a late night one. It's a short flight so you might survive anyway but in this respect I prefer the competitor on this destination SAS where you can at least choose what you want to buy.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Rossiya Airlines customer review,7,2009-11-15,LGW-LED-LGW. Usually I fly BA but the ticket price with Rossiya was much cheaper than usual. I booked 3 days before departure e-ticket as standard. Flight from Gatwick registration quick and easy. Outbound flight an A320 approx 40% filled. Seat pitch excellent. The interior look is slightly tired but seats are nice. Inbound flight an old ex-Aer Lingus B737-500 filled to 80% capacity. Aircraft interior in a tired state. Food great as it was a typical Russian mash potato with beef. As an overall evaluation very good value for money.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Rossiya Airlines customer review,2,2008-12-31,A frequent flyer with GTK Rossiya since I have to travel a lot within CIS and Europe. Recently I have decided to give up the choice in favour for this airline for good. First and major issue is there online booking service. Even if you have booked a flight online and you cc was charged it does not mean you are done. Often flights are being cancelled. Customer service do not even bother to inform the passengers about the changes in advance they just rebook you for another flight on another date (that happens!) and then refuse to make a full refund if you decide to completely cancel your itinerary due to the fact they have cancelled the flight on exact date you needed. To reach their head office in St Petersburg by phone is a nearly impossible mission since it is permanently busy. Reaching customer support toll free number is useless since they will anyway send you out for a personal visit to their office. As you can imagine it is very handful for business travellers. Visit to the office is a guaranteed 2 hours waiting in a queue. A typical Russian service for a not so cheap price after all. They do not have to care about customers satisfaction since they will anyway hold up to 60% of the market. There are basically only two sufficient airlines in Russia - Rossiya and Aeroflot. Both state owned and both with beyond bad approach to customers. Unfortunately no other choice. Its a shame that a huge country like Russia with distances of up to 10000 km from Central to Far East destinations can not offer its citizens an airline we could be proud of. Do not fly with Rossiya Airlines unless you have no other choice of course.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Rossiya Airlines customer review,6,2008-11-25,A major carrier serving St Petersburg (formerly Pulkovo Airlines). I was flying LED-CDG route on them and the airline is mediocre. Not bad actually but if you compare it to Air France ageing Boeing attendants looking tired nothing special meal. But what can you expect from the ticket cost round trip 150$? Nothing special indeed.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
