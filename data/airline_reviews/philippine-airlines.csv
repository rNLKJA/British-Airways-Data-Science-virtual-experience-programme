"""overall were OK, nothing special""",4,2022-11-18,"Pricewise this is the cheapest airline on this route. But a 6 hour longer detour. Flights overall were OK, nothing special. Food and service on both flights so so. Very limited choice and not very tasty. Staff not very attentive, however on this point I must say that wearing these facemasks does not contribute. All by all nothing special and in our view an airline at the lower end of the spectrum. Pretty good seat and plenty of leg room on the A321. In the A330 the inflatable cushion of the seat was not working and one of us had to sit on the metal frame. Maintenance staff could not solve the issue, cabin staff finally offered a pillow. Not very comfortable on a night flight. Lying flat (lie flat seat) it was pretty OK. The transfer on NAIA was an absolute disaster. It had a major impact on the overall experience hence our overall view on PAL. We had 3 hours to transfer, and it took us 2 ¾ hour. Ground staff is keeping themselves busy with inexplicable activities, leaving a queue of hundreds of passengers who had to crawl through a very small space, in the dark. First, one had to obtain a small stamp on the boarding pass (for what reason unclear, nothing was additionally checked) after that the cabin luggage had to be scanned again (was already scanned in SIN), suitcases had to be picked out and opened for another check (drugs?) with a cotton wool pad but without putting it in an analyser. Afterwards the suitcases were loaded. Finally at the gate the cabin luggage was scanned again. The experience on NAIA was absolutely stressful, to put it mild. The final question is: would we fly PAL again?

"""booking a flight is painful""",1,2022-11-15,"Over the last 10 years my husband and/or me have flown PAL roundtrip from LAX to Manila about 20 times. Flights are generally good, mostly on time, great crew, lousy food. However, their website and booking/refund policies are the worst. Almost every time we fly, their website has a problem with my credit card, then we have to spend at least an hour to call them, find the reservation, verify everything, then pay over the phone. This week I tried to book a flight, credit card rejected 4 times (Southwest Airlines VISA card with $35K credit limit that I charge everything to without issues), called, and by time we got through all the preliminary stuff the low rate I had online was gone. So we had to choose between changing my wife's family time by a day, or pay a higher fare. I have fought with customer service repeatedly over these issues to no avail. The last time this happened the customer service agent said this is a known problem and they are working on it. Really? For 9 years? I had to cancel a flight during COVID, waited 5 months for refund. Then they never fully refunded the extra charge for a good seat. BTW, now all of their aisle seats are a $20 surcharge. I have had cases where I tried to book the flight online, credit card rejected, I call, the first person finds the reservation and confirms everything, then I get transferred to another person who has to confirm everything again, then takes my credit card info and processes it, then transferred to a 3rd person who has to confirm everything again and does the seat assignments. On any other airline you can do this online in 10 minutes or less, no problem. Maybe the extra customer service expense is part of why they're in bankruptcy. Bottom line, flights are OK, booking a flight is painful, and the only reason we fly PAL is they are the only airline with direct flights from LA to Manila.

At about 18:30, one of the staff walked around telling people there was a slight delay due to mechanical issues being checked. There seemed to be no intercom system in the terminal, so it was difficult to hear what was being said. There were then no further announcements. At about 21:45, I asked the agent if there was an update and was told boarding would start at about 22:15 for a departure of 23:00. Still enough time to make our connecting flight. At about 22:45, still no announcements so asked again and was told there was another issue with the plane and no time frame was known. I then went to the business class lounge to get assistance with changing our connecting flight. The desk staff said they could not assist as it was a separate ticket. They did call customer service who also said they could not do anything to help at all. While having that conversation, they found out the flight would be canceled. I was told we would be given a hotel for the night and flight would be figured out. Us and about 20 other passengers were told to go with the agent to be taken thru immigration, to the ticket desk and to the hotel. When we arrived at the immigration counter, the agent said we were not allowed to leave the airport as we were transfer passengers. This seemed to be a surprise to the airline staff. We were then taken to the transfer desk and told business class passengers would be treated as a priority. We would have to leave our passports with immigration but could then go to the hotel before the replacement flight. When I asked when we would fly the agent was evasive and unclear. I eventually was able to find out we would fly the next afternoon at 15:30. Why we weren’t told this immediately remains a mystery.

We had to use the Manila airport to transit to Los Angeles on PAL102. I have no problem with Philippine Airlines. They provide a great flying service for a reasonable price. Our issue is: that if you have to fly on Philippine Airlines, then you have to use the Manila International Airport as it is PALs main hub, which is a very serious problem for tourist transiting the Philippines. The terminal we transited through is old and extremely outdated. No decent restaurants are available in the terminal. Also, very stuffy and no air circulation in the terminal. A poor excuse for a 4 star airline like PAL who has to use as their main hub. The facility is filthy and overcrowded. Security lines are long. To transit from one PAL aircraft to another PAL aircraft, we had to go through 3 different lines for 3 different security checks. 1. Had to stand in a long line for a document check. Had to wait in a small unventilated room for our checked in luggage to arrive for another inspection where each of our bags were checked. My wife almost passed out in there due to no air con and lack of ventilation in that room. 3. Another long line at the gate for another full security check. At that time, there was over 700 people waiting for PAL flights to Honolulu and Los Angeles. Don't understand why PAL schedules these flights at the same time next to each other. Once through the 3rd security check, it was very difficult to find available seats in the boarding area. Also, once in the gate area, there are no bathroom facilities until you board your aircraft. Gate agents said if you really need to go, you have to go back through the security checkpoint for another inspection.

The agent seemed as worried as I was as she kept looking at her watch due to the forty-five minute check-in cut off time. Then a supervisor walked out with our copied documentation and asked for my marriage certificate and child’s birth certificate. They seemed to be worried that my wife was flying with her maiden name passport, although with Filipino tradition my child has my wife’s maiden name as their middle name. After several rounds of checking and double checking the supervisor gave to ok! After check in I preceded to security for the routine ID and bag check.

Due to aircraft operational issues in Manila, this flight was rescheduled to depart and arrive two hours later than originally scheduled. We were informed of this one full week in advance. Upon arrival at check-in, I was given two surprises. One was that my pre-selected aisle seat had suddenly been changed to a middle seat. The other was that I was given a $20 meal voucher. I'm still not entirely sure whether the meal voucher was given because of the changed seat assignment or because of the later departure. At any rate, the flight departed exactly on time and arrived about 40 minutes early to Manila. This was perfect, as it meant I basically cleared customs and immigration in Manila at the scheduled arrival time. The flight safety video was restarted midway through, but from that point onward, there were no issues with the inflight entertainment seatback monitors for the remainder of the flight. Still no games available and still no subtitles for films, though (except for those which automatically came with subtitles in their original version, as was the case with some of the Filipino films). The food was fine, although it was less interesting than on my earlier flight from Manila to New York. I was also a bit disappointed that there appeared to be no peanut butter in the sauce for my caldereta. Rolls were served by placing them onto our entree boxes during meals--except that during breakfast, they seem not to have served rolls to any of us in my section.

The biggest problem, however, during this flight pertained to the lavatories. The drains for the sinks appeared to be clogged, and we ran out of toilet paper midway through the flight. I was somewhat nervous when using the lavatory at times when there was periodic turbulence, out of fear that the water standing in the sinks might spill out.

No white bread or rolls, just brown rolls, a few items of salad sides, jam and crackers and cheese. As a PAL passenger I was entitled to a small bowl of Chicken Arroz Caldo. The choice of drinks available was what I would have expected. My seat number was 2A, a front seat on the left hand of the aircraft.

"""I enjoyed my flight""",8,2019-06-03,"Manila to New York. I don't normally fly this route, as I live closer to Clark in the Philippines and closer to Boston in the United States.  I originally had plans in New York this time though, so I had an excuse to try this route. Unfortunately, our plane was 35 minutes late to arrive at our gate in Manila. Gate staff asked people to volunteer to check luggage as the flight was supposedly fully booked. However, upon boarding, I found that there were many seats which were never occupied. Otherwise, the gate staff handled the boarding professionally given the late arrival of the plane. We would have made up for some lost time if it were not for delays for taking off. On board the aircraft, the seats were comfortable. I was particularly pleased I was able to fit my small traveling bag in the seatback pocket in front of me. (That doesn't always happen.) An adequate amenities kit was provided. I found the safety video shown to be quite touching--and very Pinoy. As for the food, I was honestly surprised by how creative some of the meals offered were. (The food I have had on Philippine Airlines in the past was usually good, but simpler.) We were served two full meals and a ""hot snack,"" which was basically like a full meal without the standard salad and roll. It was just the right amount of food for the flight--not too little, and not too much. I was a bit disappointed at first that the flight attendants did not come through the cabin offering water and/or juice between services, but I later realized it was a good thing in that I felt no pressure to accept such drinks. I did, however, get very thirsty at one point and pressed the call button. A flight attendant arrived, already carrying a cup of water for me. Impressive! One thing I do not understand, however, is why there is no pineapple juice available. I mean, pineapple juice is found pretty much anywhere in the Philippines. And if Philippine Airlines took a walk on the wild side and offered something like Del Monte Pineapple-Blueberry juice, then the airline could gain a cult following over it, like Jet Blue's serving blue potato chips on their flights in the United States. It would be something that stands out. Perhaps the biggest issue I found with this flight was the entertainment system. While I appreciate that individual seatback monitors were available, there were three big issues. One was that the system had to be rebooted in the middle of the flight and was stalling repeatedly before that reboot happened. The second was that there appeared not to be any games available. The third was a lack of subtitles for films. It seems odd that the Korean and Chinese films did not have subtitles in English or Tagalog. Even for films in English, I know that many Filipinos would appreciate subtitles in English, as the subtitles make it easier for them to understand the film. Lastly, the price for my round-trip ticket was typical of Philippine Airlines: not really expensive, but also not cheap. This is one area where Philippine Airlines could improve.

"""not worthy of a 4-star experience""",1,2019-05-04,"Manila to Iloilo City with Philippine Airlines. This trip was plagued with problems and not worthy of a 4-star experience. Problem #1: We purchased a business class ticket and were notified by email about five hours before the flight departed that the aircraft was changed and no longer has a business class, therefore we were downgraded to Premium Economy. Problem #2: A week before our trip, we purchased extra baggage, as we knew we had more than the baggage limit. When checking in at the airport, the check-in person could not figure out how to accommodate the pre-paid baggage and it took well over one hour for her to figure out how to enter it in the system. We had to wait in the check-in area (where there's no seating) to wait for this to be resolved. Problem #3: We, of course, wanted to be compensated for the downgrade. We were offered both a free ticket to use in 6 months (non-transferrable) and 1500 pesos (roughly US$30 each) in cash. First, we were told that we'd get the paperwork in the lounge. It never came, but right before the aircraft door closed, we were given the vouchers and papers to sign. The person who gave us the papers said we could go to the Iloilo office and get the compensation refund. We waited for 2 hours in that office and they said that they could only use the compensation towards another flight, which was completely different from what the Manila rep told us. After waiting for two hours, we complained to the manager who wouldn't budge.

For example, the last flight I took (Manila-San Francisco), the regular meal options were a chicken sausage dish with some mashed potatoes and veggies, a wonderful colorful julienne vegetable salad, a flan pudding (GF by nature) and some bread with butter. The other option was a delicious smelling pork belly over rice (seriously some of the best pork belly I’ve ever had) and some veggies with the same sides. Everything was gluten-free except for the bread roll and looked much more colorful and fresher overall. By contrast, the GF “special” meal that I received was a plain chicken breast with no salt, steamed veggies that were overcooked and mushy to the point of colorless baby food, with no spices or sauces, a watered-down fruit salad, a rice cake with no butter and a banana instead of dessert. I was amazed at how bland and flavorless it was. Gluten-free does not mean sugar-free, low-fat, or dairy free. It simply means the absence of wheat flour. I still like sauces and spices. And I still like butter. A non-fruit dessert would have been nice. And since when does gluten-free mean flavor-free? I would have preferred the regular meal option with just a gluten-free rice cake substitute. Thank god they had extra regular meals for me to eat instead.

Moreover, PAL and Travel Tax office are pin pointing to each other as to where will I get the refund, and until now I am still waiting for their responses. Bookings made thru agents/hotline cannot be accessed to their website, not until 24 hours before your departure. So there's no way to confirm your booking online before that. There is no IFE, you have to download their MyPAL Player app to access their IFE.  No amenity kit provided on this leg.

It started off weird at the Manila when the check in person told me that I needed to pay a terminal fee in exchange for my boarding pass. It was cheap so I was fine with it. But I couldn’t figure out where to pay the fee and there was no sign to say where to pay it. I asked a few ground staff and they told me that I don’t need to pay because I’m holding an Australian Passport. But nonetheless they were very friendly and approachable. And one of the ground staff finally helped me out and even walked me to the place where I needed to pay. He waited with me at the line and we had a nice chat. Once it was my turn, he left and wished me good luck to my travels. When I returned to the check in, he gave me my boarding pass. He then asked if I had any glass or breakable objects. I told him I have some souvenirs that might break. And just with that, he placed a fragile sticker on the bag with no hesitation. I was pretty happy and very relieved and confident that my bag’s contents wouldn’t break. Then at immigration, the line was short and there was no wait at all, despite the hundreds, even thousands of people in the airport. The departure hall was small and there was a lot of people. But enough seats and charging ports for everyone and a good wifi connectivity. The plane was new and quiet. No TV but had a streaming service which had a great selection of TV and Movies.

This is far different from the old PAL that I had experienced. However the TAG to CRK flight was a big let down. My seat was dirty, there were left over chewing gum wrapper, contents of the seat pocket incomplete, no bottled water and service was inconsistent. For example, the lady two rows ahead of me was provided with a blanket however when I asked for one, the stewardess said they only provided blankets for international flights. Instead they would lower the cabin temp so that we don't feel cold. The temperature was never adjusted and when I approached a different crew, he gave me a blanket without hesitation. PAL has recently also recently been aggressive advertising the following amenities (food, free luggage allowance, blankets on flights, new seats retrofits, and warm service). Food although present is inconsistent, For example, my CRK to TAG flight say would serve water but return flight did not have this and would instead serve you a small cup of water around 100ml. This far from the food service of other airlines I have flown regionally (eg. SQ). Blankets not available on all flights. Official social media accounts cannot even confirm if they have amenities on specific flights. No listing which routes are served with reconfigured seats.

Let me start by saying that I have been taking flights between London and Auckland (return) for the past 9 years. I always try to take different routes so I can experience different stopovers and different airlines. The first leg from Auckland to Manila was on the A340 and was a terrible experience. I have never been on a long haul flight which didnt have an entertainment system (TV screens in the seat in front) until I flew on this aeroplane! The plane appeared to be very old and run down, very old style seats which were uncomfortable. There was no legroom at all for me (I am 6' or 1.80m tall) my knees were jammed into the seat in front. They handed out iPads for passengers to use to view movies on the 10 hour flight, however they didn't hand these out until we were 3 hours into the flight and then collected them back about 1 hour before landing. The service on the flight was very average with little or no effort made by the cabin crew, we were required to keep walking down to the kitchen to ask for water which was handed out 1 cup at a time. The staff gave the impression that they were constantly annoyed at being asked for anything. Conversely on the second leg from Manila to London we were on a new B777. This flight was much better, entertainment system, quieter, more comfortable, acceptable leg room, however the service from the cabin crew was still very poor. Overall if Philipine Airlines improved their crew service and plane fleet they would be an acceptable option in the future.

I received one meal during the flight, a dinner, which was almost entirely inedible. There was supposed to be another meal but I did not get it (not sure why, I saw that trolley go past but perhaps they had run out of food). I was seated in the last row of the plane, the light was on behind me the entire journey. When we got to Heathrow we taxied and parked and then we lost power to the plane.  There was no in-flight entertainment. There was an app that you could download before boarding the aircraft which was not advertised at all - the first I knew about it was when I got to the seat (and it was obviously too late to download).

On the Heathrow to Manila flight there was again no in-flight entertainment, but I had downloaded the app and it worked tolerably well (stuck in a few places due to the wifi speed). I was fed two meals on this flight but for both meals the meat portion was intolerable. They had also run out of the most popular choice of chicken (I was seated half way down in economy), so there was no choice of meal.

I got an email the day I was due to fly saying my flight was cancelled, no next steps or anything. Tried to phone the UK contact centre that I booked my flight through (PAL direct not an agent, stupidly I thought that was safer), they aren't open weekends! This was a Saturday and I was due to leave for the airport in a matter of hours when I got the cancellation email (mere hours after the flight reminder email). I paid a fortune to sit on hold on the phone to their Manila office, only to be told it was cancelled repeatedly with no suggestions other than for me to go to the airport and see if there was a Philippine Airline customer service team there (they couldn't confirm whether there was or not) and see if there was anything they could do to get me on another flight. Given this didn't sound promising I phoned back to speak to someone else. Eventually managed to get to speak to someone else, and booked on the next flight which wasn't for over another 24 hours. At no point did anyone acknowledge the cost to me of this cancellation (I had hotels, transfers and tours booked to follow on from the flight) or the fact that I lost over 24 hours in the Philippines and didn't get to do the tours I'd booked at all in the end because of this cancelation. Communication was really poor the whole way through and when I asked any questions I just got 'it's cancelled ma'am' or 'hello?' as the answer, it was hard work arranging a new flight. The reason for cancellation was something about 'airport scheduling' which seems poor when it's cancelled on the day. The flight I then got over 24 hours later left London late and arrived in Manila late. My return flight also departed Manila late and arrived in London significantly late - people were complaining they had missed transfers when we landed.

Flew Philippine Airlines from Manila to San Francisco, CA. The seats were small and cramped. The aisles were very narrow. They had placed 3 seats on next to window and 4 seats in the middle. There was a disorganized delay of loading the plane due to the number of elderly people requiring wheelchairs. In addition the ground crew insisted on loading passengers from just one side of their podium (even though they had enough employees to allow loading from both sides). Once on board there was a lack of overhead bins to accomodate everyone's carry on luggage. The food was awful. The breakfast that was served appeared to have powdered eggs and were very watery. The Longanisa was not cooked. Both dinner and breakfast were so awful that I only ate the bread and jam and also the dried Mangos from Cebu. The bathrooms always seemed to have a line of waiting passengers. The bathroom closest to our seats had a sink that would not drain. There was no razors, combs, or toothbrush and toothpaste as we had received on previous flights. The take-off was delayed as they had to offload 2 passengers who apparently felt ill after having boarded the plane and needed to be deplaned. The entertainment system had a very limited selection. In fact many of the same movies from the flight over (4 weeks prior) had the same selections.

Back then the Philippines was known as the smile of Asia, so your holiday should start when you get on the plane not when you get off. This was my first time to fly this airline in twenty years. The nightmare began at the check-in at Sydney, the max luggage for economy was 30kg and 7kg carry on, it was obvious that 95% of the passengers were Filipinos or expat Filipinos and part of their culture is to bring back as much as goods as they can to their loved ones back in their homeland. I was shocked to see amount of excess luggage that was being loaded both at the check in and online check in queues. So much that they needed a large cage that resembled something from a zoo, I would estimate somewhere between twenty to thirty kilos for at least half of the passengers, not to mention the excess carry on baggage. Twenty years ago the airline would serve you a snack and 2 hot meals an abundance of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, two movies, toothpaste & brush and padded eye shield for sleep on an eight hour flight. Today all you will get is a very small almost inedible hot meal, very little to drink, a cheese and ham toasted sandwich for a snack, no inflight entertainment. They do have free WiFi but that takes away the experience you should look forward to when travelling. So if you don't have your own tablet or smartphone, tough. The aircraft advertised was an A340 but I later found out it may have been a A330, standard 70 rows, somehow they managed to get 78 rows, Virtually no leg room, seats were small and cramped, the aisle way was very narrow, toilets very small, could not contact stewardesses as seat controls didn't seem to work.

Unfortunately, on the day of my return flight, there was a typhoon in Boracay Island. All flight services from Caticlan airport were cancelled for 2 days. There was no boat service to reach Caticlan from Boracay for 24 hours. So I had no option but to miss the night PAL flight to Sydney and try to reschedule it. The misery started when I tried to contact PAL customer service to reschedule my flight. It took me around 8 phone calls and 7 hours of effort to get my flight rescheduled. I kept on trying to convince them that it was not my fault, that I was missing the flight due to the typhoon, but they refused to accept this. I was dumbfounded when the lady on the other line stated the total cost of rebooking is approximately US$5620 as I got a promo offer previously.  They kept on hold for over 45 minutes and the line got disconnected. I tried to call then again at least 6-8 times and each time they kept me on hold for at least 45 minutes, repeatedly getting disconnected. They never even attempted to call me back for the first 6 hours. After 7 hours of struggling, I finally settled rescheduling the ticket for a penalty of US$819. The only redeeming feature of this airline is that the service in Business class was above average with reasonable food.

I paid A$780 (US$600/GBP 420) for a return flight from Sydney to London, so it would be churlish to complain about anything: at that price I was surprised they didn't make me work as an FA. It was around half what I'd expect to pay on most airlines, and 30-40% less than the cheapest alternative. Service on the LHR-MNL leg on April 21 was outstanding and food was better than expected. There were no seat-back inflight entertainment on any of the flights, it was possible to stream films from a central server to your phone or tablet using the MyPAL Player app, which had to be downloaded in advance. This worked very well, and contained maps as well as entertainment. However, it did not contain anything like the range of films shown on the Philippine Airlines website : there were no movies less than a year old, and there were only about 20-30 movies in total. iPads with more films were available on request on the MNL-LHR vv legs, but not on the Sydney legs, and they'd run out of iPads on the MNL-LHR leg. Transfers at Manila quick and easy. NAIA Terminal 2 isn't pretty, but security screening and processing were fast and efficient. Check-in at all three airports was fast and efficient. The A330 (SYD-MNL) was pretty new. Seating was 3-3-3. The A340s were all ex-Iberia, and were very old. Seating was 2-4-2, and was generous. On the A340s the drop down TV screens were all broken, one way or another. On the MNL-SYD, the screen towards the front of economy had completely lost vertical hold, so there was a spinning black-and-white-ish screen flashing for most of the flight. On all A340 flights, the music played on landing appeared to be from a tape player. While I am sure that some people enjoy piano covers of Nu-Metal hits from the early 2000s (a low-budget Richard Clayderman clone playing Linkin Park), the music was played on an old, stretched, twisted tape, and sounded so bad that people were openly laughing at it.

"""become a discount airline""",4,2016-04-25,Bangkok to Cebu City via Manila. I have mixed feelings about this flight based on the fact that it seems that Philippine Airlines is trying to become a discount airline at the same time that they want to appear to be a full service airline. Online booking is confusing at times because you cannot choose your special meal in anyway so forget it if you are a vegetarian (even when I telephoned the airline requesting this in Bangkok they told me I could not do it so had to bring my own sandwich on the flight). You cannot pay the extra fee online to get a premium economy seat or one of the forward seats but you can pay for them on the flight and upgrade which is very strange. It would make so much more sense to do this online. Check-in in Bangkok was done by contact employees with PAL staff observing. I was told that I did not need to pick up my bags in Manila but having done this route before I knew I needed to clear customs with the bags so it is a good thing I remembered. That needs to be corrected or some people will not get there luggage. The flight was delayed 45 minutes which was unfortunate and every time I have flown this flight it is delayed. The crew on the flight are very polite and highly trained. They do everything they can to try and make passengers comfortable including getting everyone to close the window screens after takeoff to cut down on the glare. This would make sense if they had in-seat TV but they do not. On any over 3 hour flight it is almost criminal to not have in-seat TV. I did talk to a staff on the flight who said she was from management and promised to check into some things and email me back for after 11 days I have not received anything. The wifi is as slow as it is in the Philippines and the My PAL player app barely works so forget downloading it. waste of time. Wifi in Terminal 2 is terrible - the PAL wifi is non-existent. you can connect but you are connected to nothing. Amazing that in 2016 they cannot provide decent wifi that works. The flight to Cebu City was delayed by 1.15 hrs. The flight was fine but they refused to give me a blanket and said it was policy not to give blankets in economy but the plane was freezing.

It wasn't spectacular, but far from horrible. I think that the new business class seat configuration is a huge step back though. For a business class seat, the seats are cramped, and I can't really call those seats comfy. Softer cushions would have made a world of difference. Also, the decision to give passengers iPad minis in lieu of seat back TV screens is a step backward in my opinion. I would prefer to have my hands free while relaxing on a flight.  The inflight entertainment selections were also limited. I didn't think I got my money's worth on these seats, other airlines offer better seats at comparable prices.

PAL urgently needs to decide what they are - full service or low cost!  The lack of inflight entertainment would be felt on medium to long haul flights.

The online booking process is good but you cannot pick a special meal online. This can only be done by special request on the telphone or in person at their office. Since Philippine Airlines never answers the telephone in Thailand and rarely answers it in the Philippines it is not something simple to do. The flight check in is done by airport staff not Philippine Airline staff but this was smooth and trouble free. Boarding was easy and they begin boarding about 40 minutes before departure so if you do not like sitting on a plane that is not moving stay in the lounge until the final call. Service on the flight was very good, staff were excellent and very attentive. I had to ask for a blanket 4 times from 3 different attendants and finally got one but they eventually ran out so other passengers were not able to have one and the plane was very cold. Food was about a 3 out of 10 but they did give ice cream at the end of the meal which was a nice touch. Seats are not very comfortable and the legroom is terrible for a person 5'10"" or larger. My knees were up quite high and then the passenger in front reclined his seat and I had to spread my legs just to fit in the seat. There was no in seat tv's which was very disappointing for a 3+ hour flight. I have taken this flight on Thai Airways and they have in seat tv. Arrival in Manila is confusing and terminal 2 is very old and should be replaced. If you are transferring to another flight you pass through immigration then wait for 30 minutes to get your bag, have customs sign your customs form and give it to the transfer desk. No one is there to explain this so you have to figure this out yourself. After passing your bag to the transfer staff you proceed to try and find the domestic terminal which is upstairs and then get to the gate for the flight to Cebu. The internet in the terminal is almost non-existent and very frustrating. There is only 1 washroom in the entire terminal. Seats are metal and very uncomfortable.

The flight experience was so-so no different from any other airline (and I've had my fair share of airlines). The plane was clean enough for its age. Space was adequate (I'm short though 5'2). My only pet peeve is the hidden charges and policies when it comes to excess baggage. Even if you pre-purchase excess baggage they find a way to charge you a bit for the extra weight. For example I bought two extra 30 kg (total 60 kg) excess baggage for MNL-DVO flight since I was in my home base of Guam. When I got to the check-in counter in MNL going to DVO they honored the first 30 kg pre-paid excess but not the second 30 kg excess. Why? Because apparently as per the PAL staff checking me in only one pre-paid excess baggage per person allowed. So why did the PAL in my home base allow me to purchase two prepaid excess baggage while PAL in MNL would not honor this purchase? I ended up paying for the excess baggage and no refunds for the 2ND prepaid baggage. The same happened for DVO-MNL. Got charged $100+ even though I had my prepaid baggage. This airline is very inconsistent. Their main goal really is to make money. You can see it from the start. They don't care about their guests.

Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2015-03-25,"I'm a frequent flyer with PAL so I will create three reviews under one contribution. (1) A321 Flights MNL-SIN- MNL: I usually go for the ""Choice Seats"" for these flights which cover two or three rows right behind Business Class. This section is lumped together with Business Class so you get extra privacy and are on the ""front"" of the cabin. This also means you get to share the lavatories in the Business Class section so no crowding whatsoever. No IFE in Regular Economy but if you stay in the Choice Seats section the FAs offer an iPad Mini provided there are spare units (it's standard issue to Business flyers) IFE is up to date and had nice choices of Hollywood films and TV shows; Food is fantastic usually the main reason I like flying PAL. (2) A340 Flights MNL-HNL-MNL: Economy seats are pretty standard these are the Iberia planes under lease so you even notice the markings/labels in Spanish. No AVOD which is a pity for an 11 hour flight; Food again is fantastic and service is quite nice. I flew Business on the HNL-MNL leg and seats were pretty good not a full recline but almost and it had a massage function which was excellent. AVOD was available but they also offered iPads - IFE content on the iPads were far better FA service was excellent the food tasted lovely and was a mix of Japanese/Filipino/Western options. Lounge access in HNL was via Delta SkyLounge - this was so-so. (3) A320 Flights SIN-MNL-SINL: this one's pretty standard; No AVOD but the IFE was tolerable with common monitors/screens IFE content was also fine and they played one full-length movie followed by two 20-minute TV shows; food again is pretty good and usually involves Chicken Fish or Beef; some A320 planes have a similar setup with the A321 for Choice Seats where they are located within the front section of the plane and separated from the rest of the Economy Class service is pretty good as well. Probably the factor where PAL beats its competition? The In-Flight Safety Video.",False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,7,2015-03-23,Flew MNL-CGK-MNL this March 2015. Flight was on a worn-out Airbus 320 with in-flight entertainment. Food was okay but I noticed that PAL has regressed with the quality compared the previous flights. Flights to and from Manila were both slightly delayed. Flight crew were nice courteous and attended to my requests.

Philippine Airlines customer review,9,2015-03-20,March 2015: LHR-MNL-LHR on A340. Despite the poor reviews on this site I experienced a quality level of service from PAL and felt compelled to write a glowing review. Yes the A340 is somewhat on the old side yes it is a bit worn in places but the seat was comfortable there was ample legroom it turned into a flat bed there was power and whilst I have had better inflight entertainment on other airlines there was enough choice and it was AVOD. But where PAL really excelled was in three areas. 1) Value for money 2) Inflight service 3) Meals. All in my opinion were better than you receive in Club World. At LHR you have access to the Etihad lounge we left on time PAL now flies over Russia and China so we arrived in MNL in 12.15 hours rather than the previous 14. On the return leg we left on time and with a journey time of 14 hours. Nothing was too much trouble for the crew. Would I fly with PAL again? Absolutely. Any grumbles? One - headphones were basic and not noise reducing - but that's it. Don't let the other reviews put you off flying with PAL in business on the London route.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,5,2015-03-20,I flew MNL-SYD on 6 March and SYD-MNL on 16 March. Economy class in both directions. Paid an extra US$50 for exit row seats which was worth the money. Flights left and arrived close to schedule. No entertainment options of any kind provided in economy class cabin which for an international flight of more than 7 hours appears to be out of step with other airlines.

Philippine Airlines customer review,,2015-03-04,"Flying return to Tagbilaran with a connection in Manila from Hong Kong. All flights were booked in one booking with Philippine airlines. Prior to leaving on our holiday we had our flight rescheduled 3 times. The final two times were not confirmed with us until after we contacted the airline staff several times asking for a confirmation email 1 day before departure. The final flight scheduled meant we left 1 day earlier and had to spend a night in a hotel in Manila not ideal. Our return journey had our flight from Tagbilaran to Manila cancelled after the departure time of 4.40pm (while we were sitting at the gate) because another airline had not yet taken off from the runway so the PAL flight we were meant to get didn't land and returned to Manila. Philippine airlines considers this ""Force Meajure"" (an act of god) and takes no responsibility informs it's customers the next flight would be at 7.05am the next day and that they would not pay for accommodation until then. We found cheap accommodation nearby for the night returned for our 7.05 am flight the next day which was delayed and departed at 7.30. We arrived in Manila and were expecting to be put on another flight (the original connection was missed because PAL failed to arrange for a flight to pick us up from Tagbilaran in time). Instead we were put on standby for a flight that morning that was overbooked then in the afternoon that was overbooked. All flights were full and no seats were available to myself and my partner. PAL staff continued to claim due to the ""act of god"" (not their poor quality service) they weren't responsible for paying for us to be transferred to another airline. The next non fully booked flight with PAL was not for 2 days and they also would not pay for accommodation or often compensation. Ultimately we took a taxi to another terminal (a much nicer terminal) and bought new tickets with Cebu-Pacific who were very helpful and got us home on time. Never fly Philippine Airlines. There staff were patronizing and unaccommodating their level of customer service was poor and their flights are constantly cancelled and rescheduled.",False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2015-02-24,"DAV-MNL-HKG By far the worst airline I have ever travelled with (and I have had my share). Three domestic flights with PAL on the same week all delayed over 2 hours including my flight out of Davao. Surprisingly my connection to Hong Kong was right on time so I missed it. The FAs tell you ""sorry about the delay but we got you here safe!"" They sent me to a hotel more than 1 hour far from the airport.

Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2015-02-18,Manila-Davao Dec 15. The price is the same as Cebu Pacific but PAL offers better service than the latter you are provided biscuits coffee and water on the flight and they leave on time. Was originally on the 4am flight but that got cancelled and passengers were moved to the next Davao flights luckily my friend and I were placed on the very next one (the 8.30 one). We were compensated with full meal breakfast while waiting for the flight. Our flight left on time and arrived in Davao according to schedule. The take-off and landing were superb and smooth. The flying experience is a great improvement the check-in counter and flight crew were professional. My only suggestion for PAL is to make seats more comfortable and to place personal built-in IFE on every seats at least on international flights if they want to compete with other international carriers. The iPad IFE doesn't look like a good idea especially at long haul ergonomically. Traditional seat-installed IFE is still the best way to go. As long as they don't have IFE on their international flights will still continue to take foreign carriers when I go abroad.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,2,2015-02-18,Business Class Melbourne-Manila-LHR. July 2014. The Lounge in MEL is one of the best lounges in Melbourne. The flight to Manila was excellent on all counts. No problem getting out of the airport. We found meter taxis are the best value and convenient. We stayed at the New World in Makati which we can recommend. The flight to England was the same experience and we were saying at that stage that PAL was really good value. Then it all went downhill on our return flights in September. PAL uses Malaysia Airlines Lounge in London and it was just okay. On the flight (late) my seat was broken and would not recline I was moved to another seat but the media unit didn't work so they gave me a Ipad. The seat headrest abutted the toilet and the constant flushing made sleep almost impossible. We were very glad to get to our hotel in Manila and get some sleep. The flight back to Melbourne from Manila was delayed for hours. Guess what! I had exactly the same experience on the flight to Melbourne broken seats and media units. I complained and was given 30000 Pal frequent flyer points as compensation.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,2,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,9,2015-02-12,This was a codeshare with Vietnam Airlines for the second leg from HCM to MAN was surprised at the level of high quality service previously I have been unimpressed with PAL on their short flights.

Philippine Airlines customer review,1,2015-02-06,I traveled on the 28th of Dec 2014 for a month LHR-MNL and back. It is such a shame that PAL is using an old A340-300 acquired from Iberia which is more or less 15 years old already. The aircraft does not have IFE built in on their seats they provide ipad mini's though but they have a very poor choice of entertainment system. The upholstery is totally worn out stained and the aircraft itself looks so dirty. PAL should do something about these problems as it is a shame to flying customers especially foreigners who wants to visit the Philippines. As a flag carrier they should improve their services because as what the saying goes first impression always lasts. Never again with PAL on a LHR-MNL flight unless they start using the 777-300er again!,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,6,2015-01-23,BKK-MNL Economy. I usually try and avoid PAL due to their poor reliability but it was the only flight I could get. Check-in in BKK was efficient and the flight left on time. The price was good and I think the competition from Cebu Pacific is doing this. Food was surprisingly good but there was no IFE on a 3hr+ flight. Cabin service was nothing special with the crew seeming oblivious to passengers cluttering up the aisles in order to chat to each other. Personally I prefer to spend the flight watching a movie or reading a book rather than having somebody's backside in my face. T2 arrivals in MNL was reasonably efficient.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,3,,True,

No apologies from carrier and no literature from carriers representatives at LHR that showed this clause. Seats were damaged and IFE did not work. Return flight two hours delay with no reason. Delay to LHR from main hub totally unacceptable. Carrier evidently does not realise it will lose its customers with service like this. SQ here we come next time.

Philippine Airlines customer review,2,2015-01-14,Philippine Airlines have a very long way to go if they are ever to be considered seriously on the long haul route from MNL to LHR. Seats are too narrow leg room is very limited. I have been flying Europe to Asia and back frequently since 2006 and they rank well below SQ EK BA KLM CG and Malaysia Airlines. Food is dreadful - poor quality tasteless lack of variety and on my flights to BKK SGN and BKK over the past 3 months they always run out of food choices. There is absolutely no reason why the cabin crew should not understand simple requests. It wasn't even a cheap ticket this time round.

When we arrived at the airport they said they had overbooked and wanted volunteers to take a flight two days later but with the compensation package of two rtn flight tickets. In the end 15 mins prior to departure they upgraded us to business class sounds nice and it was but surely they need to get their act together and not overbook a flight on 5th Jan 2015 one of the busiest days for returning.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2015-01-05,My flight was delayed by approximately 3 hours from Puerto Princesa to Manila International airport. The offered reason was due to traffic congestion in Manila. However while we waited Cebu Pacific and Air Asia both sent at least three flights to Manila International Airport. Employees were prompt to try to expedite my connection. However the flight was so delayed that I missed my connection and was forced to spend a night in Manila. The employees were able to arrange a hotel within an hour and to put me on a flight very early the next morning. However the hotel they arranged (Palm Plaza) was located approximately 1 hour away from the airport! Why would they choose this hotel when there are multiple hotels right across the street from the airport. Other points of note. When I arrived in Manila they forgot to put the connecting passengers checked-in baggage on the baggage claim which significantly delayed us. The planes used for domestic flights are extremely cramped. You will be very lucky to fit your knees into the seats.

Philippine Airlines customer review,6,2014-12-31,Average domestic flight with this airline. Snack offerings are chips but the peanuts disappeared and a rather limited choice of drinks (water tea or coffee). If you wanted more you could buy from their buy-on-board menu which was rather limited. The overhead screens that you usually see on PAL's A320s have disappeared too.

Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2014-12-10,MNL-KIX-MNL. I was pleasantly surprised. It was my first trip on them and I would fly them again. For starters my ticket was very inexpensive so that is always a plus. It was actually less expensive on Philippine Air than some of the other local budget carries and I got to check a bag for free. Departed Manila on time and arrived in Osaka about 35 minutes ahead of schedule. Meal was Japanese Curry Beef which was tasty and the mango jelly that came with it was delicious. The one disappointing thing is only one drink service but they did give me the entire can of soda so can't complain about that. During my stay in Osaka I got the news of typhoon heading towards the Philippines so I decided to change the ticket last minute to get back earlier and the change fee was only 100 USD which in this day and age is amazing. There was also no increase in fare. The crew on the flight home did a really commendable job as the circumstances they were dealing with could have been trying. I have never been on a flight where the seat belt sign was on almost the entire time it was 4 hours of bumps turbulence and grabbing the seat handles but the crew despite being interrupted 3 times and having to return to their seats were able to complete their meal service clean up and duty free. I had the pork dish which wasn't bad and the fruit platter was refreshing and quite good. I am a big fan of their inflight entertainment concept - they don't have the usual movie screens (at least not on the A330) but instead you can stream from their library right into your tablet laptop or MAC however their library left a lot to be desired. I really think their system is the new way to go but they need to improve the selection of films. They also offer in flight WiFi but I did not use. I'm not sure what their selection is like on their long haul flights but they could upgrade to some more modern movies on the short international routes. They're not the best airline in Asia I've flown but they're not that far behind either. The food was good service good and planes clean. The inflight entertainment concept is cool but needs improvement. I would definitely fly them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,5,,True,

Tight seats no seatback entertainment but plane is equipped with streaming videos which you were supposed to be able to stream to your wireless devices after downloading an app (which we did not do). Since I pack my iPad with movies it really wasn't an issue for me. Seats were a bit cramped. FAs were friendly and helpful especially in trying to sort out the streaming issue. Food was good considering. Delayed out of the gate because of an interlock issue with the doors but arrived BKK on time. Inbound MNL in J class. Same if not friendlier service from FAs. Seat was a recliner with a personal video screen with an OK selection of entertainment options. Food was pretty good and the drinks were always refilled. Haagen Dazs ice cream for dessert was a nice touch. While I loathe taking domestic PAL flights they more than make up for it in their international ones.

A340-300 both ways. 2 hours late laving Heathrow but we arrived in Manila on time. The flight was only about 65% full and my son and I were lucky as we had all 4 seats in the middle section to ourselves. Seat recline seemed limited. The A340 is clearly an older plane - no seat back videos but passengers are issued with iPads for the duration of the flight which are pre- loaded with games and films. The staff were friendly and helpful. The catering was fine - 2 full meals and a snack. Getting to Manila non stop is a real selling point for PAL. Return - big plus point is that PAL uses Terminal 2 at NAIA which is a dream compared to Terminal 1. Again half empty flight and I had 4 seats to myself! Again 2 meals and a snack. Staff were good no complaints. I was a bit wary before I travelled as I had read some poor reviews of the PAL flight from London and I had always used Emirates / Cathay / Singapore / Thai before. The lack of seatback videos is solved by the iPads. The staff didn't come round with water that much. So long as the price is right I would certainly use PAL again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True,

Arrived well ahead of time in the airport and bags drop off was a breeze given that it was a small plane - they use a Q4000. Bags was over weight but the fee was reasonable upon hearing that I have an onward flight they made sure my bags get to the destination and tagged as priority. Flight was slightly delayed due to bad weather in TAC. Boarding was swift and organized and cabin info was adequate. Snacks were served which is nothing to write home about but its the little things that count. Most other airline with the same fare don't even serve snacks. Flight was smooth and bags came out first.

Philippine Airlines customer review,4,2014-10-20,I'm a Mabuhay Elite member and fly around 30000 miles a year on PAL. Most often I fly Tokyo - Manila and Manila - General Santos City but have also flown on PAL from Manila - London and Manila - Bali. Sometimes I fly Economy and sometimes Business. Yesterday (October 12) I flew Business in PR432 Manila - Tokyo NRT. The plane is an A330-300 with 3-3-3 seating in Economy and Premium Economy and 2-2-2 seating in Business. The IFE is wireless and video choices are very limited (Ice Age and Avatar). You would not want to be in either Economy or Premium Economy if the flight was full. The seats are very narrow and if you are of average body width you will be pressing shoulders hard with the person sitting next to you. Business Class uses PAL's new herringbone seating which is the worst Business Class seating I have experienced in recent times. The seats are narrow the herringbone layout means you are angled towards the person next to you and so is he/she angled towards you. You will not want to work on anything confidential because he/she can easily read your notebook screen. The layout would be great for romantic couples who want to be close to each during the flight but for business-people? The flight attendants do an excellent job and both food and wine are very good but 2-2-2 seating in a modern A340 is unacceptable compared to the 1-2-1 many airlines use in A330s and A340s. PAL used to fly 777s on the Manila - Tokyo route and that was a very enjoyable experience both in Business and in Economy which again indicates that PAL's fleet modernization has everything to do with reducing fuel costs but nothing to do with passenger comfort. I am dreading being in a PAL A340 to London next month.,False,,,Business Class,,,2,5,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,9,2014-10-13,Flight was an Etihad codeshare from Dammam to TAC although PAL operated the MNL to TAC sector check in was a breeze since I was already checked from Abu Dhabi still the counter staff were very friendly and accommodating and very informative since the flight will be on a Bombardier Q400 due to operational restrictions in Tacloban airport meaning luggage weights were restricted. Staff explained the issue and possible solution airport utilized was the new T3 terminal and it was well marked. Boarding was a breeze though we were bussed to the aircraft- boarding was organized. The aircraft itself was small the seats were a 2-2 configuration but very comfortable and had wide legroom take off was slightly delayed due to congestion but it was smooth. Snacks served were adequate for an hours flight minimal cockpit info and the attendants were efficient landing was a but bumpy due to slightly windy weather. Bags were out in less than 10 minutes.

Philippine Airlines customer review,6,2014-09-14,HK-Manila return. Outbound new A330 business seats in reverse herringbone configuration. Fully flat seats however seats are quite narrow. IFE provided by ipad which is quite inconvenient having to hold or stare down when placed in table top. Tried their premium economy seats quite surprising it had very good legroom and recline. Could compete with narrow-body plane's business class if only they had IFE. Inbound on an old A340 Tears are all over the seams of the seats no IFE. Musty smell all over. Redeeming factor is the seat pitch. Really needs to be decommissioned as it is a disgrace to PAL's fleet. Food in both sector fair but not great.

Unfortunately the portion was too little and there was no appetizer salad such example but the dessert was very nice. The drink selection was great. All in all the quality of the food was very good. My seat was spacious enough although I'm tall. The flight attendants were cheerful and friendly and they were always ready for a smile. The toilets were clean and spacious. There was no IFE but for almost 2 hours flight it was not important in my opinion. Newspapers were distributed. The flight departed on time and arrived on time.

Philippine Airlines customer review,6,2014-09-01,I flew from Manila to Heathrow on a 777 my return was on an old Airbus A340. To say the airbus was substandard would be an understatement in an age of carriers using modern up to date planes this was a great disappointment. London is a prime capital city. To look to increase passengers especially from the west you really have to up your game. There is no personal screen (the replacement was a small iPad to use which meant holding it while viewing it not easy hour after hour on a long haul flight) my fold down table was broken the seat was really uncomfortable the toilets were not kept clean.

PAL changed the plane to the very cramped A330 with no business class available. Wish they had told me in advance so I could have bought a business ticket with Thai. At the counter they gave me 150 usd credit per ticket which in no way covers the fare difference I had paid. They said even with Premium Economy seats they would give Business service. Not true at all. Seats are a nightmare food was horrible and I got a cranky face when I asked for a drink refill.

The airplane didn't land smoothly we found out later on there was something wrong with the aircraft. We were in our seats just waiting for our flight to Toronto while the pilot announced we were going to have a short delay of 2 hours. They served us a meal. An hour after a meal they announced again that we should leave the airplane with all our hand carry luggage. We were kept in a small part of airport. 5 hour delay by that time. Told the delay would be 7 hours by this time. It was around 7pm. We supposed to be in Toronto by 9.30 pm. We went to the baggage claim and waited an hour for our things. Then they made us line up for food vouchers for almost 2 hours. Given 15$ each. 12.30 we were lined up to check our luggage in again. The line was pretty long and it moved so slowly.

Philippine Airlines customer review,1,2014-08-20,I am a regular business class traveler on the London - Manila sector and was happy that Philippine Airlines introduced a direct flight from London to Manila. Travelled on the London - Manila - London sectors several times from early December 2013 and was generally happy with the 777 comfort. However my recent journey from Manila to London was terrible. Evidently Philippine Airlines started using 15 year old A340 planes on the route in early August that appears to be part of the problem - slower plane takes 1.5 hours longer than the 777 now only 2 hours faster than quality Middle Eastern carriers very poor seats no full pull down separators between adjacent seats no current affairs or news programs on the in-seat media system - understand the programs are only changed every 2 months only 3 small toilets for business class with old scoured and discoloured wash basins. Very basic food compared to alternative carriers. Philippine Airlines are selling upgrades from economy to business at the airport for $500 which is then $500 less than a business ticket purchased online. Advised that only 14 business class seat had been sold but business was full - presumably passengers took the $500 check in upgrade. Philippine Airlines need to decide whether it wants to be a budget or premium player in the airline business.

Philippine Airlines customer review,1,2014-08-15,"I flew from SFO-MNL-SFO only because of the direct flight schedule. I've flown most of the airlines in the Star Alliance Sky Team and OneWorld and it is with extreme disappointment to say that PAL does not come close to the level of any of the airlines in these groups. PAL fare is significantly higher being on schedule is an issue (I can't believe that the one time I had to fly PAL both inbound and outbound flights were delayed! On the inbound flight the pilot says after passengers are boarded ""we have a mechanical failure your safety is our concern so we will be delayed on take off for at least an hour"". The flight attendants have an attitude - they see you struggling with your luggage and stare at you. I asked an FA for water she looked annoyed that I asked her for something and to top it off she never came back with the water. They must be cutting back on food (considering how much more expensive they are compared to other airlines) - by the middle row there were no choices left - you just have to take what they give you!",False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,,1,,False,

What made a difference is how the airline immediately accepted my sister's medical equipment even though it is a bit overweight.

Philippine Airlines customer review,1,2014-08-08,We decided to fork out the money for business class because one of us has a medical problem so needs leg room. What a waste of money. The seats were angled downwards so you are continuously sliding down your seat. Very uncomfortable to sleep. Seats are very close together (old airplane) so if you are seated next to a stranger be prepared to climb over someone or have them climb over you. Food options ran out (and we were seated in the front section) so we could not get the food we wanted. The inflight entertainment was outdated no new movies! Also one of our screens (we were a family of 4 traveling) was not working. 3 out of our 4 reading lights were not working. The business class lounge of Philippine Airlines is a joke. Not a lot of food options and insufficient quantities. The lounge in San Francisco looks worse than an outdated dentist office and the hot food was placed out on the counter (no cover at all). Of course it was cold within minutes. Anything that ran out was just that: finished. Nothing was replenished. So once people got that the food ran out even faster. Same for the few cans of juice in the fridge. But the worst part really was the business class cabin. It is like going back in time 20 years. The arm rest of my seat was completely ripped. On the way from Manila to SFO they did not have the business class packs (with the socks etc) so we received the economy class bags. Not a good look at all! On both trips the food ran out according to the staff they simply do not get enough to stock their kitchens with. For breakfast it was oriental fare only - no Western choices at all. The staff are continuously apologizing and they seem genuinely uncomfortable. The reading lights for instance were reported by them countless times. And then nothing happens.

Philippine Airlines customer review,,2014-07-27,In April this year by boyfriend and I flew Philippine Airlines and without a doubt the worst most disorganised airline I've ever traveled with. First the flights were rescheduled to nearly 4 hours earlier than originally planned and we were not notified no email no call nothing. I only found out because I checked the airport flight times to see what gate we would have to board from. My boyfriend and I were both travelling on connecting flights which meant we would not make our new flight times. We had to rearrange our connecting flights and fork out a lot of money to change these. Secondly online states that everyone will have ipads to watch TV/movies on. No this was not the case either. There were 3 TV's in our section of they plane and I'm not talking out 3 TV's per row I'm talking about 3 TV's for the entire section. Also these TV's were not made in the 2000's they were at least 20+ years old. I felt like I was watching a video rather than a DVD or anything of quality.

Philippine Airlines customer review,10,2014-07-27,Very good experience over all. Being married to a Filipino we find travel by PAL the most convenient. On trips from Toronto to Manila and back there is a short stop in Vancouver and back on the same plane. Flight attendants stewardesses and all others were friendly and helpful. On arrival to Vancouver my wife and I were moved to business class for the remainder of the trip to Manila free of charge. All in all a really good travel experience. My one complaint if I could think of any would be the food although that would be very nit picking of me. I'm not a big fan of Filipino foods though the ones they served I'm sure were prepared well. My wife enjoyed what they served as well as I'm sure 99% of the other people on board. My opinion on food should not be important here perhaps because most who fly this airline will love the food.

Philippine Airlines customer review,9,2014-07-06,I am a regular business cabin flier usually clocking up between 4 and 5 long haul flights a month. I flew Philippine airlines Jakarta to Manila and Manila to London on July 5 2014. The latter leg is a 14.5 hour flight. Having read some of the reviews on this site I was an exceptionally reluctant flier and in fact protested belatedly at the choice of airline. I will be apologising to my agent for my complaints. The service on the flight was exceptional staff were professional courteous and always helpful in spite of some difficult requests (I chose to anticipate change in time zones by sleeping and eating at all the wrong times). The food was great wine was good cabin and toilets spotless. Although the seats don't recline all the way it is flat bed at a slight angle and perfectly acceptable for sleeping. They have a relatively sparse choice of inflight movies and shows only somewhat compensated for with loan iPads for the flight with additional choices so if are a big consumer of inflight entertainment it may be worth bringing your own especially given the length of the flight. Both flights were on time transfer at Manila faultless if surprisingly personal (escort for most of it) - this in spite of only a 1hour 10 minute layover. Check-in at Jakarta is through a dedicated business class channel which includes immigration. In all a great experience. I realise two flights don't make a big sample but I am happy to recommend until I experience differently.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,True,

It was originally at 14.15 arriving at 16.45 perfect for our connecting flight at 20.45 so we have time to clear immigration and re-check in. Then it was changed to 15.40 arriving in Bangkok at 18.10 which is just about OK for our 20.45 flight bearing in mind we must clear immigration as it's a different unlinked airline booking. Then today the day before I go online to check in (a good job I have) and our flight has been changed to 17.50 arriving in Bangkok at 20.20 which is impossible for our connecting flight. The best PAL have offered is a 'free' change to the 09.35 flight arriving in Bangkok at 12.05. We now lose half a day in Manila and we had planned to do our souvenir shopping then and we now have 8.5 hours at BKK airport. Yes we could go into BKK but we've visited BKK many many times before (we only live in Laos an hour away). I am not impressed.

Philippine Airlines customer review,5,2014-04-16,I came back from Manila on March 31 2014 on flight to LAX. As I boarded in NAIA on March 31 2014 the first attendant did not make any courteous comments whatsoever. Her response was rude but I tolerated it because I chose to fly cheap. PAL's Business Class is around $4.000 cheaper than Cathay Pacific and PAL flies direct. Service was not bad and all facilities were working. On our previous LAX-MNL flight the reading light above me wouldn't switch off and like other reviewers have said nothing was done about it. On this leg we paid the $50 for extra leg room in economy and ended up behind the main door with the big hump thereby preventing me from extending my leg forward. We can fly CP or JAL or SA and pay a lot more plus spend more time in the air and on layovers or we can just pay PAL their cheap fares and hope that the next PAL plane we board is newer.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,3,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,10,2014-04-14,LHR-MNL-LHR. I had to fly to MNL for an emergency. I couldn't get any flight on the usual airlines I fly with specifically Star Alliance member airlines or Emirates. A PAL flight suited my schedule so I booked a flight with them. I was not sure of PAL when I did the booking as it is fairly new to the London market though it is the only airline that offers a direct flight to between LHR and MNL. The day of the flight came. I did a web check in with no frills. When I got to the airport (LHR T4) the longest queue of passengers waiting to check in got my attention: all PAL passengers on the same flight I was about to be in. Luckily I checked in online so I did not have to wait for hours. PAL does not have its own ground staff hence was outsourced with DNATA which Emirates owns. When I got onboard very friendly FAs assisted me and changed my mood. Service really is great may be the same as Singapore Airlines' service. Food is average had 3 services all throughout the flight. Inflight entertainment is good though as not extensive as Emirates' ICE. No complimentary toiletries in flight unlike Asiana. Seats are wider and comfortable unlike seats on Singapore Air's A380s. On my way back to London I am impressed with the service at Centennial Terminal that PAL exclusively uses compared to Terminal 1 which is stressful. The flight was the longest flight i have ever been into - 15 hours. The service was great. In total PAL LHR flight is good value for money and will fly again with them. Hopefully PAL will have its own ground staff at LHR as DNATA staff do not care and gives bad impression on PAL.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2014-04-10,3/8/14 we were denied to board our flight from Basco to Manila due to the strong winds. 10 passengers were bumped off including us.

At BKK priority Immigration and lounge pass given direct down to THAI Business Lounge D. Far better lounge than the SATS that PAL uses at Changi. Onboard seated beverage requests taken asked for Champagne. 5 min later told they have ran out of Champagne. I ask how is this possible when we are still firmly at the gate. Purser explains PAL is not allowed to restock anywhere other than at home base in Manila. Since Feb 1st they are allowed to load only 2 bottles for Business class for 2 sectors. This A340 had 24 Business class seats 13pax. Outbound had 19 pax and all Champagne was consumed. Purser visibly frustrated by this policy but powerless. Same policy applies even to long-haul flights. Equally Economy is now limited to 120 cans of beer. Running out of Premium Class service items even before departure is ridiculous. This is regrettable because food was good and portions adequate and PAL Cabins Staff in Business is very friendly courteous and attentive. Seating was also comfortable as this was their long-haul A340 (Crew rest area in front Galley). Departure was delayed by about 20min arrival almost on time.

Seat was an old style recliner seat with a pitch comparable to economy class of other carriers. Seat reclines for about 2 inches and does not have any leg rest making it the most uncomfortable during a 7.5-hour journey. Entertainment is very poor no noise cancellation headphones and no amenity kits were given despite being advertised in the website. Service was attentive but food was very standard.

So much easier to make one connection in YYZ rather than having to make 2 connections. Staff were good plane was very good. I paid the $20 for premium economy. Was a newer Boeing 777-300ER with a fair bit of room. (Pro tip: Sit on one of the sides not the middle section.) The warm cloths towards the end of the trip are a nice touch as I usually only get those when I fly in Business Class. Only complaint was not enforcing carry-on restrictions which can get out of hand. Ample baggage allowances. Terminal 2 is better than Terminal 1 but not as good as Terminal 3 IMHO but it's good enough and certainly not the fault of the airline. Immigration and Baggage was probably about an hour but again not the fault of the airline.

I do not know why people complain about their lie flat beds they are comfortable. The new business class lounge in Manila is a huge improvement and is very welcoming airside.

We arrived to Manila airport 3 hours before our flight after traveling 2 hours from our resort. The business class lounge had no vegan or vegetarian food. We walked all the airport food concessions. Not one had any vegetarian food. Then we boarded our flight. The business class stewardess asked us for meal choices and when we said we had requested vegan meals she looked surprised. The Catering manager and his assistant came on board to speak to us to tell us to take the next day flight and the airline would have a meal for us.

I thought overall the food selection was very good. Nicely presented and well garnished. Seats were comfortable with almost full flat. Was able to sleep and I am a fairly large man. Although the on demand entertainment system worked well I found the selection a little small and the movies somewhat aged The 3.5 hour flight from MNL-BKK was on an A340 that was showing some age. After take off we found the entertainment system did not work. Seems it was ok in economy but Business was not. The FA returned shortly with a stack of I Pads and gave them out.

Philippine Airlines customer review,,2014-01-10,I booked 2 domestic return flights Manila-Caticlan/Boracay-Manila and Manila-Busuanga/Coron-Manila. The first one that was also their first flight to Caticlan in the early morning was incredibly delayed whereas their bigger competitor was continuing to announce boarding and boarding to Caticlan/Boracay and to various other domestic destinations. My second flight (from Caticlan to Manila on 2nd January 2014 morning) was also delayed but not too big a delay. My third flight from Manila to Busanga on 2nd January 2014 (afternoon) was cancelled. My fourth flight from Busuanga to Manila on 6th January 2014 (afternoon) was cancelled as the third one. Canceling the above mentioned flights meant one extra night in Manila and one extra night in Coron Town (both paid by Philippine Airlines including return transfers and very small meals both for Dinner and Breakfast). Based on what I experienced directly i.e. my same (afternoon) flight from MNL to Busuanga was canceled also on 1st January 2014 on 6th January both flights from Busuanga to Manila were canceled it seems that at least during the first week of 2014 the route Manila/Busuanga-Manila was operated by Philippine Airlines/PAL express on a Best Effort way so beware!

Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2014-01-03,Business Class from Manila to Tokyo and the only issue I had was their inflight meal portion size. There were two options of either Chicken or Fish I decided to have the fish and the portion size was ridiculous for a business class meal. I am no way a big eater but for a business class flight this should be looked at. The 2 pieces of fish were smaller than a matchbox with only 2 string beans and 2 roast potato balls. I have flown with Singapore Airlines and their business class meal portion size is worthwhile. The solution was - I had mentioned this to the inflight crew and they had offered me another meal which was nice of them to do so and they said they would report this to the catering department. Bottom Line: The overall service for PHP Airlines business class is good and staff are friendly. I enjoyed the experience and would fly with them again but I strongly suggest that the portion size for the business class meals are looked at and adjusted to a suitable size that's worth the fare paid. The overall experience was very good and the service was above average.,False,,,Business Class,,,5,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,True,

Philippine Airlines customer review,1,2013-12-09,BKK-Manila-SFO. There is no web check-in. We waited in line for 2 hours in BKK to check in and check bags. We spoke with airline after booking and prepaid for preferred economy seat (bulkhead 31 A and C) when I checked the flight status before leaving for the airport it would not let me check in but it did show our correct seat assignments. After the 2 hour check in process the check in woman handed us boarding passes with different seats. Told that we needed to go upstairs to their airline office and find out about the payment status. We had less than 45 minutes to clear immigration and security before boarding so we ran up. They then informed us that Philippine airlines does not take credit cards over the phone so we could not have prepaid we had to run down to a money exchange to exchange Thai Baht and then go back to the check in counter. I have never encountered a more disorganized and unfriendly airline. We arrived into Manila and it only got worse. We were ushered into a dirty holding area after presenting our boarding passes at the transit desk and then us and a small group of people traveling to SFO were walked into our terminal where our next flight would depart in 4 hours. We then realized that we were completely trapped for 4 hours between 6-10.30pm in a terminal with no food other than a disgusting hot dog stand that only accepted Philippine quezos. It was awful and so dirty. I was told that a request for a vegetarian meal on the flight could only be done in person 4 hours prior to the flight. As soon as I realized the situation I walked up to make my request. They then told me that could only be done 72 hours before! But it cannot be done online because nothing can with this airline. The plane had very narrow seats and was an old 747. I asked the flight attendant about the meal situation. She said she would check and left me with an empty tray with a roll and cup and never returned with anything or an explanation.

I mostly fly with them domestically and never had a problem in check in so far no delays and meals satisfactory for short and mid haul flights probably better the most. T2 is fine. it is well priced and a value for money compared to other airlines especially on mid haul and long. Plus who can beat the baggage allowance.

The service was very good and the food choices also very good. The return flight was on the 16th November. Check in again very easy. The flight itself was a day flight on a A440 the plane itself although a bit old was ok. The seats were larger than economy but still comfortable but again the footrest would not come up resulting in swollen feet again. However the service was absolutely first class as was the food so this made it worthwhile.

It needs to add an APP to make it easier for the busy traveller to use his smart phone to check in not just to use it as a boarding ticket. The staff also needs to understand web check in as the three terminals I used (Vancouver Manila and General Santos) had web check in lines but were not used. In Vancouver I lined up in the web check in line only to be told to go to the long regular line. The A340 long haul aircraft needs to be outfitted with an entertainment system for every seat like most world class airlines. Their recently acquired 777's have it which makes the long flights over the pacific more tolerable. Staff are exemplary always showing the level of service which put North American carriers to shame. Overall I would give them 3 stars out of 5 easily able to go higher with a few touch ups in their online system and aircraft entertainment systems.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,9,2013-10-20,Flew SIN-MNL-SIN. SIN-MNL flight was a 777. New plane great service but I think the movies in the inflight entertainment were the same as last May's.

Philippine Airlines customer review,9,2013-10-15,I was rescheduled to an earlier flight which is PR880. I was surprised to experienced their new A321. Flight PR880 was on time departing 7.45pm from Cebu to Manila. The flight attendants are all up beat and friendly. The inflight snacks was a biscuit and peanuts only. The seat in economy was fine for a short trip. The seat reclines a little and the seat slides forward. What I liked is the attentiveness of the cabin crews. After 50 minutes in the air we landed smoothly and on-time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,,,5,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2013-10-09,KTM to BKK. It is good and like others mentioned here the plane was quite old and there's no inflight entertainment. The website must be upgraded as there is no way to book online. However its worth travelling.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,7,2013-10-07,MNL-BKK-MNL in business class. The business class lounge at the international PAL terminal has been totally refurbished compared to the one I saw in November 2012. Its modern clean comfortable the food and drinks selection is good. En route to Bangkok by coincidence we have been embarked into an A321 maiden flight. Being a 3.5 hrs trip and a day flight comfort is not as important as for the long haul ones. However the seating was narrow without any leg rest no power sockets and no inflight entertainment which is awkward for a brand new plane of latest generation. After we took off we have been given iPads which did the job with a wide selection of movies and inflight electronic entertainment. On the way back I have been boarded into an A340 former Iberia but the experience in this case was excellent compared to the outbound route. Lie flatbed powered seats inflight entertainment (although the selection was limited to just one movie) and good service onboard. Must throw a huge commend for the attendants fantastic attentive professional all of them. Concluding for mid-short flight the experience its ok. Considering that the airline came out from tough times in the recent past it is fair to say that they did a good recovery job but from a passenger point of view there is certainly room for improvement except for the cabin crew which clearly stand out compared to most other competitors even if big names.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,3,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2013-10-07,Our plane was downgraded from a 747 to a A340. That is the most ridiculous thing I have heard of when travelling on a long-haul international flight. Why on earth would Philippine Airlines downgrade a plane that is travelling from Manila to SFO knowing that there are hundreds of passengers on this long-haul flight? The supposed reason from the supervisor was that the 747 was under maintenance and there wasn't a back-up plane for them to use. That is ridiculous that Philippine Airlines doesn't have a back-up 747 for a long-haul flight. Because of this we spent 2 hours waiting at the check-in counter until 3 seats became available for my party (and this was accomplished by compensating passengers willing to give up their seat). Once we were on our flight the flight attendants did not clean the bathrooms at all. When you have 260+ passengers on a plane using 6 bathrooms they need to get cleaned regularly. Additionally this downgraded plane did not provide personal entertainment systems. Having personal entertainment systems should be a requirement for a long haul international flight. The only good thing about this experience was how patient the check-in associate was with us and the fact that she was able to get 3 seats open for us.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2013-09-26,MLA to DGTE in June. Flight ended up being cancelled after 7 hours of waiting due to various unrecognizable reasons. We were already taxiing to the runway when the pilot decided to cancel the flight. Came back this month (September) and bought again a return ticket for MLA-DGTE-MLA. The outgoing flight went well although with the usual delay (2 hours) but on my return I decided to get an earlier flight from another airline because a day before the return trip I have been monitoring the airline's reliability and they were way off their declared schedules. Fearing I'd miss my international flight later that night I took the noon flight on another airline placing my afternoon flight with Air Philippines as backup. The other airline got me on time for my international flight and a phone call from my sister confirmed that I wouldn't have made it had I took Air Philippines as they arrived and left DGTE late again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,False,

Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2013-09-08,Flew B777-300er to Canada. Delayed 1 hour due to some technical problems and miscommunications between ground staff. The cabin was pleasantly relaxing generous legroom with inflight entertainment monitors each seat offering lots of good movies games and music.

Philippine Airlines customer review,3,2013-08-19,July 2013 we flew CGK-MNL-CGK. Used credit card to purchase tickets online through official PAL website when we checked-in we were not asked to show the credit card used to purchase ticket. During the flight hot meal was a choice of chicken or beef (CGK-MNL). Also a piece of bread on the tray but no butter. No wet towels provided. Also flew MNL-LAO-MNL and MNL-CEB-MNL on PAL not one departed on time (weather good no typhoon). Bought domestic tickets online (separately) didn't notice that baggage allowance could be different for the trip to LAO and CEB (10 kg & 20 kg respectively). Found out later that baggage allowance for domestic flights depends on the price you pay for the ticket but no such information before you click purchase. Since PAL is a full-service airline I think baggage allowance should be 20kg for economy class at whatever price you pay.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,True,

Philippine Airlines customer review,2,2013-07-24,HKG-MNL-LAX (JUL 12 2013). Flight from MNL to LAX was delayed 4 hours. Old and worn out plane for both flights. No personal entertainment screen which is terrible considering it's a 13 hour flight. Food is OK but the portions are way too small. The only thing that could have redeemed this airline was if their cabin crews are friendly and hospitable enough - but they aren't. There were Malaysian passengers who were requesting the vegetarian meal but they did not request it online / before the flight. Ideally an airline should be prepared for such situations. It was very disappointing how the cabin crew handled such thing. Makes me wonder what kind of training they undergo. They should learn a lot from Singapore airlines crew. PAL crews will serve food then disappear and reappear again when the next meal is to be served. Again learn from Singapore airlines.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,False,

Only movie screen was on bulkhead. No seatback video. Food was small portions for 17 hr flight with stop in GUM for fuel. Flt Attnd's very friendly. Some value for ticket but not enough to make me want to fly PAL again. Return trip to LAX was A340. Again very worn and not new by any standard. No video or entertainment of any kind - was broken. After meal service apx 2 hrs after take off flt attnds disappeared and occasionally would see one walking from front to back quickly.

Philippine Airlines customer review,10,2013-07-10,I flew round trip from San Francisco to Manila in Mabuhay (business) class in January 2013. There is no first class on the planes. The Mabuhay Lounge at SFO offered a superb light dinner. Business class was only half full. I had no one sitting next to me. Flight attendants addressed me formally by name and went out of their way to provide my requested food and beverages. Although the seat did not fully recline the seat plus the superb leg rest gave me enough room to curl up and sleep well. On the return which I had to make ahead of my schedule for personal reasons there was only one Mabuhay class seat available on the main deck of the 747 and the check-in agent obtained permission from the supervisor to assign it to me. The food in the Manila Mabuhay Lounge was superb-enough variety for a delicious complete dinner. My seat was in the first row of the plane which meant that I could place my carry-on in a closet in front of my seat rather than in an inconvenient overhead bin. I had the aisle seat but the person in the window seat had enough room to walk around the front of my seat and I was not disturbed during my sleep. Once again I was addressed by the crew by my title and surname and the food and beverage selection and service were superb. The outbound flight was two hours early as the light load enabled it to skip refuelling in Guam. The return flight was on time.,False,,,Business Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,

Positives: Very friendly staff Prompt service of meals and snacks Some extras - toothbrush toothpaste morning face towel Fun amusing safety video Clean Individual video screens. Touch screen. Negatives: Middle of the night snacking - they turn the lights on thereby ""forcing"" everyone to wake up to eat the snack. In flight entertainment of movies does allow you to select the latest movies among the rest of the movie selections. During the duty free shopping time FAs were very noisy and in our section there were 6-7 of them. They were passing items over the heads of passengers. It was very noisy and invasive of passenger space and peace. Tons of babies on the flight. Very noisy. When passengers were seated you still have lots of seat transfers because they have this policy of charging people $50 or $20 if you wanted to move to economy plus or to an exit row.

We were provided with a 75 HK$ meal voucher at check-in. On board the seat pitch is very good and the crew were courteous and professional. Planes are quite dated but fine. The return flight was only 20 minutes late and the meal was delicious. It was one of the tastiest meals I've had on about 300 flights over the last 15 years.

Philippine Airlines customer review,4,2013-06-09,PR512 SIN-MNL. After a rather lacklustre MNL-SIN leg (an early morning flight marred by dismal FA service and attitude) I was optimistic that the outbound leg was merely a fluke. Check in at Changi and the ground staff messed up seat assignments (I traveled with 3 children and we were separated on the flight - good thing we were able to switch with a friendly lady so we can sit together). Flight delayed an hour out of Singapore and FA attitude was exactly the same as our outbound flight. Service was hurried cold and distant. Food was inedible.

The food quality falls below the standard for international airlines there were no snacks served in between meals. Flight duration between Toronto to Vancouver was 4 hours and from Vancouver to Manila 12 hrs. At check in we were asked to pay $20 per person to get a better economy seat even though we paid $4200 for the ticket.

It is impossible to get from Boracay island to Kalibo by that hour. CS agent and supervisor were insisting we either take the 6.30am May 20 flight or do a ""go-show"" for their 8pm or 10pm or 12.15am flights.

Philippine Airlines customer review,5,2013-05-19,Flew PR 511 MNL-SIN on 19 May 2013 in coach. PAL doesn't have online check in for international flights. Fortunately flight was fairly empty and an early morning flight and check in meant that the airport was not as crowded as usual. Painless going through check in with a full compliment of baggage from the family (wife and 3 kids). Immigration and security was a breeze. Because of the few number of passengers on this 6am flight boarding was easy. In fact the plane was fully loaded a good 20 mins before scheduled push back from the terminal. The good part of the flight ended there. I knew beforehand that there was no personal entertainment on PAL's A330 so I loaded the kids' gadgets with entertainment to keep them occupied for the 3 plus hour flight (an eternity in kids' clocks). What ruined the flight for me was the FAs attitudes of just going through the motions of completing the cabin service. It was rushed and no effort was made to accommodate passengers' requests. My wife's aisle cart ran out of the beef option but mine was stocked with it. When she requested for the beef she was merely told they ran out. I had to point out to the FA in her aisle to get the selection from the other cart. The food was pretty tasty for airline food though. Twice requested for coffee and it never came. No after meal drink run and the FAs were just in the galley chatting away. I recall the time when the saving grace of Philippine Airlines was the friendly and efficient service of the staff. Now they seem to even be losing that.

A hot meal is provided which is a welcome return to service and cabin crew are polite and efficient. The first leg was on time but the flight from Manila was dreadful as we were boarded 45 minutes late (terminal 2 is far inferior to terminal 3 - hot crowded noisy and like a greenhouse) but then sat on the stifling plane to sweat for a further 2 hours.

Upon arrival in Manila I couldn't help notice that the cabin staff were still cleaning up in the galley just a few minutes before our touch down in Manila. As a European I'm used to that the cabin is usually ready for arrival at least 15 minutes before touch down. There was no personal monitors however for a 2 hour flight that's not an issue for me.

Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2013-02-15,Return Vancouver - Manila return on Boeing777. Online booking got me a good seat in the front - not what I call the second class business class back one compartment same as on the Airbus 340. The 777 is not as new as I expected but much better than the tired old 340s. Seats are a bit complicated to figure out with all the controls. Pitch is excellent with lots of room and I had nobody beside me on both legs. This was good as there are no seat pockets to store books or any items. The 777 is better configured and has a nice AVOD system although the choices were somewhat limited in music and TV shows. On the return leg the system crashed at the half way point and never came back on. The 777 is about one hour faster than the 340 and makes the trip a bit faster which is a bonus. Food was okay and service very good and attentive. My last 340 flight last year the cabin crew disappeared after dinner service but on this flight they were always around.

Fine for short flights but not good for long trips. The seats in the middle rows have ample leg room though the seats by the windows are quite cramped. As for the in-flight entertainment - there is no provision for personal entertainment only a large LCD screen with poor image quality. The same movie was shown twice.

Commendation however should be given to the in-flight crew who did a superb job with their pleasant service attitude. Food was ample and delicious but where it lacked was in presentation. Midnight snacks offered after dinner which helped quell my hunger due to the long flight (flight skipped the Guam technical stop and so it became a long 14 hour non-stop flight LAX-MNL). Since I flew on a similar aircraft MNL-LAX 19 days earlier I was disappointed however that the legroom on this 747-400 was shorter than the aircraft I flew on earlier. Having been a regular flyer of Philippine Airlines I was pleasantly surprised at the enhancements experienced on over-all service on these flights.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,9,2012-10-17,Flew SFO-MNL-BKK. Aircraft 747 was adequate. Compared to top tier carriers Philippine Airlines Business Cabin is cheaper with enough legroom and great food. Staff friendly and attentive. Generally I fly Thai or Singapore to BKK but Philippine Airlines offered the best quality of service for Business travelers for the cheapest fares in Business Class. Would recommend for those who want to save but still have a quality of service.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2012-10-08,MNL-BKK-MNL. Wouldn't normally fly Business Class but found a bargain fare. Was assigned a seat in the former First Class cabin of an old A340 with seats and legroom a couple of notches better than the regular Business Class cabins. Seat showed its age but well maintained and comfortable; was able to lower it into an almost flat position and managed to have a very good nap. Staff attentive and their enthusiasm seemed quite genuine. Nothing fancy in the meal service but the food was tasty and plenty of it - ask for the excellent mango smoothie! Inflight entertainment was sub-par not even as good as economy in the top-tier airlines. Overall very satisfied and will gladly fly with them again.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,10,2012-09-13,I flew PAL for the first time on a trip to Manila and Bangkok from Honolulu. The service was good and food was tasty. Flight Attendants were courteous and friendly.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,10,2012-09-11,YVR–MNL-YVR (Aug 26 Sep 10). The service was great. The flight attendants were always available to assist passengers and several times they go around to give water and snacks. They serve dinner and breakfast. The food is tasty and comparable with other Asian airlines. The B777-300 aircraft is spotless the legroom is ample the seat will recline and it has personal entertainment system with good selections of movies games and music. Overall PAL did a good job and I will fly with them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,10,2012-09-03,BKK-MNL business class on the refurbished B747. Flight on time. Meals were tasty. Legroom was ample and seat reclined to around 160 degrees. Asked flight purser to reserve an item for me from their duty-free upon delivery and she gladly delivered it to me right after a few minutes even before take-off. AVOD was also working and offered several options.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2012-07-22,BXU-MNL-HKG-MNL. Basically on time all sectors. As all sectors were 2 hrs or less didn't really miss fancy entertainment system. Cabin crew were good as was the food.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,3,2012-07-22,Flight 102 from Manila to LAX July 15 2012 returning home to LA from lovely trip to Thailand. We flew from Bangkok to Manila then Manila to LAX. First flight delayed by 5 hours which prevented us from taking the original second flight. The airline did a good job of trying to reach us about it ground staff in Bangkok did a good job of getting us onto a later flight and ground staff in Manila airport did a good superb job of expediting us from the first flight to the second which had been held for us and seven other people who had the same problem. It had been held an entire hour waiting for those last 9 passengers - with all other passengers on board and apparently no AC. Plane felt like a sauna when we boarded. From here it all goes down hill. This was the most uncomfortable plane I have ever been on. Very little legroom and the seats were unusually narrow so no elbow room. When the guy in front tilted his chair back it felt uncomfortable and intrusive. Food was average except for the fluffy cake desserts. Service was adequate some attendants were nice but others seemed apathetic. We would not choose Philippine Airlines again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2012-07-15,The new Boeing 777 on the Australia routes (serving MEL and SYD from MNL) makes a huge difference as it has AVOD. Flights were full in economy in both directions with excellent punctuality coming back but half an hour late or so on the forward journey. Overall a good experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2012-07-04,My flight from Iloilo to Manila and on to Los Angeles was really good. The food was good but the inflight entertainment was pretty bad. However I think they are getting new inflight entertainment so I would recommend PAL.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2012-07-01,MNL-YVR-MNL. The service is impeccable. Check-in is a breeze. From ground crew to cabin crew they were hospitable and assist you all the time. Long Haul Business Class is just smooth for nearly 12 hours flight and the entertainment is indeed good. Food is good though it needs more presentation.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,3,2012-06-24,Manila to Vancouver April 15 2012. Crowded flight-terminal hot and waiting area over flowing with passengers-long evasive pre-flight baggage check. Plane an old Airbus 340. Seats adequate. Entertainment system terrible with only three channels one so fuzzy could not watch it. Plane was hot and complained twice to no avail. Passenger to my left had a caregiver to attend to her and she blocked the aisle for 30 % of the flight. Staff were pleasant enough and food adequate. Prices have increased to the point where it is poor value for the money. I asked to be seated in the premium business section as I have been a Mabuhay member since 2005. I was refused and I know the section was almost empty. Will never fly PAL again to Canada.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,1,2012-06-13,3 flight delays in one trip! HKG-Manila-Tagbilaran City Bohol. For the first flight when we arrived the boarding gate there was no aircraft at HKG for Manila. We waited an hour for departure and arrived in Manila one hour later than scheduled. We asked the crews and interestingly they said the connecting flight to Tagbilaran city would wait for us. After we landed we rushed to transfer desk and were informed that the connecting flight had already departed. Subsequently the airline scheduled us for an early flight the next morning. Arranged shuttle to and from hotel. Return flight from Tagbilaran City to Manila delayed 20mins. When we reached the boarding gate for connecting flight back HKG we almost missed the flight with only 8 mins to spare. No one helped us through the domestic terminal to the international airport. However the flight back HKG was delayed again. Overall total: 25% on time rate!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,2,2012-06-10,I am waiting for my international flight as we speak and I have never been on such a disorganized airline! After passing several gates and several metal detectors and waiting in several lines I wanted to sit relax eat and wander around and shop until my flight. Unfortunately that is not happening because we had to go through an additional line baggage screening pat down and talk to more people at their kiosk! We could not have our water that we just bought inside the gate area and now we are stuck in a roped off area at our gate unable to go out and have lunch or a drink of water! I am so frustrated if only they had checked all of our stuff properly at the gate entrance there would not be this problem of waiting and not being able to leave. This is the first time using Philippine Airlines and I will not be using them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,9,2012-06-07,CEB-MNL I was excited to try their Mabuhay Class onboard their brand new B777-300ER. I had a great time with them. Check-in was a breeze and boarding was smooth for business class. Seat was very comfortable and I could fly that seat for 16 hours with no discomfort. The B777 features an AVOD. Food was average though it was a pasta meal they served on business class. Landing was smooth as always. I will definitely fly them again.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,1,2012-05-23,Manila to Vancouver. The seat was ok not too crowded nice screen on the seat back to watch movies etc. The female stewardesses were rude with no please or thank you. I had no blanket when I asked the stewardess she told me if it wasn't on my seat it was too bad as there were no more. Aircraft was good  service staff need to be brought up to standards!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,2,2012-05-21,Good food could have done with more liquid refreshment baby bassinet on floor meaning no legroom in bulkhead row reasonable AVOD IFE no airshow (map) on entire plane on return journey. Terrible terminal at MNL for arrivals (1hr wait for immigration 1.5 hr wait for baggage) terrible terminal at MNL for departures (cannot buy liquids airside despite going through 2x security lines little to eat few places to sit aircon broken down). I've flown with Cebu Pacific and PAL before and used all 3 terminals at MNL but this is by far the worst experience so far in so many ways.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2012-05-17,MNL to Tag Bohol. Flight on time flight attendants very professional and service was great. Quite expensive but I will definitely fly them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,9,2012-05-14,Travelled PR several times already both on International and Domestic routes and on both J and Y class. Impressed that no flight was delayed. Their new safety video catches one's attention. Food is not the best but not the worst one either. PAL may be a bit expensive compare to other local airlines but you get what you paid for.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,7,2012-05-10,Cotabato (RPMC) to Manila (RPLL). I was not impressed nor disappointed. Flight delayed 45 minutes. The service was fine. The cabin crew were very professional very informative displays however their inflight snack was a let down. Aircraft was an Airbus A319. Although there was enough leg room the space is still so limited that you cannot go to the washroom without disturbing other passengers. My return flight to Cotabato was a little bit better. Delayed only 20 minutes the plane was Airbus A320 the snack was a little better considering they served coffee that day and the cabin crew professional as always. However the cabin was too hot.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,7,2012-05-09,MNL-PEK-MNL on an airbus 320. New clean with good legroom even in economy. No personal AVOD only overhead screens but a good movie selection. Both flights on time and inflight catering was good with ice cream served. Flight attendants very professional.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,6,2012-05-07,BKK-MNL-KLO return O/N in Manila on outbound trip. First leg non-refurbished 747-400 A319 on flights to and from KLO and A330 return to BKK. All flights were delayed IFE was on overhead monitors and bulkhead screen. Seat comfort was okay service was professional. Vegetarian Meal was tasty and drinks snacks and ice cream were served. Some passengers weren't given their meal preference as it had run out and were given what was left. Overall experience was not bad but not great either. I flew PAL for the scheduling and destinations and would fly with them again based on price and routing.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,5,2012-05-07,Hostesses were great the plane was clean and the food average. The entertainment was below standard on the flight from Melbourne to Manila I could only see a screen 8 rows in front of me in the next section. They need to lift their game to get more westerners to fly with them. If you want the whole package fly Singapore or New Zealand.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2012-04-24,Cancelled flight from Cebu to Narita and didn't tell the passengers until after 8 hours waiting in the terminal. Never offered any compensation. Plane left the following day like nothing happened and everything was normal. A truly non-caring airline towards customers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,4,2012-04-23,MNL-CEB-MNL. No problems with check-in and security in Manila. NAIA Terminal 2 was a bit spartan but much nicer compared to the dreaded old NAIA 1. Boarding this non-AVOD A330 (filthy inside and out) and departing 30 minutes behind schedule. No blankets or pillows offered. No service except for some peanuts/crackers and coffee/tea/water. Safety video not played and a live manual demo was done. Overhead screens not functioning not even the airshow. Inflight magazine missing from all Economy Class seats. Seats fairly comfortable legroom much better than Cebu Pacific but lesser than Korean Air. Carpets and footrest are filthy. Cebu airport is in a bad state though check-in was not a hassle. Return flight on A330 equipment change from a 747. Same complaints concerning the overhead bins and food/drinks however this time overhead screens were functioning but only airshow was shown and a live safety demo was done in lieu of airing a safety video. In short mediocre (but not poor) experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,6,2012-04-21,Generally good service and comfortable flight purchased ticket on Philippine Airlines where the website stated it included a meal. This was a small packet of peanuts and soft drink! This does not represent good value when compared to the other budget airlines operating in the Philippines. Flights are often delayed cancelled or simply amalgamated with flights of their sister airline Phil Air Express.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,9,2012-04-04,SGD-MNL. Check-in was fast and the ground crew were friendly. The plane took of with a 10 min delay. The food was really good and were provided with blankets for the night flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,6,2012-04-03,LAX-MNL-CEB-MNL-LAX. Flight to MAN from LAX was very uneventful food was passable refurbished 747-400. Comfortable seats good friendly service. MAN-CEB on a refurbished 747-400 good service again although they do not let you use your cell phone while waiting for pushback. Return trip from CEB-MAN used the new 777 it was spacious seats were comfortable and aircraft was clean. MNL-LAX plane delayed 30 mins in MAN 747 was not refurbished stuffing coming out of seats plane had to divert to Sapporo Japan to fix ventilation system but the staff were friendly in helping us with the problem.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2012-04-02,Departing for Narita on B777. Smooth check-in. Nice plane. Clean cabin but the seating scheme is awkward! Less choices of magazines. Nice food and attendants however music and movies need updating.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2012-02-28,Aircraft interior was aged and in serious need of upgrade. Inflight entertainment system was old screens were colourless and almost impossible to see. Inflight safety instruction via said screens could not be seen from where I was sitting. Cabin temperature was hot and humid complaints to cabin staff were ignored. Food quality and service was very bad for an international carrier. Service is lax and uninterested.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,5,2012-02-15,PVG-MNL. Nothing great and nothing bad. Typical Philippine airline equipment problem my foot rest had been broken for a while. Entertainment was by a large screen and poor choices of entertainment. It seems it is the little things that dog this airline in addition to the chaos of going to MNL airport.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,9,2012-02-15,Sydney to Manila return flight Manila-Melbourne-Sydney. Plane delayed in Sydney due to a problem loading cargo. Aircraft on both trips A340 no personal screens but radio was great and entertainment on overhead screens decent. Plane comfortable and spacious compared to A330. Food was good. More than enough food on return trip. Cabin and lavatory very clean. Staff friendly. Inflight magazine interesting plus exclusive terminal in Manila is convenient. Both flights were pleasant.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2012-02-13,SGP-MNL-LAX. All except one flight was delayed. Did not really like the A320. A bit to small and only had overhead screens. Boeing 747 was a lot better. Interior was new and had personal TV screens. Flight to LAX even took off 10 mins early. Overall I think PAL should just refurbish their airbus A320's to the ones like the Boeing 747. Terminal 2 should also be expanded and renovated.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,3,2012-01-28,I flew to Manila and return to Australia on the 25 Jan. On my trip back to Australia we left Manila at 9 am and arrived Sydney at 8 pm - we had one main meal all day and a snack before we landed Sydney. I paid $2000 for my return airfares to Manila and I ended up hungry. I think we pay enough airfares to be served a decent amount of food. There was also a mix up with my seat I checked in at 5 am only to find somebody else sitting in my seat however in the end staff sorted it out.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,6,2011-12-19,MNL-CGK-MNL. Terminal 2 check-in was fine though Jakarta was very slow. On time departures and arrivals on all flights. Food and drinks choices were okay. All in all okay flights the price was nothing special.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,7,2011-12-19,"HKG-MNL MNL-TAG and TAG-MNL. Chose B777-300ER service out of HKG. Seat width a bit limited due to layout but pitch is good. Seat pitch usual A320 layout on domestic flights which is tight in economy. IFE on 777 is good. Good choice for short flight. Overhead screens on domestic sectors. FA's the usual PAL staff. Some (very) friendly and some ""only"" professional. Could do with consistency on the friendly side. Flights during service provider transition period. But hot meal available on international leg. Choice and quality was good. Better than CX that only serve a bun. No internet check-in available. Overall value for money.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,7,2011-12-13,SIN-MNL-LAX. SIN to MNL on A320 - 5 hours no personal IFE (only drop-down overhead LCD TV) only breads and drinks were available FA's were hiding for majority of the time. Seat was okay nothing special about this flight. MNL to LAX: it was the old un-refurbished 747-400. Ground staff were helpful but the security check line took forever. Even though I had to wait for about 10 hrs in the airport they only gave us two food vouchers. In the 744 no personal IFE they only put the map on the big LCD projector seat was okay meal was not attractive but it was delicious however they served it a bit late. FA was attentive bathroom and cabin were not that clean but still okay. I chose Philippine Airlines because I got very cheap tickets ($ 700 for SIN-LAX return trip).,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,2,2011-12-08,Called and reserved window seat and that also fully reclined. I got a window seat just infront of emergency exit. The seat did not recline. Flight was supposed to be non-stop but stopped in Hawaii for over 1 hour to off load and receive passengers. Checked my ticket and printed itinerary it all said non-stop. Good thing for me I had no connecting flight I had to meet in limited time. On the return reserved window seat that reclined however seems they changed the plane from a 747-400 to something that looked like it could only hop from island to island. I had 2 choices and chose the lesser of two evils that still required me to get out of my seat no less than 12 times to allow people to go to and from the rest room and visit friends. There was no stop at Hawaii on the return trip. Seats not made for long haul and very uncomfortable after only 1 hour. Service was mediocre. Food was ok.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,1,2011-11-25,Manila to Jakarta on A320. Crew lack courtesy asking passenger to pass on meals to their seat mates. Crew would pass on blankets headphones and even meal boxes on top of people's heads and sometimes a row away from the recipient. Food is awful and is not served in paper boxes. Coffee is now served in styrofoam which is environmentally unfriendly. PAL has downgraded its meal service. I think PAL should now be identified as a budget airline rather than a 3 star airline even if their fares are almost the same as other 5 star airlines.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,7,2011-11-24,LAS-MNL MNL-HKG HKG-LAS. Average trip all but one flight arrived on time. Food is so-so. Flight from HKG- MNL loaded and ready 15 mins early but due to ATC delays left almost 1 hr late. Crew were informative and apologetic. Extra $50 for Economy Plus seat worth it on LAS-MNL segment. Transfer from HKG flight in Manila to LAS flight is a test of your patience no direct gate to gate access. You go to the Transfer Desk they take your passport and boarding pass confirm they have located your luggage. Escort you upstairs to passport control through a metal detector and patdown then to the gate for a final passport inspection. Only then are you allowed to proceed to the boarding gate. All this for a same airline flight transfer. We were then an hour late leaving MNL. No seatback IVOD and screens were hard to see.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,2,2011-10-16,Not a fan. Have now made 4 business class trips from LAX-MNL or SFO-MNL. B747s in Business Class are OK but the Airbus is old and the business class seats uncomfortable and sub-standard. The food is horrible. Can't give it a good rating.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,3,2011-09-15,CGK-MNL-FUK. The seat was old the plane was dirty with water flowing from the lavatory. There's no pillow or blanket left for me no explanation just they left me freezing. The food is okay on my transit time at NAIA they gave passengers a coupon for breakfast but they don't give any information as to where we can use it. Shocked that there was no personal TV and the headset do not work well.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2011-09-12,MNL-CEB-MNL. From MNL check-in was quick and easy until we get to the waiting area of Terminal 2 which was packed with people early in the morning which was understandable considering it was peak season. We were delayed about 20-30 mins. On boarding the A330-300 the seat was fairly comfortable although I think the legroom was a little small. The cabin crew were alright the cabin temperature good enough. On the return check- in was quick and easy delayed again for 30 mins. Before boarding one of PAL's newest B777-300ER the cabin ambience was good and everything felt good the seats were new and comfortable legroom roomy good IFE system this plane is more comfortable than the older A330. Cabin crew were nice and accommodating the second flight was the real value for our money.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,9,2011-08-31,MNL-SYD return. I was expecting a newer/refurbished plane but unfortunately it was an old one. Food was acceptable nothing special. Toilets were clean. Flights a few minutes delayed. What won me over however were the hospitable flight attendants. Smiling and courteous.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,9,2011-08-31,MNL-PPS on Business Class. Pleasantly surprised when they replaced the aircraft to the A330 for this domestic flight (instead of the A320). Good service with full breakfast in Mabuhay Class. Flight attendants excellent and focused on attending to passengers needs.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2011-08-11,TPE-MNL-VAN. The food is awful seats are old worn out and cramped (Airbus A340). Service is poor with stewardesses and ground staff dismissive if you can get their attention. Shared TV with few screens. They now charge $50 for an exit row seat. If you need to transfer in Manila be warned: the transfer process involves a lot of pointless hanging around.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,4,2011-07-28,If you're flying to Manila you can avoid the awful international terminal by flying Philippine Airlines (PAL). In the past 3 months I have flown twice a month on PAL and over 70% of the time they are late. It's only when you're checked in and sitting in the lounge that the inevitable delays are announced. Even 4 hr delays appear to take PAL by surprise. The aircraft are ok cabins a little shabby.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2011-07-24,SFO-MNL. Flight over was not refurbished plane old video monitors broken and one of our seats wouldn't recline however they did change our seats. Food is good but for a westerner would like to see more choices other than traditional plates. Even special meals are geared toward Asian cultures. Went to PAL office in Manilla to complain about being sold a ticket under false advertisement when website shows updated planes. Staff called me after visit to office to tell me the plane on the return would be an updated plane. On the return the seats were electric lie flats great pillows and blankets and the same FA's were on both legs. The FA's have always been professional personable and eager to make your trip enjoyable. Definitely worth the extra money for a long trip.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,9,2011-06-23,LAX-SIN via MNL. The LAX-MNL had a 50 min fuel stop in HNL. The flight left LAX late and arrived HNL late but the delay was made up for on the HNL-MNL leg. Boarding was the usual LAX chaos. The mabuhay (business) class seating on the LAX-MNL 744 flight was the airline's new seat which is a sloped 170 degree recliner. The seat was a bit firm due to the newness but comfortable and I was able to get a bit of sleep. The IFE was on par with Delta and United i.e. nothing special. The food was very mediocre but the cabin service was outstanding. The MNL-SIN leg was operated by a 320 with standard short haul business class product. The seats were adequate for a 3.5 hr flight. The food was marginally better than the LAX-MNL leg but cabin service was again outstanding. Overall PR offers very good value considering that their business class fares were significantly cheaper than the competition on the LAX-SIN route.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,1,2011-06-08,SFO to MNL Roundtrip. Flying to Manila the sinks in the lavatory was clogged and dirty water was overflowing. The security tape around the toilet had peeled off. The service was substandard. When processing through Manila Airport to return back to SFO three security check points failed to detect two bottles of water bottle of gel lighters and a small pocket knife I used while fishing. The flight back was substandard - 14 hours of no entertainment because both our screens wouldn't work. The flight attendants didn't care and their subsequent customer service support was very poor.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,6,2011-06-01,Jakarta to Manila en route Singapore using A320. Seats worn out with audio that does not function. Toilet seems to be run down and not well maintained. Food is good but needs improvement in quantity and quality. Attendants food service is extremely slow. PAL's price is no longer competitive or cheaper compared to other airlines serving the route such as SQ but the latter's service is far better than Philippine Airlines.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,5,2011-05-24,MNL-SGP. Was told flight has been delayed till 1800h then was again told flight has been delayed and was finally told at 1845h that flight has been cancelled. The staff was of no help at all and could not answer any questions being asked by passengers. No explanation was given for the cancellation. PAL could have done better in handling such situation.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2011-05-21,MNL-YVR-MNL B777-300ER. Service and inflight entertainment great. Each economy seat has it's own AVOD. Food was good.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2011-05-18,MNL-SFO-MNL. Service extremely poor Manila to San Francisco travelling with a child. We were charged US$100 for requesting bassinet seats for our child and the lady beside us travelling with babies wasn't charged at all! We then discovered no bassinets were available. We completed a formal complaint on the plane regarding the overcharge and no response from Philippine Airlines has been forthcoming. On the way back from San Francisco to Manila we were only charged $US50 for seats with a bassinet. The policy isn't consistent! Terminal two in manila travelling to SFO was just appalling - the lines were not organised.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2011-04-05,MNL-TAG-MNL. Flights on time. Check-in quick and very friendly in MNL not always the case. Cabin crew good but still the same pattern. Men and elder lady FAs friendly. Some of the younger ladies more interested in their appearance than being there for passengers. Snacks fine and choice of water coffee and tea. No OJ anymore but second runs. All in all a good experience for the price paid.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2011-03-27,MNL–SIN–MNL. Arrived on time but spend quite some time since there is a long line in the check-in counter good enough I got a window-seat. Inflight entertainment is average - A340-300 and not the Boeing B777 with AVOD. Inflight meal is tasty and good enough for a 3.5 hours flight. Flight attendants hospitable and helpful. Flight back the same long line in the check-in meal was fantastic.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,4,2011-02-27,SYD-MNL-SYD B777 is quite new and IFE was good enough for a 7-hour flight although the movie channel on MNL-SYD was unavailable for the first two hours. SYD-MNL food was average flight attendant in our cabin section was friendly. MNL-SYD plane actually left on time but staff was rude and abrupt with service. It was more the female staff who looked like they were afraid their make-up would crack if they smiled.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,7,2011-01-21,MNL-SIN return economy. Check in at MNL terminal 2 was slow but moving considering the number of flights departing and the limited ground crew available. Traveling with 3 kids we were allowed to board early Crew on both legs (same ones) very friendly and chatting with passengers and helping with carry on baggage to facilitate boarding. An hour before landing my youngest had severe motion sickness and the flight attendants were quick to help me clean up the mess and freshen the air. Food however was terrible both legs.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,7,2011-01-14,I had limited expectations for my flight from LAX-Manila. Yes the cabin interior is a bit tired Business seat was not flat food won't blow anyone away and AVOD had limited selections but it wasn't bad. We made the scheduled intermediate stop in Hawaii to add fuel and then another 11 hours to Manila from there. The service was fine and FA's were friendly enough. All in all I would say that it wasn't bad and if you would rather get there a little faster then this is an OK option.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,9,2011-01-07,HKG-MNL Economy class. The flight wasn't delayed (I seem to remember this being a regular occurence at Manila airport). The cabin crew were friendly and no problem when I requested an emergency exit seat. The ticket price was great so no complaints.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,9,2011-01-02,YVR-LAS-YVR A340. A lot of legroom and space on A340. Clean restrooms good food choices for the 2.5 hour transborder flights. IFE only showed the airshow. FA's very nice quick service. At YVR the airport displayed the gate area wrong so the ground staff came looking for us instead of using the PA's. Very nice as they lead us to the gate directly.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2010-12-22,MNL-TPE-MNL Used this airline for the 3rd time this year in international flights and more than 5 in domestic flights and the service remained the same. Friendly service from ground staff and cabin crew seat pitch adequate check-in service a breeze inflight entertainment average. The inflight catering is getting more mediocre than before taste sometimes bland and choices limited.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,7,2010-12-14,Cebu to Boracay RT. Used PAL Express/Airphils. Both flights on a Q300. Very comfortable seats. Flights all left on-time. FAs were very friendly. No food or drinks which was a negative. Not even BOB! Cabin was super warm A/C broke. Overall not bad for a short flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,4,2010-11-29,Kathmandu to Hong Kong. It is the cheapest anyone can have in this route but so are the facilities. The cabin crew are friendly the seats are old and not comfortable there is no entertainment during the flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2010-11-13,SYD-MNL given aisle seat and pretty comfortable on A330. Food wasn't too bad. MNL-MEL nice ground staff bag had 5kgs over allowance on a fully booked flight and was checked in. Onboard food was disappointing.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,7,2010-11-03,Manila to Narita flight on their new 777 good legroom on economy equipped with the latest in flight entertainment personal AVOD. Food was good and they gave ice cream and cakes for dessert. Return flight on older A330 no personal IFE food also good. Cabin crew professional and service was average to good. Overall good value for what you paid for compared to Delta who is operating also on the same route (direct).,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,10,2010-09-09,MNL-SYD. Check-in swift B777-300ER with a clean interior. Cabin Crew professional attentive to safety and delivered service with a smile. Call bells were promptly answered. The dinner was delicious. Y Class touches included footrests small amenity kit with eye shades newspapers offered USB access at each seat easy to use IFE with great audio and video choices and cabin announcements were kept to a minimum by the crew resulting in minimal disruption for the night flight. The only setback was the cabin temperature which was kept very cold. Would certainly fly PAL again as they provided a friendly service which was value for money.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,9,2010-08-23,CGY-MNL. Check-in very fast and agent friendly. A319 seats very comfortable legroom aso good. FAs friendly - 4 FAs serving the economy section. Peanuts and cookies served. IFE is drop- down LCDs airshow map then a tv show.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,6,2010-07-19,RUH-MNL. B747-400 is not refurbished interior of aircraft showing its age. Seats are not comfortable overhead bin are shaking inflight entertainment is very poor. FA friendly and professional food excellent. The advantage is direct flight from Riyadh to Manila. I hope PAL will use new aircraft on this route - it should be equipped with better inflight entertainment and comfortable seats.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,3,2010-06-29,KTM-HKG. Food was good service was nice. Cabin crew would promptly attend to you when you buzz them. Ticket was cheap compared to other airlines flying KTM to HKG. All in all would fly again with them if they keep their on-time schedule.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2010-06-28,Manila to Melbourne business class in new 777 and was very pleased by the experience. Only problem was arriving early and having to wait for quarantine officers to arrive. The seats lack privacy but comfortable (not lie flat) good service and good IFE. Food average.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2010-06-20,MNL-ILO-CEB-MNL in economy class. Check-in was fast and efficient. Offered coffee tea juices and some peanuts and biscuits during these short flights which I think reasonably ok. Newer planes and friendly service from the attentive cabin crew.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,9,2010-06-02,(HGK-MNL) One way business class. Surprising good experience. check in was fast business class lounge was excellent. Plenty of food drinks periodicals. Excellent service in flight. Too bad the little things hurt PAL. Seat was not fully operational. Luggage was the first on the carousel. I have had good experience with PAL in Biz class and will continue to use them into Manila.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,7,2010-06-01,SFO-MNL-SIN businessrefurbished 747-400 with Recaro seats. Service very good. Seats are not proper lie flat). I found it hard to sleep for long periods as I kept sliding down. Food was very good though wine service was odd. I had to select red or white wine before the meal and there didn't seem to be an option to switch between courses. Transfer in Manila was very weird. They weighed my hand luggage and I had to remove my laptop to show that it was under some weight limit (I had no questions or issues in SFO). Manila business class lounge is an utter joke. Mind you SFO lounge is not that much better.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2010-06-01,MNL-PPS-MNL. A320 outbound clean service friendly - only tea/coffee and nibbles but only one hour flight. US$100 return fare very reasonable. A330 on return also near new and excellent service again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2010-05-28,MNL-SFO B747-400 business class had the new interior with new seating carpets and panels. The seats are angled lie flat type but much more comfortable than the old. Service was impeccable. Meals were very good. Only wine choices were red or white. Did not use the personal video as this was a night flight.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,5,2010-05-07,BKK-MNL-BKK. I usually avoid PAL after a few bad experiences mainly around delays but both flights were one time. Cabin was full both times and meal service was fine with plenty of drinks rounds even in the middle of the night. IFE was broken on my seat both flights but other than that the A320 was modern clean and comfortable. I still prefer the budget airlines for regional routes around Asia. Philippine Airlines are expensive and I'd rather have the money in my pocket than a meal a movie and mabuhay miles.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2010-04-25,Manila-Kalibo-Manila Business Class. Domestic Business Class check in was quick. Domestic Business Class lounge with attentive waiters. Limited food selection but the soup was very good. My wife and I received attentive service as we were the only passengers in business class. Pre-flight orange juice offered but inflight sandwiches and some fruits was unappetizing. Check in at Kalibo Airport was chaotic although there were only about 50 passengers on the line. Again no priority boarding for business class passengers. Business Class cabin full on this flight. FAs attentive and friendly. Pre-flight orange juice offered. Inflight meal was again a dissapointment. A320 seats in business class for both flights are comfortable but showing their age.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2010-04-25,BKK-MNL return in Business. In BKK the lounge is Thai Royal Silk which is good quality. A320 new and everything worked including AVOD with a good selection. Business seat similar to US domestic first class - big seat but not much recline. Food was OK and service was attentive and personal no complaints.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2010-02-24,BKK-MNL. Flight crew was lacking. Whilst some were making an effort one was completely unprofessional and was rude. Whatever happened to PAL Smiles and Filipino hospitality? I guess they're only reserved for foreign passengers. Everyone else in Business Class might as well sit in Economy because they get Economy service.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,5,2010-02-23,Business Class from Manila to Cebu and back. Philippine Airlines utilizes its A330 for the Cebu route making the flight quick and relaxing. Disappointing were the meals in-flight - not as good as it used to be. Good thing they serve their trusty old Arroz Caldo in all their Mabuhay lounges. A well stocked bar free WiFi and reading materials made the wait at these lounges pleasant. Flight attendants remain young for the domestic routes and service was still friendly. PTV's in the A330 need to be replaced as they were all not functioning properly and did not have enough channels to choose from. Lavatories were clean. Arriving at both airports was smooth and Mabuhay Class passengers get their luggage before everyone else.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,6,2010-02-11,YVR-MNL-YVR in economy class A340-300. Planes were old seat not comfortable and pitch must have been 30-31 inches. Older FA was rude but younger ones were polite. They seem to be in a rush serving dinne as soon as take off. An hour after dinner I needed water but no FA in sight - waited for 10 mins then pressed call button. FA didn't come until 15 mins later and was rude - seems like I bothered them. An hour later I walked down the aisle to the business class area and took a peak. There was no passenger in there all I saw was FAs sitting and some were sleeping. Now the lack of service started to make sense.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,7,2010-02-09,HKG-MNL-HKG 320/330 Check in at HKG and Manila went smoothly so was the boarding and Immigration. Onboard food was good and the service was better with the female crew then the male crew. All flights was on time and aircraft in good shape.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,7,2010-01-26,MNL-TPE-MNL in Economy class. Check-in at NAIA Terminal 2 a breeze. A320 new food was served immediately and good enough for a 2-hour flight while inflight entertainment was average. Flight attendants hospitable. On the return leg again check-in a breeze the plane this time is quite old Airbus A320. Inflight entertainment needs to be updated.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,3,2010-01-23,SFO-MNL. Business class was showing its age and lack comfort. Meals average with poor presentation. The crew were literally non existent and when present did not smile.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,6,2010-01-13,MNL-BKK return Business class. Tickets were not that cheap compared to TG so I question the value of putting up with slow clumsy service old seats and bad food. MNL-BKK leg started well with pre take of drinks and hot towels. Food orders were taken and meals were served properly. Food quality was mediocre at best. BKK-MNL was disappointing. No pre take off drinks or towels. Food orders taken but service was slow while they appeared rushed. Lots of spilling and plates falling on the floor. Food was inedible. For a little more money TG would be a world of difference for the same route.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,2,2010-01-12,KLO-MNL return flight was my worst experience. Flight attendants not friendly at all not even smiling. Also they let the passengers put the baggage in the overhead compartments even when the aircraft is taxing to the runway they'll ask you to remove your seatbelt and stand-up to put that baggage. The announcements are simple and not detailed compared to the other local airlines. MNL-NRT by Philippine airlines and that was another a worst experience. My seat was broken and cannot be reclined.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2010-01-03,MNL-ZAM return. Fairly new A320 well-maintained tight seat pitch but adequate. Flights on time with good information from flight deck. Cabin crew efficient: on domestic flights only tea/coffee and nibbles are offered. Generally a good in-flight experience. On the ground check-in staff are strict on weight - expect to pay if you have in excess of 15kg hold baggage for domestic flights. Also have local currency to pay the 200 peso departure tax at all airports. Overall the flight experience compared very favourably with domestic and regional flying in UK and Europe.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,7,2009-12-08,BCD-MNL-BCD. A320 Plane was not the reffited one - AirAsia (a budget airline) have more comfortable seats and leg room. Crew nice and chatty to some passengers but to the rest polite only. Majority of PAL crew need more training in following filipino hospitality. Some are robotic or rude some also back-stab the airline to passengers. The only difference with Economy Light is that you get assigned the most back seats and no peanuts and skyflakes.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2009-12-07,TPE-LAX via MNL in business. All flights on time cabin clean food good and staff professional. Bathrooms kept clean. Only letdowns were the inflight entertainment system and the lounge in Manila (it looks more like a dormitory lounge than what should be the airline's flagship lounge). Very good value for money.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,6,2009-11-15,MNL-Kalibo-MNL and MNL-HKG. Domestic service usual PAL service. Noticed that some ground staff and cabin crew members tend to be friendlier to Caucasian travellers than Pinoy people. Check- in quick and baggage delivery on both legs alright. MNL-HKG: PAL has cut on the meal as no longer any bread on the tray. Service efficient in the PAL manner. One thing PAL has to address is their ground staff. They make you feel they do you a favour by checking you in. Although travelling on two tickets (party of 3 people) as I only needed a one way ticket we checked in together. She managed to sit us apart. We had to return to the check in counter to get seats assigned next to each other. All in all a 3 star airline that could be more if they would take more attention to details. An upgrade of NAIA2 facilities would do well as well i.e. domestic terminal flights are allocated to check in counters in a way no one understands and they are written down on a paper printout. Noticed that number of FAs onboard international flights is very high though one does not notice it service wise.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,1,2009-11-15,Philippines Airlines Business Class - there is space which you'd expect but the cabin was horrible and in my return Manila-Honolulu flight I changed seats 4 times to find a seat that worked correctly or a TV screen that would hold itself up. The plane was very old and to be honest a bit scary. I hope they maintain the engines better than they do the cabin. I fly business class on flights over 7 hours and this was the worst experience I have ever had. This airline is brutal with excess luggage - even 1Kg is charged (on this sector) US$150 -this is what they tried to charge me for my surfboard coming back from Honolulu. The confusing part for me is they didn't charge me to go over with it so I was shocked when they tried to charge me at Honolulu. I talked my way out of it and I could see the person had heard it all before as she tired of saying the same thing.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2009-10-12,LAX-MNL/MNL-LAX. Philippine Airlines new Business Class product which I was quite pleased with. The cabin was clean modern and fully staffed. They have the new angled lie flat seats which are quite nice. Entertainment system pretty good. The dinner service was excellent. The only glitch is the wine list - only two choices. The service in general was warm friendly and sincere. The over all in flight product is good and a great value for your money. However reservations and check in can be touched up a bit.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,8,2009-09-17,YVR-SIN-YVR in Business Class. Older A340's non stop Vancouver- Manila and new A320's on the Manila - Singapore. A340 is showing its age and business class seating is old style (their 747's have been refurbished to the new biz style but not the A340) the service on board was attentive and professional. The food was very good and well presented. A few drink runs would have been appreciated without having to press the call button. Very good lounges (shared) were provided in both Vancouver and Singapore while the Philippine Airlines Mabuhay Lounge in Manila was available during the transit stop. The Manila lounge does let the product down as it is nowhere as nice as the others. Service and food on the regional flight between Manila and Singapore was as good as long haul. Luggage both ways was handled in priority manner. Overall a very satisfactory product especially for the price PAL charge for their business when compared to some alternatives.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Philippine Airlines customer review,4,2009-04-16,KTM-BKK Flight in March 2009 as it was only half the price of Thai. Booking Check-in and Boarding went surprisingly without problem or delay. B757 is pretty old but clean inside. The staff provided a good service with a hot meal and passengers are provided with the Thai immigration papers. The inflight entertainment is outside the window as you see lots of the Himalayas for the first 40 mins after departure.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2007-11-30,BKK-KTM economy. B-757 pleasant and clean. This was the cheapest option BKK-KTM and our expectations were low. We were surprised! Very friendly and serviceminded cabin staff in traditional local dresses. Good language skills and plenty of information from the captain and FA. Good local food. Arrival on time despite delay from BKK. No baggage problems and high level of service in KTM intl airport. An overall positive experience in spite of lack of IFE. I would definitely choose Royal Nepal Airlines again and have recommended others to fly them.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2007-11-23,HKG-KTM. On the whole not bad left on time Cabin crew friendly. Plane a bit dated magazine was fairly informative. The best thing was the food hot fresh and tasty.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2007-07-28,I am a Nepalese and well used to the awful standards of Nepal Airlines formerly Royal Nepal Airlines. If you are thinking of flying by Nepal Airlines don't ! Pay the extra and find another carrier. They have been operating their international services with two ancient Boeing 757s and both were grounded in early May resulting in the cancellation of all their international flights. These long delays and cancellations have happened to me several times in the past and I now pay the extra money and fly by Thai Airways on the same route. If you are lucky enough to take off the meals and wines are good and the crews are efficient enough and do speak English regardless of any previous comments on this site. I want to be proud of my national carrier but at the moment it is a complete shambles and I advise everybody not to fly on this airline.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2007-05-23,I had the misfortune of making a booking on Royal Nepal Airlines from Kathmandu to Delhi. Little did I know that this was the worst airline I had ever encountered. I had a connecting flight at Delhi. On the morning of my departure I arrived at the airport only to discover that the flight had been cancelled. I was told to return to Kathmandu as the offices opened at 10am. Only after we myself and a few other passengers refused to go away did the ground staff make a plan to get us on an alternative flight with Sahara Airlines. On arriving at Delhi there was absolutely no Royal Nepal Airlines staff to meet us to try and arrange alternative flights or even provide support in any way. It cost me about $700 to make alternative arrangements as I had missed my connecting flight. Never use Royal Nepal Airlines they are absolutely useless.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2006-05-05,KTM-HKG Business Class. Arriving at the airport we were faced with huge lines to get in as all baagage had to be x-rayed prior to check in. No agent present at the business class check in counter so my wife and I proceeded to the economy check in. Only one person in front. The agent was friendly and soon gave us our boarding passes with the Economy Class name crossed out and Business Class written by hand - nice. Flight was delayed due to late arrival of aircraft - not an unusual occurrence with Royal Nepal - most people are just thankful the flight's not cancelled. Flight departed an hour and a half late though we arrived just 20 minutes past our scheduled arrival time. On board there were 2 FA for the 9 people sitting up front (including 2 relief pilots). Meals were fine and service was friendly. No inflight entertainment - only international news magazines and newspapers were available. FAs came around frequently to check if everything was ok. Overall an ok experience - the staff usually try their best but are let down by shoddy management ageing planes and poor infrastructure at the airport.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2005-02-24,Granted this airlines has lot of problems I disagree with the comment that airline crew speak little to no English. Their English is quite good actually. In fact better than lot of airlines in South East Asia.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2004-12-13,I would agree with everyone in terms of Royal Nepal Airlines and its timings and delays. However those are not the only problems this airline faces. It has only two aircrafts (the 757-200 and the 757-200C) which have no form of entertainment onboard the cabin crew only speak Nepali Hindi and very little or no English. And they know no other language which is quite important considering most tourists are from Japan and France who will definitely have a lot to complain about. Being Nepali I have had to fly this airline thrice and all the flights turned out to be as bad as the last one. The airline personnel in Delhi for RNAC is the worst I've ever come across as well. All these problems are probably due to corruption.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2004-03-09,Royal Nepal Airlines - you cannot depend upon its timing and the airline should take care of time.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2003-09-30,I think Royal Nepal Airlines is one of the most unreliable airlines in the South Asian region in terms of timing. I have had to travel on Royal Nepal (not out of choice!) on Kathmandu-Delhi sector a number of times and it is never on time. The delays are of the order of six to eight hours for a flight of one and a half hours.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2003-05-03,I have flown both Royal Nepal and Thai Airways on the route between Bangkok and Kathmandu and I prefer Thai. Royal Nepal is very inefficient in making any changes to your itinerary (going to their office is in fact dealing with a government bureaucracy and it feels like it) and they are chaotic in the airport. Thai is more organized and easier to deal with -- up to major airlines' standards. Royal Nepal was just fine once in the air but the plane was a little older than I would have liked.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Philippine Airlines customer review,,2002-05-24,The airline from a small kingdom in the Himalayas - I had a really good impression on the short flight from Kathmandu to Delhi. Although there is no entertainment system at all apart from its inflight magazine the crews were very friendly and attentive. The food was gorgeous! In just one hour flight full meal was served including 2 choices in econ which include hot meal bread cheese dessert salad coffee....and it was very delicious. Frankly I think that Royal Nepal Airlines meal is the best inflight meal - it's catered from the Crown Plaza Hotel. Drinks were served regularly and seats were not bad. I would give RNA at least 4 star for its excellent service.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
