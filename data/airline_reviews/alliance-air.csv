"""worst airline services available""",1,2022-11-06,"The worst airline services available till date. They ask for money on each and every step you take towards them. They made changes on their end and asked for payment. Faux changes being made two times, their executives do not want to help, they just reply with you have to make the payment whether we do it or no. Very very very disappointed. Ended up paying 38000Rs for a BOM-IKX-BOM flight.

"""worst experience through an airline""",1,2022-10-12,"My first domestic flight I took in India and my first worst experience through an airline. Counters were closed before time and nobody was there to inform travelers about it. It was all empty. There was 4 5 passengers wondering about what is going on. I had connecting flight to Canada and i had to pay amount equal to my flight booking to get my luggage done. Well some how managed to check-in but everyone was shouting at us until we reached the plane. A big zero professionalism. Plane crew was good. But if some customer is spending money on flight then you gonna treat like this and if you know your passengers are there, you gonna leave them behind. It was a worst experience i ever had. will never recommend this airline to anybody.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chandigarh to Delhi,October 2022,2,2,,1,1,,,False

"""absolute harassment by Alliance Air""",1,2022-08-16,"I had one of my worst travel experiences with Alliance Air. I had booked 3 tickets from Vijayawada to Bangalore 2 months in advance. The total price at the time of booking was Rs. 10,910/- (including all miscellaneous charges). On the date of travel, while checking in, I was informed that I had to pay an extra amount as I had availed of the ""Military discount"" at the time of booking. Nowhere in the booking portal was the ""military discount"" even mentioned. I was asked to pay an additional amount of Rs 10,422 in order to board the flight. So in total, I paid an amount of Rs 21,332/- for an economy class flight from Vijayawada to Bangalore in spite of booking the tickets 2 months in advance. Just like me, there were 18 other co-passengers who had to go through the same ordeal. This is absolute harassment by Alliance Air.
