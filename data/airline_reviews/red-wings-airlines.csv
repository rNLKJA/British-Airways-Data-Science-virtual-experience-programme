"""worst experience of my life""",1,2022-06-24,"The worst experience of my life. Flight delayed by over 8 hours, no information, no one notified me ahead of time. Iâ€™ve been in the airport since 6 am. No compensation. Airline staff incredibly rude and unhelpful. Never, ever, ever use it.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Istanbul to Moscow Zhukovsky,",June 2022,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,1,False
"""The worst experience ever""",1,2021-07-28,"I have booked a ticket on 05.07 for flight WZ-383, and due to feeling unwell, I could not join this trip. So, I tried before the flight to change the ticket online for another date, but their web-site was not working on this option plus it was hanging when it came to the point of making change, I have tried as well to call the hot line, but no one would respond, just continuous waiting. Finally they considered me as no-show customer and I lost my ticket totally. When I wrote to them in their feedback form on the web-site - they answered me firstly that I was no show, and after on 27.07 they replied that I need to send a written letter on their address via normal post, while I never expected that in 21 century any company would do so, since long time all respectful airlines and business companies are replying by e-mail officially. I guess they just hope that written letter would not reach them - so, they can close the case without giving any feedback. The worst experience ever. Never recommend to anyone.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Moscow to Saratov,July 2021,,,,,1,,,False
"""company's service makes me mad""",1,2020-08-05,"The flight was delayed for 8 hours! After ages communicating with staff finally they approved a refund, but I can't receive it till now. First, they said that they are missing some details and etc. When I ask what is missing, they do not reply at all! I receive a response via e-mail after 15 days. It's absolutely unacceptable! I am very tolerant, but this company's service makes me mad.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Moscow to Simferopol,September 2019,3,4,,1,1,,,False
