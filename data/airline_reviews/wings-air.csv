"""don't want to admit their mistakes and help""",1,2022-07-14,Not Verified |  This airline is very unprofessional they just don't want to admit their mistakes and help. They have changed my time of departure 3 weeks before my flight and did not let me know i have figured it out just day before my departure. Thanks to them I have missed my international flight paid 1500 euros more. Until now no one has admitted their mistake no one has apologised. And no one wants to help. Clearly they are ignoring my messages and also clearly they dont see my point of if i get confirmed tickets you have to let me know for any change.

In the morning there was another problem, they said my ticket couldn't be checked in. I came at 05.00 and I had to wait for 30 minutes to get my boarding pass. I was surprised again that my boarding pass was manually written, so why did I need to wait for 30 minutes if at the end they just write it down? On my return flight, Wings Air surprised me again.

"""a lack of communication""",2,2016-08-04,"✅ Verified Review |  I flew with Wings Air (part of Lion Air) as a part of a party of four surfers. We travelled from Bali to Sumbawa Besar via Lombok on Tuesday 19/7/16 and made the return trip on Friday 29/7/16. In summary of our experience do not fly Wings Air to get to your destination, particularly if you are a surfer. Cost for surfboards. The cost is Rp 200 000 per surfboard per flight. This means that flying from Bali to Sumbawa, which entailed two flights connecting in Lombok, cost Rp400 000 per board each way. We could not find this information anywhere on the Wings Air/Lion Air website, which of course would have informed our choice of airline. The Wings Air employee at check-in at Denpasar told us that the cost is indeed not on their website. Treatment of checked in surfboards - My brother paid Rp 1 200 000 for three surfboards from Sumbawa Besar via Lombok to Bali. His board case was left in Lombok and involved considerable time and hassle to get back in Bali. I paid Rp 800 000 for two surfboards from Sumbawa Besar via Lombok to Bali. One of my boards arrived with damage. Communication - We first attempted to travel from Bali to Sumbawa Besar on Monday 18/7/16. There were legitimate reasons for flights to be delayed that day – some repairs were being made to the runway. The level of frustration and angst at the gates being used by Wings Air was fuelled by a lack of communication and miscommunication. After several hours of seeking information, we were told that our 3pm flight would leave at 6.45pm. We sought confirmation of this on a further four occasions as we were keen to not miss our flight. When 6:45pm came we went to the gate to check what was happening to be told that our flight (and our surfboards) had already left at 5.10pm. A number of other passengers were also left stranded by this action. We went to the Wings Air/Lion Air office to work out how we could now get to Sumbawa Besar, and how we could ensure the security of our four surf bags with 11 surf boards. We were amazed to find that Wings Air tried to make us pay for new flights as we had “failed to turn up to the gate” for our flight (even though we were only sitting 10m away, having been assured again that our flight would not leave until 6.45pm).",False,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DPS to SWQ via LOP,July 2016,3,3,,1,1,,False,
