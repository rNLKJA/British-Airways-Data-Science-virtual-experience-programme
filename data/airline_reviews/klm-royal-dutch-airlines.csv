"""KLM refuses to compensate me""",1,2022-11-10,"Worst airline experience ever. I was on a business trip in Spain. On Jun 28, 2022, I was scheduled to fly KL2648 from Malaga to Amsterdam, and then to LA, with a couple of hours layover. 4 days prior to my flight, I received an email from KLM saying my flight was canceled. They then scheduled me to a different flight a day early (and at a different time).  I couldn’t leave a day early, due to my business obligations, so I spent hours each day trying to reach the airline. However, KLM's customer service was not reachable and the website wasn't functioning. On the top of all of that, I kept receiving confusing emails from KLM saying my original flight was still on time, while, at the same time that flight had changed. So I had to go to the airport one day prior to my original flight to find out if my trip actually changed or not. Upon arriving at the airport, I was told by a rude KLM employee that I must fly now or I will lose my ticket. I was also promised that I will be taken care of by a KLM employees in Amsterdam. I arrived at the Amsterdam airport after 1am, and there were no KLM employees there at all. I then had to spend a frustrating night looking for a place to stay because all the hotels were fully booked. KLM does not care about their passengers, and they don't take any responsibility when there’s a problem for which they are responsible. It's been 5 months now that I have been trying to get a refund for my reasonable expenses (as they promise to pay), but KLM refuses to compensate me, even though I have proof for every transaction.

Perhaps some background to some of the bad reviews is in order. Many of these bad reviews are about KLM customer care and Schiphol airport handling. During the pandemic, Schiphol in its infinite wisdom thought it wise to lay off much of the security personnel even when the Dutch government provided for subsidies for companies not to fire employees. Equally with the baggage handling companies, whose personnel is not well paid unfortunately anyway. Now with air traffic resuming to pre-pandemic levels, that same personnel is impossible to come by. Of course they have found more reliable employers as there is a general labour shortage anyway. As a result and to be fair, KLM is caught in the middle. KLM has had to drastically cut back on flights and occupancy, in a time where it was hoping to make up lost revenue during the pandemic.

Dessert was handed out later, a tasteless yellow cake in a plastic wrap. The cutlery is now made of flat balsa-like wood, stamped into shapes of knife, fork and spoon. Like eating with hospital tongue depressors. The second meal was unidentifiable .. a boiling hot piece of a pizza like sandwich with no discernable filling, and a sloppy salad, beige and liquid with nothing really to tell what it was.

My travel partner spent hours on the phone with KLM sine I was working - she would be put on hold 15 minutes at a time by the agent who was nothing but rude and unhelpful and she was told vague different reasons for the flight changes from different employees. It seemed like they were trying to get rid of us or it was a hassle to assist us. KLM offered to place us on new flights that were not reasonable and eventually after hours agreed there were no reasonable flights and would refund us our tickets. We then had to rebook our flights which cost more as we were now only 3 weeks away from leaving and took us on a completely different flight path. This caused us to have to cancel hotels and re-book others. On top of this we were informed our refund of about $1400 would take 3-5 MONTHS!

The seat in economy comfort, ample leg room, but horrible comfort after 6 hrs. you do not know how to sit comfortable. Just after the start you get bottle of Spa water with a small package containing a small tissue to clean your hands, it is the only one you get during the flight. Thereafter you have to wait 1-1,5 hrs. to get your 'exquisite' dinner, a choice between vegetarian or chicken, this is served with a large basket which seems to be a salad, all served on a tray with non-slippery top side, which tends to move over your seat table as no anti-slip is installed under tray. so you have risk that your complete meal including beverage ends up in your lap, Regarding the taste of the food served, the chicken meal is neutral/ ok, but not very tasteful, the salad which seems to be a highflyer by KLM, is too awful to further describe, it tastes horrible, KLM should be ashamed to serve this to customers. the piece of bread which comes with dinner is though and hardly eatable, the piece of cheese sticks to its plastic packaging. The 'exquisite' dinner is served with one beverage, no further beverage service during or afterwards. After dinner you wait another 45 mins to get coffee and the famous cake, which KLM is proud to serve. This cake is very very sweet and again without any taste, except the sweet, overall it is just a tasteless piece of cake.

Delta was great with our first flight to Atlanta, and everything went downhill from there. When the time finally came to board our long flight with KLM, our excitement immediately fizzled. We arrived in Amsterdam and had a 24 hour layover, which we understand happens .... finally after trying to sleep in the airport overnight, it was time to board, at that time the staff announced our flight was delayed due to ""short platform staff"". After about 30-40 minutes they canceled it completely! At this time the staff at the gate would not help, we were sent across the airport, a good 10 minute speed walk, to a self serve kiosk to try to rebook our flight. After waiting an hour and a half in line, (as everyone booked on that plane had to do the same) we were sent an email of a rescheduled booking the airline made, without talking to us, for 2 DAYS later. We finally got to the beginning of the line to talk to someone and the only thing they did was give is a piece of paper with an email address to contact if we had any issues.

Midday on Dec 29 (ie less than 24 hours before departure) I got email that one of the flights (AMS-AAL) had been cancelled and that KLM were looking at options. We could not extend our hotel and could find no other hotel options in/near TOS (it is a relative small, and VERY remote town) so I immediately tried to contact KLM (Holland #) to determine flight options. I got an automated message that ""We have more than 45 min wait time; please try your call later"", and call was disconnected. For the rest of the day, I called about once an hour with same result. In the mean time (around 6pm) I got another automated email that they had rebooked my itinerary on Jan 2nd. This was complete useless for several reasons. There were no hotels to be had in TOS, and we had flight back to US on Jan 2nd that we would miss. Finally that evening I called KLM # in US and was put into a call que. After 1.5 hour wait (at huge long distance fee), I got through to an agent and explained situation, and the agent essentially said ""tough luck"". KLM would not help find hotels in TOS, nor help us get out of town; eg if KLM had left my first two flights intact we would get to AMS, with lot better chance of finding a hotel and there were several options to get to AAL from AMS the following day, but KLM would not budge. I then asked KLM to switch me to nearly destination airport (BLL instead of ALL) and we could take a 2 hour train ride from BLL to ALL. KLM's own system showed such a flight with 7 seats available on Dec 30. However, KLM wanted more than $1000/ticket to make the change. When I insisted that KLM do something to help us out - leaving us stranded in TOS for 2 days without hotel rooms, wasn't really an option, they hung up on me. In we end we ended up buying completely separate ticket on different airline (SAS) at $500/ticket for Dec 30, and we are now fighting with KLM about getting a refund, which a different (and also not a happy story) What really got to me, was that KLM had several good options that they would have deployed:  KLM had a flight on Dec 30 to a nearly airport that would work, but they wanted completely unrealistic change fee (around $1000/ticket). They could have put us on the Dec 30 SAS flight (cost about $500/ticket) - same flights that we purchased ourselves.

Lack of quality mitigated by quantity – liquid enough was present – even for the thirsty. I even had a shower and was given the amenities for it (towels, kit, etc.). Boarding included a ridiculous early call from the lounge to sit and stare in gate for 45 Minutes prior to an awkward, superfluous bus-gating for 300 meter, degrading business class feeling to cattle class.

Due to Covid checks we were advised to check in at least 3 hrs before our flight, but we were at the gate within 30 minutes. We decided to treat ourselves to lounge access for 100 euro in total. KLM's Crown Lounge is okay, but not sure I would do it again. Boarding in groups and punctual departure. Tasty meals - although a bit small - and enough drinks. I like the fact that they have a self service with drinks and snacks in the pantry. Very friendly crew. We were on the very last row in J and K, which is the only row in the 777 economy that had two seats. We liked that very much, because there is no-one beside you and you have more lag space. And in times of Covid at least it feels more safe since there is no-one behind you. Highly recommended! Quite a long trip to Bonaire since there is a stop in Aruba, but no big deal. Early landing in Bonaire and in about 30 minutes through customs despite Covid checks which were well arranged at the airport.

Eventually I went to the neighbouring line, supposed to be for another flight, where the staff I dealt with started to produce my boarding pass (all I needed!), but got distracted and left me. Another one finally gave me the boarding pass, and at this time all my delay margin had been used up, and I had to run through control and to the security at the (distant) gate, sweating, breaking my carrier bag, creating the worst possible start to a long, multi-stop journey. Every individual staff member I dealt with at the check-in desk was: rude, unhelpful, completely apathetic whether I caught my flight or not, unprofessionally having relaxed conversations with colleagues while ignoring passengers - all who were anxious directly because of them. The system itself must also be questioned where slower, bag-dropping passengers are queuing with those already checked in and are not expecting such a slow line. A group of kids ahead of me in the queue - who caused much of the delay - were fast-tracked to the gate, I wasn't given that option despite being behind them, and barely told which direction to walk in (getting a scoff when I asked). Again - the staff on board - fine, efficient and friendly and the service is good, and the pilot's communication excellent.

It is a small 2-wheeled suitcase, I have been using it for years, it has never been taken from me. That is, it was not prepared for this kind of transportation (it was not locked, for example). Of course, the flight was not fully booked at all, approx. 70-80% of the seats were occupied, and there's a lot of free luggage space in the cabin. Then the worst part ensued: it was an almost one-hour waiting in a aprrox. 150m-long queue at the gate D8 (the queue stared at D2) with the passengers of UK flights for checking our documents (covid tests, passenger locator forms, etc.). We were not informed at all about what would happen when the time of closing gate was coming. One of the few helpers from KLM told me that there's no any guarantee that I could reach my flight to Aberdeen. In the 45th mintue of my ""sojourn"" in this queue I got the first sms from KLM, that my flight's gate was closing... Finally, when I was already sure that I missed my connecting flight, another helper of KLM cried around for passengers to Aberdeen then we (approx. 15-20 of us) had to run after her to the gate.

"""lied to by a KLM representative who I put my trust in""",1,2021-09-01,"KLM put me through a real ordeal earlier this August. I had booked a flight to visit my family in Canada a month before my travel date of August 12th 2021. I started to prepare all the necessary documentation required for my entry to Calgary, Canada. Closer to the date of my departure, I had yet to receive my approval from the IRCC Canada to be able to enter the country. Wondering if I should postpone my flight dates, I called the KLM helpline, they were unable to give me any information and informed me that only the airport would be able to give me accurate information as to whether I could fly or not. After being told that I could get a full refund if they do not allow me to board the flight due to the COVID restrictions, I would be able to get a full refund on my full purchased ticket. With this information, I packed my bags and headed to the airport with plenty of time to spare, in case anything were to go wrong. Once at the KLM check-in desk, at the Dubai Airport, I handed all the documentation I had and the KLM representative started the process of printing the boarding passes. I interrupted him and mentioned that I did not have the approval from the IRCC which was stated as a requirement on their ""travel doc"" site. He assured me that I would not need it, I told him to please check for me to make sure, because I did not want to be stranded anywhere, he got up of his seat and proceeded to a team leader or a manager on duty and then assured me again that I would be able to fly and would not have any issues transiting through Amsterdam or entering Canada. With this information, I was very relieved and informed him that I was not prepared to fly today as I thought that that would be a requirement, but just for the sake of trying I decided to get the information first hand at the airport. He then mentioned to me that there was not a problem because I have all the other documentation which are important except for the approval which is fine. Long story short, once I arrived at my point of transit Amsterdam, they did not let me board the flight to Calgary, and informed me that I needed the IRCC approval to get on the plane. Completely distraught and disappointed, I took the next flight back to Dubai, leaving an hour later. That was how I spent my entire day, was lied to by a KLM representative who I put my trust in, and stuck on a plane for over 13 hours with over 5 hours of layover. When I decided to take up the matter with KLM customer care, they admitted to their mistake but still refused to give me a full refund for my full ticket flight that was completely wasted. I spent a total of AED 4,955 for the flight which was not returned. I then had to spend a lot more money trying to book a last minute flight to Calgary with another airline once the approval came out.

"""the whole catastrophe""",1,2021-08-20,"Not Verified |  My 10 month old baby and I had to fly from Manchester to Toronto and we connected in Amsterdam. Before getting on the plane, we handed over my baby's stroller which was supposed to meet us at our connection in Amsterdam, however it never did. The flight attendants were amazing (the only good part of the experience) and tried to help us find it, even the pilot himself came to try and help, however he informed us that someone made a mistake and never put a tag on the stroller so it went straight through to Toronto. This was just the first bump in the whole catastrophe that was my experience with KLM. I then had to carry my 10 month old along with my bag throughout the airport and wait for our next flight. Anyone with a baby can respect that workout. I was a bit upset but understood that things happen. We finally got on our plane to Toronto and after a very long day we go to get our bags and as soon as I saw the stroller bag a KLM employee walked over to me because he could see that our stroller bag was ripped to shreds. As soon as I took the stroller out it appeared as though it was hit by a car. The wheels were barely holding on, the frame was bent and even her car seat and adaptors were broken and would no longer connect into the stroller or car seat base. This bag was clearly thrown around enough that even her blanket which was inside the car seat was ripped. This was my first time ever flying with my daughter. It was stressful enough without all of this happening but again I understand that these things can happen. The KLM employee had me fill out paperwork and explain what each product was and an estimate of how much they were. He provided me with a number which later on, proved to be useless. They said to call KLM when I got home to quarantine (Canada 2 week mandatory quarantine). I called KLM when I got home and explained everything. They told me I would be contacted in 2 days. 2 days passed and still nothing so I called again. I then got a manager named Rocky who told me I would be contacted in a week. Once again, I was never contacted. I then called again and pressed the prompt to see the status of the claim and I was put on the phone with a man. The only thing he was able to do was give me the claim number that I had already provided him with. He said that he was in sales (I don't know why that prompt brought me to sales) and told me that I needed to get in touch with customer service. I asked him if he could forward me to them and he said he was not able to. I then asked if I could speak to a manager and he said he did not know who his manager was. Keep in mind each time I called I was on hold for 2-3+ hours. And multiple times I was on hold for 3 hours or more and they would hang up. I could honestly go on forever about all of the specific things that this company did but to avoid writing a novel here ... long story short I did not hear back until more than a month later.

Instead of being contacted, I received an email that the money was transferred to my old bank account. I contacted my old bank immediately and they explained to me that if an amount gets sent to a non-existing bank account, it automatically returns to the sender account within few days. I have been in contact with KLM service agents via chat and explained the situation, asking them to process another refund. They asked for a document certifying that my old bank account is closed and that my old credit card doesn't function. I provided them with this document, issued from my old bank. Afterwards, they didn't process a new refund as they said they will, instead they told me that sometimes it could take up to 2 months for the amount that was sent to my closed bank account to return to them and that I will receive the amount on my new bank account after 2 months. 2 months have passed on the 5/08 and I have received nothing from them, no refund, no email informing me about the refund being processed.

Then you have to wait for another day for them to reply to your next message. When they do so, they ask the same questions that were already answered by me one day ago, leaving me with the impression that they haven't red the previous text messages.

"""KLM has certainly been a mixed bag""",7,2021-05-26,"Flying with KLM has certainly been a mixed bag. I was initially due to fly on May 25th, but due to issues with my Covid-19 test, KLM rescheduled me onto the May 26th flight for free which was great! The check-in staff for KLM at Incheon airport were awful, however. Despite my final destination being Manchester, the check-in lady refused to send my bag there. I explained to her that I cannot leave airside in the Netherlands as I do not have a visa, therefore I need my bag to be sent to Manchester. She didn’t care and simply had it unloaded in Amsterdam. As a result, I ended up in Manchester without my bag and had to speak to a member of staff to organise delivery of my bag from Amsterdam to my home address in the U.K. Here’s hoping it will arrive tomorrow... The KLM staff in Amsterdam were a direct contrast of the staff at Incheon. They were so kind, considerate and very willing to help in any way they could which was wonderful to see, especially as travelling has now become so much more complex and daunting. The cabin crew onboard both KLM flights were also fantastic. Very warm, welcoming and accommodating. It was great to see social distancing being observed as much as possible on both flights and standards of cleanliness onboard seemed high. Food options on the initial ICN - Amsterdam leg were not great. Everyone received a pot of fruit, a yoghurt and a pastry towards the end of the flight with some juices, tea and coffee. This was the only food service available on the 11 hour flight which was disappointing.

"""Poor communication, poor customer service, lack of information""",3,2021-04-21,"I had other choices, but because of past pleasant experiences and the good reputation of KLM, I chose this. I realize that travel during COVID is complicated, and KLM surely made it even more so. Please let me outline my major issues: 1) First, I had trouble in the weeks leading up to my travel finding out what tests I needed to transit through Amsterdam and how I could get a PCR test that was given on 72 hours before landing in Amsterdam, yet be sure that I would receive the results on time. I realize that this is not KLM’s rule, but the people at KLM were not very helpful in guiding me on how to do this. I was told, “Other people do it, so you figure it out.” I was able to get more information from Delta. 2) The day before I left, I got an email that my flight from Amsterdam to Bahrain had been cancelled and I was rerouted through London. That was also what was shown on the KLM website, however, the Delta website had the original itinerary on it. When I got to the airport to check in, I was assured that my flight from Amsterdam to Bahrain had not been cancelled. To be sure, I asked the gate agent when I got to the gate. I was again told that I was on the originally booked flight from Amsterdam to Bahrain. However, when I arrived in Amsterdam, I found that was not the case. 3) There was no one to greet those of us on the canceled flight and tell us what to do - no signs, no guidance at all. 4) Being unable to check in at the automated site, after several attempts, I found that I had to go to the KLM transit office. The KLM person there asked for my COVID test results, and I showed her the printout of the result I had received. She said it was unacceptable! It was the official result that had been downloaded from the website, but she kept telling me it was unacceptable.Then, she told me I needed a copy of the visa to get into Bahrain, I always get the visa when I get there. She then told me that I did not have the correct paperwork to go through England. I was tired and frustrated. KLM sent me through London, then tells me I don’t have the correct paperwork to go through London! I had a copy of the quick COVID test that I had done Monday morning with my doctor’s signature, and she finally accepted that. I got my colleague at Arabian Gulf University to send me an electronic copy of the visa, and she accepted that. Then, before boarding, KLM agents wanted to see my COVID test results again. Fearing the same response, I also showed them my vaccination card that showed I had gotten two doses of Moderna in February. I was finally allowed to board the plane. Poor communication, poor customer service, lack of information. 5) When I got to London, I had no problems with my Corona Test Result report downloaded from the internet, and they did not ask for the visa. Poor communication. 6) When I arrived in Bahrain the day after I was supposed to arrive, my luggage was not there. Several passengers, those of us who were rerouted through London, did not have our luggage. I filed a missing luggage report. 7) I didn't get my luggage for two days, and I had to go pick it up from the airport.

"""I begged for an answer once, twice, thrice""",1,2021-04-16,"This was, hands down, the most out-of-this-world idiotic experience I’ve had in quite some time. I have contacted CS because KLM has allowed me to book and pay for a flight they then showed canceled in the confirmation page. Was this designed to trick me into paying for something that isn’t available to then rebook me on an option nobody wants, perhaps. Or perhaps it was an issue of the internal system not correctly showing customers real-time information. In either case, it’s their fault and it felt irritating. The agent offered me a second option which I confirmed I wanted, proceeded to book me, and then two seconds later informed me that that flight too was canceled. Either a sick joke, I thought to myself, or complete incompetence. However, the agent then came up with a list of other options, all that were not ok for me because were arriving either too late in the night or they had me sitting 7+ hours in layover. At one point, however, they came up with an option that was more than impossible and then simply proceeded to book me and send me a confirmation without waiting for me to even reply. Why I say this option was impossible is because the connection flight was leaving at 10.40 while the first flight there leaving after that, at 14.40. You then understand how it’s impossible for me to bend physics and time and space continuum, to catch a flight that leaves hours after I’m supposed to catch my second. Total insanity. Upon insistent questioning I didn’t get even one apology, but a passive-aggressive message informing me to make up my mind quickly because all the available flights get booked quickly. The option the agent had next for me was a flight that seemed familiar, until I realized it was the exact flight they offered the second time - the flight that they booked and then informed me it was already canceled. So this person was offering to book me on a canceled flight, once more. This, my dear reader, is when I lost the will to live in this nightmare. I asked them if they were simply mocking me at this point. I begged for an answer once, twice, thrice, as they weren’t answering my messages at this point. After about 45 min the agent comes back, untroubled and provides me with another 2 options - one of which was again not possible due to limitations in the fabric of space and time. I gave up and agreed to one of the options that required me to spend 5 hours in layover, thinking it’s better than the rest of eternity in this purgatory.

"""our booking had not been paid for""",1,2021-04-09,"We booked two business class seats for travel on January 7th from DPS to SIN and return SIN to DPS on the 9th of January. Payment was by bank transfer and received 2 immediate confirmations; an email from Permata Bank confirming that the money was transferred successfully to KLM's bank account; the 2nd email was from KLM with booking confirmation (UKLFCP) complete with seat numbers (1A and 1C). We got to the airport (DPS) at 7pm for a 9.30pm departure, only to be told on check-in that our booking had 'not been paid for'. We showed the check-in staff our booking confirmation and the email + text from our bank confirming that the payment had been received by KLM. After being refused travel, we called the duty manager at DPS , who appeared to take great delight as he told us we 'didn't have a ticket'. We showed him our payment confirmation and booking confirmation, which mentions ticket conditions, etc. Yet he refused to allow us to check-in. We asked him to call KLM in Holland but instead he called Air France who could not help. By this point, we had been at the customer service desk for more than an hour and a half and were unable to reach a single KLM staff member other than the passive-aggressive station manager who told us that the only way we could travel on the flight was to buy two more economy tickets (business class was full). He told us to try and book the flight online on our phones which we tried to do, having absolutely no choice to not travel (my husband's Indonesian visa meant that he had to leave Bali on the 7th, or face a hefty fine. We also had an appointment at the Indonesian embassy to get our permanent residency for Indonesia). At the same time, our phone showed that KLM was still advertising business class seats on the same flight! We tried to book those but KLM's online payment facility failed. We asked the station manager if he would let us pay for those business class seats which were still being advertised online through the customer service desk (remember we had already paid for two business class return tickets). The station manager refused to let us do that and forced us to buy two economy return tickets, for 13,501,200 RP. Our original payment for the two return business class tickets on Dec 21st was 14,340,800 Rupiah (over $1000 USD). To add insult to injury, as we were leaving the desk, we asked for a pass to the lounge to grab a quick drink and perhaps a sandwich (we'd been at the desk now for almost 2 hours). The staff said, 'you are traveling in economy'. During this process, we sent several requests for help via the KLM WhatsApp number; sending them copies of our proof of payment and booking confirmation. They did not respond for almost 2 hours and when they did, they told us that the case had been 'resolved' at the check-in desk, which of course it had not. We purchased business class tickets on Garuda to travel back from SIN. We launched a complaint to KLM. On February 18th, KLM offered us €600 euros compensation each, but on February 19th, we received the following email from KLM customer services agent  'Regarding the Denied Boarding Compensation, the legislation does not apply for trips out of Europe (DPS-SIN).

"""wasn't at all what we had booked""",1,2021-04-03,"Not Verified |  On January 24 we booked a trip on KLM from Bergen, Norway to Barcelona, Spain, for travel on September 2. We booked long ahead of our travel dates to get a good schedule at a good price. Our trip was KLM 1188, departing Bergen at 2:10pm and arriving in Amsterdam at 3:55pm, and KLM 1675, leaving at 4:45pm, and arriving in Barcelona at 6:50pm. We expected to have a nice, leisurely morning before heading to the airport. However, on March 30, we received two emails indicating that our flights had been changed. The first email stated that we were being changed from KLM 1675 to KLM 1681, leaving Amsterdam at 8:35pm and arriving in Barcelona at 10:45pm, making it impossible to make any connection to our final destination. Our layover in Amsterdam was changed from 50 minutes (a little short, but it's what we chose) to 4 hours and 40 minutes. Then, 90 minutes later, the second email stated that we had been changed from KLM 1188 to KLM 1186, leaving Bergen at 11:35am and arriving in Amsterdam at 1:20pm. Now we were not only arriving in Barcelona quite late, but our layover was changed to 7 hours and 15 minutes. This wasn't at all what we had booked, and was the first instance of poor customer support -- and we only chose KLM on Travelocity because it met our needs, not because of a specific desire to fly that airline. Unfortunately, due to other obligations, I studied KLM's flight choices on April 2, three days later, and tried to change my flights at that time. Travelocity assisted at this point, for quite a long time, but ran into problems with KLM. I stated that the first flight was acceptable, but that we'd prefer the second flight be changed to KLM 1673, departing Amsterdam at 2:15pm. This would change our layover in Amsterdam to 55 minutes, and restore the trip duration to something very similar to our original trip. Instead, KLM decided that our original flight was most comparable (in price or class) to a flight leaving at 6:05am! They would only change our tickets to KLM 1184 leaving Bergen at 6:05, and KLM 1669 leaving Amsterdam after a 2 1/2 hour layover. (And, they charged a few dollars per ticket, extra, for the privilege of this horrible start time, and longer trip.) I was informed after the fact, by Travelocity, that I should have contacted an airline within a day of being notified of unacceptable flight changes (and I'll do so in the future!), but this wasn't my highest priority in those few days. What's most irritating, however, is that not only did KLM somehow think that changing a trip duration from less than 5 hours to more than 11 hours was ""reasonable"", but that the final resolution of moving a flight from 2pm to 6am was all that was offered. I'd heard that KLM was a decent airline, and we'll find out for ourselves in September, but this customer experience makes it very unlikely that they'll get our business for any of our future travels.",False,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bergen to Barcelona via Amsterdam,April 2021,,,,,2,,,False

However, KLM's ground staff in Mexico City asked me if I had a mask (ignoring that I was very obviously wearing one), and when I asked to clarify, they incorrectly claimed that KLM requires FFP2 medical masks to be worn.

In challenging times such as the COVID pandemic, it is more important than ever to know the rules and to be respectful to customers, which KLM didn't do.

(3) KLM Crown Lounge 25 in the Amsterdam airport had a sign that it was closed at 2 pm. My flight arrived at 3 pm and I had a connection time of almost 6 hours. (By the way, the airside hotel YOTELAIR did not have any short term stays available, and Aspire Lounge 26 only allows access three hours before a flight.) As a result, I had to walk around the airport and sit in crowded areas, which is not good in terms of social distancing.

As i knew the lounges were probably closed and I didn't want to subject myself to a COVID-19 potential in a large airport for an entire day, I was obviously not at all pleased with this change. As I had bought the ticket from Air France, I called them directly and after explaining my distinct unhappiness with this change, which was a fault of the scheduling change, and not from my side, was offered another option of going with KLM instead of Delta and this would reduce my layover in Atlanta to 4 hours, so I decided to change to this option, especially since the business class flight being offered ha the same seating configuration as my original booking, which was in a configuration of 1x2x1. I specifically asked for confirmation of this and it was confirmed by the AF agent and they put me in the same seat number of 4A and I had double checked again when checking in was still accurate. When I boarded the plane in Atlanta, I was shocked and dismayed to see that the configuration of the plane was 2 - 3 - 2 instead and there was never any notification about this. They had still kept my boarding card at 4A but now there was a 4B next to me and what's worse, the entire business class section was packed with passengers, offering no social distancing whatsoever, and the person next to me had brought in a greasy back of food from one of the fast food restaurants and I had that smell with me the entire journey from Atlanta to Amsterdam, and in my clothes the remainder of the following day. Also there was no real food service, only a terrible pasta dish (economy fare) and soggy sandwich dropped on my seat later on, only served water and flight attendants literally disappeared.

They gave no excuse why COVID-19 caused an aircraft change and them not dutifully informing me, why it was so full with no social distancing possible, why no drink service apart from water was offered, and why flight attendants disappeared. I got nowhere with them and gave up finally vowing never to darken the door again with them. I had traveled to the US with Delta Airlines from Amsterdam, and they were 100X better, and they have implemented a block middle seat policy in all classes of travel to assure social distancing.

If KLM had allowed me to reschedule and if they had kept their daily service up to 28/03/2020, I and numerous other KLM customers could have safely travelled with KLM. 4. I am of the opinion that the reasons behind the cancellation were purely financial; KLM calculated it was cheaper to cancel the tickets outstanding rather than send aircraft to Malaysia to pick up the passengers (many of whom would have very cheap tickets).

Especially considering KLM is not a low-cost carrier, I would have never expected to pay extra for checked luggage on an international flight with KLM (or with any other carrier for that matter). When I performed the reservation process, at no time did I see a clear and visible placard stating that baggage was not included in the fare. This should have, in the first place, been clearly stated when I was searching for the price of tickets through KLM. I found out that my luggage had to be paid for at Helsinki airport when I went to drop it off. Furthermore, the fact that checked luggage was not included was also not clear during the on-line check-in process (because I could have corrected it there and paid for it). This is misleading and shows poor business practices on the part of KLM, tricking their customers into viewing low fares that so not include something as basic as checked luggage.

You might only get a couple of inches extra leg room, but it is surprising the difference this can make. Other than the extra leg room/greater seat recline, the service on board is the same as standard economy. The meals on the flight were very good as too was the overall cabin service. In flight entertainment was also good, with enough content to keep you entertained. In summary, our flight to Amsterdam, in Economy Comfort Class, was very good and I managed to get some sleep. Overall, I think it was well worth the extra cost. For our flight from Amsterdam to Rome, there is little to report, given that it is considered a short, domestic flight in Europe. The service was good. No in flight entertainment. A snack was served on the flight. The cabin staff were friendly and efficient.

"""a bit of a disappointment""",6,2018-11-19,"Overall this is a bit of a disappointment I have to say. I upgraded with SkyTeam miles (89,900 miles to be precise) from Buenos Aires to Amsterdam (my full itinerary was Santiago de Chile-Edinburgh, but only the previous segment got upgraded). I have been a customer of AF/KLM for well over 10 years, and have never been offered an upgrade or anything, which I believe says a lot about how they value their loyal customers. For this upgrade, I had to repeatedly ask the purser on Santiago-Buenos, then ground staff, before finally getting an answer! Which is still better than when you ask on Messenger or WhatsApp, and they just say 'no' without any kind of explanation--this also needs improving. Anyway, preamble over and onto the product itself. I was in seat 1 C, which had a not very charming view of a corridor leading to the flight deck, past the kitchen etc. There was also some foot traffic around here. There are only 2 toilets for the whole of Biz class on this plane, this is too little as there were queues, and also the toilets are no different from Economy, I believe they should have special touch to justify the increased cost. The seat had some pros, one being turning into lie-flat bed and various other comfy positions; there was a 17 inch IFE screen, but I didn't use it. The blanket was warm enough, and the pillow of good size. I did find the seat a bit dirty (lots of crumbs on the side) and scuffed in some areas. There was also too little storage space (I like having phone, tablets, headphones etc. in easy reach and there was barely enough space for that). The most annoying is the absence of direct aisle access, meaning the person next to you has to step over you or wake you up to get to bathroom etc. This is a big minus in terms of convenience/privacy. The staff were generally helpful, friendly and efficient, though they should come by more often to offer drinks etc. I got extremely dehydrated at one point. The food I'd say was average: a starter of prawns was tasty (though very few prawns!), while the beef mains was chewy and bland; the dessert was dry, and the cheese selection was very limited and not that tasty. There were some good wines (though a limited range), a very tasty cocktail (but awful, dry and not fresh nuts!). The breakfast was certainly better than in economy but a bit so-so too. Coffee was tasty enough. Good touch in terms of cutlery and crockery design, especially the Delft porcelain-style mugs and bowls, very pretty. The little present a Dutch house model filled with Gin, to take home and collect (there are 99 in total) is a sweet touch. Overall, I would keep my miles and spend them on a better business class.

We bought the flight tickets for us both 8 months before the wedding and immediately asked KLM customer service if we could transport the wedding dress with us on board (it couldn't be sent as a luggage, because a) it would be destroyed and b) it could go missing because we had to change planes on our way). Customer service answered that yes, it's not a problem, we just need to send the exact dimensions of the dress a few days before the flight. We sent this information 3 weeks before our flight - and then it turned out that our request to take the dress has been denied because it was ""too big"". Of course before no one informed us that they would accept it just if it fits to a given sizes! Very upset and angry, we decided to buy an extra seat for the dress (which, because the flight was so already so close, turned out to be more expensive than the tickets for both of us together!) And then our request was denied once more. The reason: the dress is TOO FRAGILE. They suggested we put it into the luggage. You see, it was too fragile for onboard but apparently not too fragile to be sent with the luggage even though everyone knows how the airlines treat your luggage! Then we told them it's ridiculous and sent the request for buying the extra seat again, and again we were denied! This time they said that the dress is ""too big"" (even though it was smaller and much lighter than e.g. musical instruments, which KLM allows to transport!) We have requested again and again have been denied that it's too big and then we requested again, promising that we gonna bend it three times, so it will be smaller (which of course we were not going to do, because then the dress would be completely destroyed!) - and then finally we were allowed to buy our overpriced seat. Of course, when we were actually flying, the crew was surprised that we had been forced to buy an extra seat - because they were immediately offering us space in the storage closet, which we had requested at the very beginning! And of course no one was trying to force us to bend the dress and of course the dress fit the seat perfectly and wasn't disturbing anyone. What I do not understand, is: what do the people who make such decisions at KLM have against weddings? Why did they force us to go through all that unnecessary stress just before our wedding? The crews and the people from the customer service were really nice - why some decision making clerk, hiding behind the firewall of the customer service, was trying to make our life so unnecessarily miserable?

She basically giggled and said ""what do you expect me to do or say about it"" that is not how you deal with a problem, especially not when you are a customer service manager. (they get trained for these situations) She went to the man and told him carefully about the smell and asked him ""could you please put your shoes in a plastic bag"" and left it at that. It didn't make it any better as the smell was coming from his dirty feet and socks too! After about 20min the smell still hadn't gone and when the purser walked by I told her that it still smells really bad. She said ""the gentleman had put the shoes in a plastic bag"" when I said it is not only his shoes that were the problem but also his socks and feet she basically gave me an angry look and walked away not to been seen for the rest of the flight.

It is a long haul flight and to sit in that smell for that amount of time is unacceptable, especially if you have paid almost 900 euros for a ticket. I am very disappointed with this service.

No explanation was given and there was no attempt to serve business class passengers using economy class check in. The Skyteam lounge in T4 was also very poor. It is a very boring and dated lounge and the F&B offers weren’t great. It was far inferior to the Plaza Premium lounge on the other side of the airport. It was very disappointing to see a substandard Skyteam lounge considering they have so many flights out of T4. The service inflight is what really makes KLM a reputable airlines. The crew were chatty and extremely friendly. Everyone received a warm welcome – not only for business class passengers. Breakfast served was decent – fresh juice, good quality yoghurt and warm pastry. Returning journey was as good as outbound. Skyteam (KLM) lounge 52 was large but very basic considering its KLM’s hub. It felt like a waiting room in a large train station. Gate at Schiphol was crowded and boarding was late, but ground staff were friendly. Crew in the cabin again was first class and very elegant.

Eventually, we did continue our trip after a lot of welcome help from Delta and a lot of personal cost borne by us. The true worth of an airline shows up when things do not go to script.

You may find yourself in a position of receiving a email or notice on KLM's app that you can upgrade to a economy comfort or business class seat for anything between 50 Euros to 500 Euros. A word of warning if you do. 1- If you upgrade from your original seat and pay between 50 Euros to 500 Euros for the upgrade and then have your flight cancelled KLM will rebook your flights back to the original seat class only with no automatic refund on your upgrade. You have to go through a 2 week refund process which you have to initiate by applying for first with no guarantee of a refund at the end! You will be told ""the reason we could not rebook your upgraded seat is because these are not available on your rebooked flight"". But when I logged on to KLM's website or App I notice that the upgraded seats are still available. Only this time they are substantially more expensive to upgrade to, because they know that there are more people willing to upgrade because of the cancelled flights. If like me you check the upgrade as soon as you get your ticket and find the highest upgrade available is a economy comfort seat and you pay for that upgrade as soon as you can you may find yourself in a sticky situation if business class becomes available closer to departure time and you upgrade further. Because, and I quote a customer services rep on the phone ""It is KLM's policy not to refund any earlier upgrade to economy comfort if you then upgrade to business class"". KLM has already failed to honour your original upgrade from the day before, failed to give you a automatic refund and will keep your money for 14 days and then hiked the price of that upgrade to around $100 more for the same flight the next day. And now are refusing to give a refund for a lesser upgrade booked earlier which has been superseded by paying the premium price for business class upgrade.

The plane out of Houston has an issue, KLM needs to get it fixed. Paperworks and repairs take 4 hours. Most passengers already miss the connecting flights before departure.

"""hope for a journey without the complications""",3,2017-11-03,"✅ Verified Review |  
My customer journey with KLM left an incredible impact that marketing specialists can only dream of. It kept going on for over a month longer than my actual journey with KLM and created a number of lasting memories. The actual journey, however, never quite unfolded its full potential like a butterfly that's stuck in his cocoon. What a shame, I've heard many others say that KLM is a great airline. I can only verify this partially as out of the 4 flights I booked with KLM, I ended up only taking one. Here is why: One day before my departure from Berlin to Osaka, I received news that my connecting flight from Amsterdam to Osaka was cancelled. During the darkest hours of the night, some courageous customer service worker managed to put me on a Finnair flight which turned out to be a more than decent replacement. However, my chance to experience the Dutch Air Hospitality that KLM is renowned for was delayed. Talking about delayed, let me tell you the story of my flight home. The long haul from Osaka to Amsterdam was the only one out of the 4 KLM flights that I ended up taking. Once you manage to actually catch a KLM flight that's not cancelled, you receive warm and friendly service by the crew, decent-tasting food and a wide range of the latest cinematic enterainment options plus games and series. They even had some automatic kind of window blinds that turned the windows into a dark shade of blue (instead of the typical plastic blinds you get). This was very nice. I only wish I'd stayed up in the air for longer because as soon as we touched down in Amsterdam Schiphol, the chaos resumed. My flight to Berlin-Tegel was cancelled and I had to search for a replacement along with the numbers of other passengers who experienced a similar fate on that day. I arrived at Schiphol at 2 pm. The following hours included: me waiting in line - me being booked on a Lufthansa flight - being sent back from Lufthansa boarding because my name didn't get forwarded to Lufthansa - waiting in line again - being put on the waiting list for the KLM flight to Berlin later that evening - being sent back from boarding again because I didn't make it off the waiting list into the plane. Gotta mention that the customer service at Schiphol was very helpful the whole time, going through all possible options with me (I was disappointed that a rental car wasn't one, though!). You should have seen the look on the lady's face when I came back after the second failed connection around 9 pm. After 7 hours of from-A-to-B at Schiphol I resigned and agreed to a train connection the next morning and a hotel stay. These worked out. Unfortunately, my backpack got stuck in the loop at Schiphol and couldn't be given to me while I was there. It had to be claimed as ""missing"" and mailed to my address afterwards. Turns out the claim became real. My backpack really went missing and I had to wait 3 more weeks for it until receiving basically my whole wardrobe and souvenirs. Now that I am writing this, the compensation for products I had to buy as replacements for my delayed baggage has finally been paid (without problems) and I feel like my soul is finally at peace with this adventurous episode of being a KLM customer. When time has done its job mending the wounds, I will not hesitate to give KLM a second try. Looking forward to this future experience, a part of me hopes for another story to tell. Most of me however just hopes for a journey without the complications of this one.",False,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin Tegel to Osaka via Amsterdam,September 2017,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",2,3,,,True

The outbound flight from Amsterdam to Billund was with a KLM mainline Boeing 737, nothing special, on time departure and arrival with the standard onboard service of a coffee and a snack. The return flight, in this case the very last Fokker 70 flight from Billund to Amsterdam ever started as a complete let-down at the gate, business as usual, just a bunch of absolutely unfriendly gate agents. However when boarding the aircraft everything changed totally. The aircraft cabin was decorated with little flags and once all passengers boarded, the captain entered the cabin and welcomed all passengers and explained why this flight was a special event. It was also the entire crew's last flight on the Fokker 70. Upon departure to the main runway we received a water salute from the Billund fire brigade, followed by a very powerful take-off and a low-level bye bye pass over the airport. Onboard service during the flight was standard but the cabin crew did everything to make the flight memorable, well done! Landing in Amsterdam was on the rarely used Eastern runway which is the runway used in the past by the Fokker company to test fly and deliver their aircraft to their customers.

First thing we rang lastminute.com  to ask the costs for changing flights and get advice on the best options if it didn't arrive, after being on hold for a whole 60 minutes they said not their problem they wont help and we need to ring KLM . So we rang KLM and the first person said they didnt know how much but it wouldn't be a problem to change and they would email the details through, so we waited a while. Then rang KLM again who said not sure whats happening but they would email again, then they of course didnt. Then rang KLM again who said not their problem we should ring last minute.com Long story short we bounced between lastminute.com and KLM and not a single person we spoke to would help us or point us in the right direction.

"""loyal customer with no extra benefits""",1,2017-10-06,"✅ Verified Review |  Bahrain to Cardiff via Amsterdam. As customers we have to except that cancellations do happen & that more often than not the decision to cancel is taken with our safety in mind. Every airline can run well under normal circumstances but a good test of a airline is to see how they cope with situations like these. KLM were aware of bad weather & by the time my flight had arrived had already cancelled a lot of flights, with this in mind you would of thought that a large business would ensure that they have enough staff on hand not only in the airport but also online & on the end of the phone to cope with the very predictable customer demand that would inevitably ensue. Not the case with KLM. Arrived in Amsterdam to a flight board of mostly delayed or cancelled flights, then had to virtually beg to get into the Crown Lounge with a Petroleum card despite being fully entitled to enter, I was later told that KLM staff were trying to reduce the amount of people in the lounge due to the cancellations. What is the point of issuing loyal customers with a privilege card if you are not prepared to give them the privilege in the first place? Upon being emailed & texted that my flight was cancelled I was given a link to click to re-arrange my flight, brilliant I thought, not brilliant as the link took me to a blank page. Not a problem I will go to the customer service desk & sort this. I (together with a lot of other people) had to wait for over 1hr and 30mins just to be seen, by which time all other seats were taken & waiting lists were at least ten deep for that days remaining flights. Not a problem, as I (& many others) hold a privilege card this takes my to the front of the ""waiting list"" for last minute seats, this is one of the major selling point of the privilege card system. But apparently when you most need this service KLM are not ready to honour it, leaving you as a loyal customer with no extra benefits that KLM had previously promised you in order to get your business & loyalty in the first place. 3 hours later I managed to re-book my flight, 5 hours later I managed to get to the hotel, to be far after this everything seems to be running ok. However, when you compare this airline to how other airlines cope with disruption KLM falls well short of just achieving basic organisation let alone good customer service. When you have your flight cancelled with KLM you will receive a voucher for 15 euros off inflight duty free which was not valid on my flight as my flight is under 70 minutes in duration. Or 2000 air miles credited to your account but only after you learn to read Dutch to decipher the voucher you have been given & then post in all your boarding passes & receipts to a international address, which will probably cost you the same in postage as the miles are worth. This is after you have tried to re-book your flight using one of the three online services they advertise, non of them worked & no response was received from any for over 12 hours.

The electronic dimmable shades do work, mood lighting is nice and cabin noise is relatively low. In my opinion the biggest advantage of the 787 is the increased humidity compared to older aircraft. Nice IFE touch screen. However, if you look at the details my previous A350 flights with Singapore Airlines scored better on almost every aspect. KLM 787-9 is lacking a separate IFE control unit (for people who like gaming) and the screen is not adjustable, there could be more lavatories and it would be better if it had manual shades.

Even the so-called Economy Comfort seats (not to be confused with Premium Economy on other airlines) are only a fraction better as the added comfort might be in length and recline but not in width. Immensely appreciated the mixture of young and older stewardesses and top marks for the way they interacted with all passengers during the flight. On my two trips the pursers were situated in my section, whose professionalism I greatly enjoyed.  And one of the stewardesses was working on her last flight before getting married. This was with great fanfare announced by the captain followed by a guest appearance of one the off-duty pilots to congratulate her in person and making himself available to answer questions from passengers. Usage of the inflight entertainment system was easy and had a good selection of new, recent and foreign movies that I was able to catch up on. A few notes on the preparation of the trip, it was disappointing not being able to bid for an upgrade to business class as stated on the KLM website for the legs.

I have experience this before with other airlines and understand that losing your luggage is a risk you take when flying. However, that was 3 days ago and I have called the airline 6 times to be told 6 different stories and different times to expect my luggage. They confirmed that my luggage was found and arrived in the UK (1 hour from when I am staying) on Thursday evening and said it had been picked up by the courier they hire on Friday morning. Currently the earliest expected delivery time they can give me is Monday evening. This is 5 and a half days after arriving in the country (and that is providing this information is not false like the previous 5 expected arrival times). I have asked to speak to the department manager but have been told that one is not available every time I have called. We travelled to England for a special occasion and ultimately do not have clothes to wear to that occasion.

Most times I end up on Lufthansa, British Airways or SAS, who all have wider seats, bigger screens and power supply in their premium economy class (I avoid the US airlines for all it's worth). The additional leg space and seat width makes the difference for me. For the first time I chose to try KLM premium economy for my Houston to Amsterdam trip. What a disappointment! The seats were the same as in economy class, i.e. exactly the same width. The only difference was a few inches extra of leg space. If you choose an emergency seat, which costs less than the premium economy on KLM, you basically get a better product. The screens looked like they came from a different era, pixelated and tiring to look at. Also, there was no power supply at all.

This little competition makes the tickets rather pricy in comparison to flights to Asia. Their website is awful in many respects (I would have to fill pages, so I don't write why), that made our expectations not very happy either. We were very surprised that none of our prejudices turned out to be confirmed. Not a single delay, on the contrary - we reached all destinations up to 10 minutes earlier than scheduled. Friendly staff on ground and in the air. On both long hauls, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful - we are accustomed to Asian Airlines and have become quite fastidious about service, but this reached the same level. Our prebookings of gluten free and Hindu meals had been lost by their sappy website, but the staff did their utmost to compose some convenient replacement food for us and re-ordered instantly our meals for the return flight (with success). The quality of the food itself was average but edible. The movie entertainment consisted mainly of stale news, mainstream thrillery, or animations which I preferred because the screens are not good enough for any dark scene in a normal movie - you see nothing but a black screen. Because of the cheap earbuds, acoustics qualities are very low and it was hard to understand much of the dialogues in English (English subtitles would help a lot!) - and there were few films in German.

"""consider them for the next trip""",8,2017-03-25,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Kuala Lumpur via Amsterdam.

There is WiFi. Catering OK, but my usual carrier is Etihad, so the experience was a little different, no a la carte table service. Flight boarded at T4 from the gate opposite the Lounge, very convenient. At Schipol we had just about 50 minutes from touchdown to the onward connection, which was enough time to have a quick drink, find our way to the gate and immediately board the next flight. With such a short connection I was worried our luggage wouldn't make the flight, but when we arrived at KUL there it was! The new World Business Class is very open and comfortable. The seating is great, save for the fact that you have no direct aisle access for the window seat. If you are travelling as a couple this is fine, for solo travellers it might prove tiresome. The on-board service was great, the staff were attentive and extremely helpful. The catering was OK, very Dutch shall we say! The drinks were good quality, but a bit mean. Nothing that one could really grumble about. The in-flight entertainment is good quality and there was an adequate range of new and classic programming to keep me entertained until bed time! The bed is great and I slept like a baby. Even though they are older aircraft I like the sense of space you get with the Boeing 777, which somehow you don't quite feel on other aircraft even the 380. The price was comparable to Etihad (about GBP 300 more) but the flight is 1hr to AMS, a 1hr layover and then a 12hr leg to KUL. Reverse journey the same timings. For EY you have a 3 or 4 hour layover and now they have adjusted their timetable you have to either leave UK early in the morning or arrive very late to KUL. The KLM timings are much friendlier.

KLM personnel told us to wait outside of the airport for a free shuttle to get to the hotel, but the shuttle never arrived (we were waiting for more than one hour). We were calling and calling the hotel, but it never responded. After we took a taxi and reached, finally, the hotel, it turned out there were no vacant rooms for us there. The hotel's personnel sent us to another location (another taxi on our expense), and we were lucky to find vacant rooms there - it was about 3 am. Overall, it took us about five hours to have finally a rest after we landed. The next day, I found out that the route of my flight was changed - now, I had to take a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt and an Aeroflot flight to Moscow, Lufthansa assigned me a seat to fly to Frankfurt, but they could not issue a boarding pass from FRA to SVO saying that they are not partners with Aeroflot. So, until I arrived to Frankfurt, I did not know whether Aeroflot would take me or not, Thanks God, it did.

Given how empty this later actually flight was, I think it was more the case of me being bumped because I had no status with the airline and KLM simply moved all their Gold and Silver members to my flight. I was supposed to be connecting to a Xiamen Airlines flight (AMS-XMN then XMN-HKG) in AMS but after pointing out that I might make the connection but my baggage definitely wouldn't, the check-in staff agreed and rerouted me. The only way I could get to Hong Kong was to be rebooked onto KLM's direct flight leaving AMS at 5.45pm so had nearly 6 hours layover in Schipol airport. However I was offered 120 euros as compensation so wasn't too depressed and it meant not having to go through the nonsense of immigration at Xiamen despite being a transit passenger. The first leg of the journey (MAN-AMS) left after 9.30am and was not helped by whoever's decision it was to refuel it the plane only once all the passengers were on-board the aircraft. I ask you, this aircraft had been sat empty for at least previous 3 hours! The flight itself was comfortable with decent seat width/pitch plus crew came around with a snack and a drink. Once at AMS, I found the KLM desk and managed to bag an exit row for the 11 hour flight and was delighted until I discovered that the plane (B747-400) had no in-seat USB power in economy unlike the new Xiamen Airlines B787 Dreamliner (which is partly why I booked with Xiamen Airlines in the first place).

However once into the flight, I could really understand why many airlines are now ditching the 747 in favour of more modern planes like the the 787 or the A380.  However this KLM flight did have one redeeming feature that was the staff who worked hard the entire flight. The toilets which I was sat close to were cleaned around 4-5 times and crew offered drinks throughout the flight. The food offerings were beef or pasta but by the time they reached me, the pasta had run out and I thought I might be missing out but was brought along a vegetarian Indian style meal which was rather good. As we were descending into Hong Kong, I discovered my seat was broken and could not return to the upright position. One of the crew came around and fixed it but a few minutes later, I could feel it had gone again when I leant back. Given we were so close to landing, I just leant forward instead and kept quiet.

We were also offered small screen devices and headphones for watching films, but I didn't take one.

As the other reviewer mentioned, the seats were the standard narrow ones and they'd simply left the middle seat empty. That didn't bother me too much because it was only a medium haul flight, but the level of service and the quality of food was far inferior to Aeroflot. There was a choice of two main hot dishes, but no printed menu, and they had even run out of choice for the gentleman sitting behind me.

The flight back was OK but lacked the personal and efficient element of outbound which is why I didn't give full marks. Staff friendly but I gained the impression staff just wanted passengers fed and watered as quickly as possible and many things were forgotten, from cognac to museli, everything was a rush. To confirm what others have said, boarding chaotic at Schipol which was nothing to do with security, just the insistence of moving children with associated buggies, people with special requirements and business class all at the same time. BA stagger boarding in that order which is more sensible as one might have priority boarding but you have to climb over everyone else in the waiting area which is so small.

The seats were typical economy so nothing flash. The cabin crew were really friendly and proactive throughout both flights. Water and or juice was offered quite frequently a courtesy bar area was available with drinks and snacks ie help yourself not that you needed it because staff were very attentive to requests. Food was ok with staff working well as a team when some options were short on supply. All flights were right on time. I flew on with them to and out and of Norwich.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,4,2015-05-31,In Amsterdam May 12th trying to get my boarding pass for my connecting flight to Kilimanjaro Airport. No reservation. Next kiosk no reservation. Tried both the Delta and the KLM flight #'s. Found KLM rep who sent me down to transfers who then tried it for me typing in both KLM and Delta flight #'s. No reservation so sent me on to Transfer rep who eventually found me and sent me back to a kiosk for seat assignment. Return trip from Kilimanjaro to Amsterdam I previously paid for Economy Plus seat upgrade with confirmation printed in hand and also on my Iphone. My seat 10J was also sold to someone else who checked in just before me. No other windows for the 12.5 hour flight so he finally gave me a window seat farther back. What a way to do business!

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,,2015-05-28,"I was travelling last week with my 90 year old and very infirm husband we were told at the airport that we were being put on standby and might not get on the flight which we had booked many weeks in advance (and in respect of which KLM had several times emailed us confirming our seat numbers)? We were told that it was KLM policy to overbook flights and that this was ""in the small print"". I am revolted by this policy. We had bought and paid for our tickets and received several email confirmations from KLM about this. I was travelling with somebody who was simply not physically fit to be transported to another city to catch an alternative flight (the suggestion which was made to us at the airport). If an airline sell tickets which people pay for in good faith and intend to oversell the flight so that these tickets will be meaningless this needs to made explicit and clearly spelt out to customers - not hidden in ""the small print"".",False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,,False

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,6,2015-05-20,I flew KL 791 AMS-GRU a flight of almost 12 hrs so Business Class was a huge plus and the free seat next to me gave me even more space - great! The downside was that I felt like being served without a personal touch why? 1) No second pre departure drink. 2) I was asked what I like to eat without receiving the menu first and the FA forgot to ask which appetizer I want (normally that is fixed). 3) During the flight it was hard to get snacks and drinks (I had to walk to the economy class FA's and ask them). 4) In preparation for landing I had to bring my hand luggage back in the overhead bins on my own (FA asked me to get up and do it while she was standing next to me without helping me). The good stuff was the taste of the food and the good wines/drinks as well as a comfortable lie flat seat with an angle (only a few of the 25 KLM 777 are lie flat without an angle today). Speaking about the FA's on board they where always smiling and the economy FA's have been very helpful fast and with a personal touch.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,8,2015-05-16,BHX-DOH and return. KLM was convenient for me as I live in Birmingham and could therefore travel to Doha via Amsterdam without the need to travel down to London. The ticket price was also the cheapest available for this trip. The short hop from Birmingham to Amsterdam only takes about an hour but the 06.00 departure always serves a cold breakfast sandwich with tea coffee or juices. The layover in Amsterdam was 1 hour 55 minutes giving more than enough time to make my connection. The flight to Doha was not full whereas most Qatar Airways flights are as most of the passengers will be transiting. Once airborne the passenger next to me was offered the choice of moving seats so that we could all spread out a little making the journey much more comfortable. The IFE is adequate but the screen a little small though there is a good range of entertainment. On the outbound flight there were only two options for economy main course but the food was reasonable as airline food goes. All flights departed and arrived on time the crew were very good and I was pleasantly surprised that despite being the cheapest choice for my route KLM provided a service that I was more than happy with. I will look to see if I can get to my destinations via Amsterdam with KLM in the future and recommend for value for money.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,,True
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,10,2015-05-12,Our first flight on KLM. YYC to AMS. Since it was an 8 hour plus flight we flew business class. The aircraft was a newer Boeing 777-200 which for reasons that evade me did not have sequential seating (ABC etc). We booked our seats on-line and thought we were sitting together which upon boarding we discovered we were not. This happened to 5 other couples as well. The flight attendants were reasonable and everybody affected were willing to swap seats even though business class was a full bus to Amsterdam. The meals were tasty and there lots of snacks. My one beef is that KLM should monitor their cleaning contractors more closely. I lost some change and some items from amenity kit under the pod. In the course of reaching underneath I found all sorts of goodies which could have been vacuumed up. I enjoyed the flight and the lie flat bed even though flying east and trying to sleep is a Herculean effort. I recommend KLM and will gladly fly with them again. One last caveat: I am old school and believe that one should fly the national airline within reason to the country you are visiting.

The seats were comfortable and reclined to a full flat bed parallel with the floor not on an angle!). It was so clean and smartly laid out. The entertainment system looked brand new was high quality and featured something for everyone without being annoyingly edited. Service was very attentive and friendly. The soup entree was something of a revelation and I was surprisingly keen to get the recipe. The main was fairly good and after settling down with a bit of cheese and dessert wine from the trolley I slept for about 7.5 hours straight.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,7,2015-04-22,KL808 MNL-AMS 8 April 2015. Bought an upgrade with FB miles which is pretty affordable when you have the N Booking class of Eco fare (Middle of the week the Business Class often has spare seats). Since KLM moved to T3 the service at the airport has greatly improved! FA's as usual are very friendly attentive and considerate and the flight is always on time with a consistent service. The only downside of this flight is the stop in Taipei which by law oblige passengers to disembark and board again. Flight without issues despite the older Business Class seats (which should be replaced urgently). KLM has the convenient flight schedules to/from Asia with no change of plane in the middle of the night so you arrive fresh and ready to work in AMS. Had 2 music instruments at check-in in Manila and the ground crew proposed to load them by hand to avoid breaking and they were delivered at the special luggage in AMS (Ok the Platinum level helps but still).

However their aircraft are certainly ageing and there is no aspect of the airline that could really be qualified as ""excellent."" Further they actually prevented me from accruing airline miles with a partner carrier something generally unheard of.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,2,2015-04-01,Rio to AMS in EcoComfort. KLM asks for absurd prices for the upgrade in this case approximately one third of the full return fare of just one leg upgrade. Got seat 14A last seat in the Economy Comfort section which on KLM is not cordoned off from ordinary Eco section. I usually opt for a window seat so as to be able to lean against the wall to catch some sleep. This seat and I trust 14K as well suffers from a major design flaw. It misses a window and when it reclines the pax head levels off with the window of the rear Eco seat making it impossible to lean against the wall. Trying to fill the void with a pillow won't help either because the pillows provided are just too tiny for that. Moreover probably due to being in the last row in the EcoComfort section the seat does not recline as much as other seats in the section. Understandably so obviously because if it did it would leave too little space for the Economy seat behind. My clear verdict is that this seat is not worth a dime let alone the absurd price asked and paid for it. The fellow passenger behind me in row 15 made a better judgement. He saved the upgrade money and had 3 seats for himself alone to lay down and doze off while I was trying to find the least painful position to close an eye on an 11 hour flight. As if the dismal seating were not enough the service was truly KLM unworthy. Flight left around 9.15pm and it took 1hr 30 mins to start dinner service. Food itself was very much inedible. The flight attendant assigned to my section was very unfriendly in fact bordering on obnoxious. All in all one of the worst experiences I have had with KLM.

Return leg was very similar: fast bag drop (with the hi-tech DIY machines) easy boarding (although remote stand this time) friendly crew on time departure and the economy comfort seats were actually business class seats on the Embraer 190.

The one hour flight to Amsterdam was with KLM Cityhopper on an Embraer 190. The crew were attentive and jolly and the meal a salad was excellent. The connection at Amsterdam was easy and despite being just over one hour was not a rushed one. On board the Boeing 747-400 I was seated in 1A (a seat by itself). The Purser and crew in this cabin were excellent and I truly was pampered.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,,2015-03-17,Booked flights with KLM for our honeymoon 5 months in advance including reserving seats.

We had not been contacted to tell us of this and so were stuck without any option and no time to alter the flight. Spent hours on phone to their customer service team but completely unable to help. Eventually had to pay additional fare on one of our flights to sit next to my wife on our honeymoon despite us previously booking seats next to each other. No apologies no suggestion that they would refund the additional fee paid. The outward bound flight from Amsterdam to LA was on a 747 that is in serious need of updating. uncomfortable rock solid and narrow seats with very little leg room. They ran out of one of the dinner options before they got to our seat no apologies or explanations just put in on our table and said 'here is your dinner' didn't even say what it was. As it turns out it was bland and terrible. Stewardess became quite stroppy when complained at lack of choice of meals and made it seam like she was performing heroic acts to try and get an alternative meal.

Besides this plane being ancient and the fact that I felt sorry for all the people by the windows with no direct aisle access I had a terrifically smooth flight. I had heard about and seen photos of odd dishes served but not on this flight. All food throughout the flight was delicious plentiful and served on interestingly designed dishware. Previously I experienced some plastic items but not this time. The AVOD was OK but did not have as recent offerings as their partner Delta and the quality of the large screen was milky. The seat was surprisingly soft and was comfortable in any position including lie flat. The toilets were cleaned throughout and FA were always available in the galley with smiles. The FA were remarkably genial and good at their jobs. There were two toilets dedicated to all of business class and I never once saw an economy passenger try to enter. Overall I loved my flights.

Eventually managed to get two seats together. Boarding at Amsterdam was a bit chaotic. Aircraft was B777-300: unsure of the age of the plane but business class cabin in my opinion looked drab and dingy when compared to say Qatar. Seats were OK and everything worked.

Paid for Economy Comfort for this leg and got the first row bulkhead seats which has tremendous legroom. In flight service is good and friendly but the hard products really needs to be improved. Second leg AMS-LHR in a very old and small Fokker 70. KLM should already retire this type of aircraft but they did maintain the plane well it was clean and in good condition. Only the noise of the jet engine really bothering us as we sit all the way in the back (Fokker planes has the engines near the tail of the aircraft) luckily the flight to London is only 45 minutes.

Third leg London Heathrow to Amsterdam in a Skyteam livery Boeing 737-900 good legroom and service is similar as the AMS-LHR where we get a cake and a drink. Last leg AMS-CGK with a stopover in KUL also in an old non refurbished Boeing 777-200. Good thing the crew really performed well and deliver prompt and good service most of the time.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,2,2015-02-18,Flew from SIN to AMS return. Very poor economy class seat especially for intercontinental flights above 10 hours. Seats are extremely squashed (not sure why KLM adopted a 3x4x3 seat layout when other long haul airlines rarely do). Recline is absolutely horrendous for an overnight flight - the seat was definitely not suitable for a night's sleep maybe only a short 30 minutes nap. Furthermore KLM's economy class tickets are not cheap - merely cheaper than top notch Singapore Airlines by 120 euros. Therefore I do not get why KLM is so cheapskate to pack so many people in economy class on very poor quality seats. The seats are so cramped that passengers have so much difficulty getting in and out of their seats to use the lavatory!

The short flight to Amsterdam was very good with a high quality snack and very friendly crew. Arrival at Schipol was 20 minutes early. Unfortunately Schipol Airport is undergoing refurbishment which makes it something of a mess but the lounge was welcoming and not too crowded. Boarding from Gate E7 was very disappointing. It was a mess. Everyone had to go thru a security check and the queues were long. Then once thru security it was standing room only. Boarding was just a rugby scrum as people tried to get out of the claustrophobic boarding area. On board the Dubai flight the crew were very welcoming. Departure was on time and the on board product was very good. I am used to the KLM Business Class seat and while it may not be a flat bed it is fine for the approx. 6 hour flight to Dubai. Food was as usual of a high standard as was the overall cabin service. I have been loyal to KLM for many years and that loyalty will continue.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,,True
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,7,2015-01-28,KL808 7 Jan 2015. KL807 25 Dec 2014. I have been flying KLM rather regularly now since I need to maintain my Flying Blue membership. Sadly I still miss my Miles and More days especially flying Lufthansa. Like Lufthansa KLM is indeed reliable. But it is bland - or blander if one doesn't think highly of Lufthansa. My last flight with KLM - long haul to MNL and back to AMS was ok but the business class seats were the old ones. Service was rather poor as the flight attendants designated to and fro TPE (both) failed to deliver on my request for a drink and when followed up would say that they can no longer serve any drink. The lounge in MNL is awful. And the stop in TPE wastes passengers' time.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,2,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,,True
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,7,2015-01-26,What can I say about long haul KLM? A true tale of extremes: Pros: Value for money (only £560 return ABZ-SIN via AMS). Lounge at AMS (free food drinks wifi and showers via Petroleum Card). Food and Beverage onboard was to a surprisingly good standard for economy airline food and freely available. Staff were attentive and helpful. Cons: Seat didn't recline anywhere near as much as it does in any other airline Ive flown with and felt really cramped - I found this odd given the Dutch are the tallest in the world! IFE was so dated and a limited poor selection of music films and TV. Cabin decor is dull. All in all not too bad but the cons niggled away at me.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,5,,,True
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,9,2015-01-26,I travelled YYC-JNB return. They made the 22 hour journey enjoyable! KLM staff are professional and friendly my seat was comfortable the plane was clean and the food was good. My only complaint is the lounge at AMS. What a waste of time and load of unnecessary aggravation. Crowded staff ignored me and I never did get my much needed shower.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,4,2015-01-21,Stockholm - Amsterdam - Nairobi return. The outbound journey was very pleasant with everything going very smoothly and the comfort in terms of seating food and entertainment was just fine. However when going back home we were notified that our flight was cancelled for unclear reasons that KLM did not want to tell us (we still haven't gott any explanation more than two months later). We got a less comfortable alternative journey home which worked out alright. I guess cancellations can happen but the way KLM handled this one makes me a bit hesitant to choose them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,,True
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,10,2015-01-19,Return flights from BRU to YVR via AMS after New Year. BRU to AMS flight delayed due to late arrival of incoming aircraft by 15 minutes we boarded the plane Captain was there to greet all pax upon boarding. Then captain took PA to inform us of further delay by 30 minutes as Schipol Airport have strong winds and to delay take-off in BRU until weather in destination cleared. Most pax including me had tight connections but again managed to catch onward flight. KLM is a very efficient airlines when it comes to baggage handling with tight connections. Food and drinks offered are ample and nothing to complain about. What amazed me is during second meal service 2 hours before touchdown in YVR I asked the purser for coffee but responded that it will be offered after the meal service are all done and after an hour she still recall that I asked for a coffee given the flight is totally full and very busy.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,,True

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,7,2015-01-19,BKK-AMS B747 in the updated business class. Despite booking a specific seat and confirming it 3X I did not receive the seat. This was unacceptable and the airlines response was sorry too bad. Not the most intelligent way of treating a business class client. Check-in was disorganized and time consuming which was very odd for BKK because I have never experienced this at BKK. Part of the problem is that there is a scrum approach to check in. Boarding was equally disorganized and unusually unpleasant for business class on a BKK long haul. The plane departed late and arrived late but the Captain's honest explanation made it a non issue. The professionalism carried through to the on board service crew who were some of the most cheerful and efficient FAs I have experienced. Meals were disappointing as they were uninspiring and overly salty. Beverage selection was decent. The new seat left me with a sore back after 12 hours. KLM missed an opportunity to catch up with airlines such as Cathay EVA and ANA as the new seats are nothing special and still leaves KLM as a class below the aforementioned airlines. The amenity kit while nice looking was basic and again not as useful as Asian carriers no slippers were provided which is unusual on an Asian flight. Nor was I able to get a newspaper. First time on a long haul flight where newspapers were not available to me in the cabin. IFE was varied and ok although the map program is as bad as Air France's and not very informative. Overall it was a generic flight that got me where I had to go safely. The Dutch flight crew were excellent while the Air France/KLM ground crew in BKK were mediocre. I would not recommend KLM as a carrier on this route unless a direct flight to AMS was required as there are much better options available with the Asian carriers.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,,False

All flight were on time or a little below schedule and on all flights the staff were friendly and informal - a nice experience as usual. Food was OK nothing very fashionable and drink service as expected (although on return flight no vodka for Bloody Mary was available). IFE good especially - as expected - in audio rock music section which in KLM is among the best in the air. The only complaints are about the seating in B777-300ER. Formerly I have flew the 777-200 with 3x3x3 option and found that very comfortable. The 3x4x3 is not ideal. You could for a small fee get slightly more space for legs but not broader seats and the new arrangements are both narrow and hard. Paradoxically seats in the short-haul B737 are much better.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,2,2015-01-11,My wife and I flew from Singapore to Bali on 23rd December 2014 - never again. First problem was with an officious male steward who although I knew where my seat was insisted on looking at our tickets telling me that was why he was stood there and then proceeded to direct us to the starboard side of the plane rather than the port side where our seats A + B were which resulted in us having to walk on down the plane on the wrong side and then cut through and then try to walk back up the plane against the flow of passengers to get to our seats. Second problem was on our return flight to Singapore on the evening of the 27th all the passengers were hanging around for hours at Bali airport as there was a problem with the plane. Not a problem until we heard that the flight was cancelled and that we would be moved to hotels. No one who could speak English or Dutch was available to liaise with the passengers to advise us of the arrangements. The crowd sort of drifted towards the exit but no one came to tell us about reclaiming our baggage or times of the buses etc. We then drifted towards to baggage reclaim hall down some service steps and then had to find where the cases were coming in. We then drifted towards the exit and then the fun started. The buses turned up again with no explanation and we were trampled on by the Dutch in their efforts to get on the buses. We eventually got on to a bus. but had to stand with our luggage dumped along the aisles. We then were again trampled on by them in their effort to get into the hotel so we stood back to let them fight it out. We then eventually got our room but no mention of how we were getting back to the airport the following day. We did get a phone call from KLM telling us we needed to be at the airport first thing in the morning to get a flight with Silk Air. We got a taxi back and thankfully the flight went OK no thanks to the very poor communication skills shown by KLM. Problems arise and safety is of course paramount but if there was some one there who could lead the tired passengers through the situation and keep them informed the matter would have been far less traumatic instead it was the blind leading the blind.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,3,,,False
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,10,2015-01-11,AMS-BUD return. Decent price of 110 euros.

Was very nice to see how the company is trying to become more 'green' sandwich on the inbound leg was with free range chicken and on the outbound with special cheese and cream cheese from the north of the Netherlands. When collecting the rubbish everything was neatly sorted in to paper-plastic- metal bins. Seat just like any other European airline you can live with it.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,10,2015-01-11,Flew LHR to AMS then AMS to KIX Osaka. Check in at LHR was fast and efficient good fast track through customs. The lounge at T4 was clean spacious and bright. Had a very nice English breakfast. Flight to AMS was perfect considering the very high winds with no delays left and arrived on time. Skyteam lounge at Schiphol was large with plenty of comfy seating with bubbles wine and spirits and snacks. One of the nicest lounges I have visited. Again the flight on 777-200 was on time even a little early pushing back. Although the seats were the older style seats found to be quite comfortable. the recline was not as much as I hoped but still got 5 hours sleep. The staff on board were nothing but accommodating friendly and very efficient chose the Japanese menu to get me off to a good start even had great sakai on board. The return from KIX to AMS was good with a fast check in and efficient pass through customs (although no fast track was offered). The lounge is small but very comfortable with some odd seats looking out over the runway. Flight home was on a 777-300 which had better seating than on flight out. Again the staff were excellent funny and friendly. Could not ask for more. The food was well prepared tasty and very hot. The cabin was almost empty which meant could spread out. Got at least 6 hours of perfect sleep. The flight home from AMS to LHR was on KLM city hopper. Very small plane and it was packed. The seats are no different than those in economy and would in future not bother with Business on this service. To be fair flight only 45 minutes so small seat not a problem. All in all an excellent service from KLM - I would definitely fly with them again.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,,True

A sensible connection was available but we were told that it was impossible to make. When we took the flight we made it to earlier connection with plenty of time to spare but were told it was now impossible to transfer. Even with an eight-hour layover it was impossible to transfer to another other flights because of our baggage. The transfer desk was extraordinarily curt “Impossible” and “No” were all we got.

That flight KL1904 HAJ-AMS got cancelled (no early info no reason given) and the way the KLM staff (incl. agent in Hannover) handled information assistance rebooking was terrible. Unfriendly not knowledgeable uninterested - passengers were treated with a ""don't know can't do take it or leave it"" attitude. This is being continued at Amsterdam airport where no interest or customer focus is shown (ie. by lounge staff) when after all I am a day late (having missed all appointments in Holland).

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,8,2014-12-29,AMS-PTY and return. I flew with KLM for the first time. The reason was the price and the flight schedule. Departure was late because of the fog. The captain informed us well and during the flight they gave information about the connection flights in PTY. Onboard the seat felt very narrow. It was onboard of a 777-300ER. Not much choice on the IFE but for me it was enough. The crew was very attentive and friendly. The food was good especially the icecream the served half way the flight. On the return I flew with a 777-200. It was on old plane but the seats were more spacious. The screen for the IFE was bad smaal and you couldn't see much on te screen in some positions. The crew was friendly again and there was good food. What I also liked is that the crew offering you plenty of drinks and after dinner they offer you liquor. Nice touch I didn't saw it on other airlines I flew with. We departed and arrived on time. So overall a good experience. I would definitely choose KLM again if the price is right. It's not very special but it's good and they have a nice crew. The only thing is that they have to renew their fleet.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,2,2014-12-18,Taipei to Amsterdam. I am quite familiar with that flight and I already know the defects (old air plane etc.) but I chose it nonetheless because of the convenient schedule. On my last trip the impression is that the company was saving money on every aspect. The food was shameful. The main dinner dish was pieces of chicken in a brown sauce with some peanuts in it. The breakfast made even less sense - the main food was one square omelette with one bacon slice served with two pieces of cheese and one stale croissant. The inflight entertainment / control did not work and this meant no reading light throughout the whole trip no possibility to call the cabin attendants (even to get a glass of water I had to jump over my neighbour). All this on top of the old airplane lack of privacy and an extremely uncomfortable sleeping position (as the seat is not horizontal every time you turn then you have to climb up the seat again). The ticket cost 5000EUR return I would not recommend it - a shame KLM fell so low.,False,,,Business Class,,,1,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,,False

The service was offered twice the first with sandwich with cheese and selection of drinks (hot beverages and soft drinks) and followed with tea and coffee with biscuits.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,7,2014-11-17,Rio de Janeiro - London via Amsterdam B777-200. Overnight flight from Rio to London - lucky for me I got an empty seat next to me. The seat actually felt quite roomy for economy class seat pitch seemed generous. The exit row upgrade was absurdly priced at £120 (on a £490 flight) at time of booking - for comparison the first leg with Air France was £50 which I paid. KLM also offers 'economy comfort' which seems to be premium economy but at €180 to upgrade I ignored - you can check out on the seat map if you actually get more room but I looked closely on the way out of the plane and there is no discernible difference in pitch and still a 3x3x3 configuration. IFE was exceptionally poor on this flight - I'm not sure if 2014 has been a bad year for blockbusters but very little worth watching and each TV show only has one episode which is very annoying. Why would you only want to watch one episode is beyond me. Food was pretty decent though and the service attentive so overall a positive flight.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,9,2014-11-12,Flew from Toronto - Amsterdam and return. The first flight was one of the last for the MD11. The return was 747. The seats on the 747 were excellent. The upper deck was like a private room. Staff were first rate. The captain came and introduced himself as did the chief purser. Staff were attentive and often anticipated requests. The meal out of Toronto was fair at best but it always is. Out of Amsterdam it was very good. The sole was one of the best meals I have had on an aircraft in years. My only negative is the departure gate in Schiphol. Security is cleared at the gate. This meant the flight was called an hour and a half before departure. All the passengers were squeezed sardine lik in the tiny waiting area. There was not enough seating. Wheelchairs had to push through with the result that people were stepping on each other. I mentioned this to the KLM attendant at the gate. She told me to write the management.

My partner got the Dutch style meal and it was always delicious and I kept getting the Asian meal which was just ok. The website said that economy would get an amenity bag but these were missing from our flights so we didn't have an eye mask and toothbrush as we thought they would be provided but they were not. The seats were awful. My partner and I are not big or tall and we are usually quite comfortable in standard economy seats but these were horrible. My knees were touching the seat in front of me and there was a box under the seat in front of me so I couldn't put my feet anywhere. At mealtimes it was difficult to eat because we had to keep our elbows in to keep from elbowing our neighboring passengers. By the end of our going flight we had decided pay for the exit row seats for the return flight (AMS-NRT return). I don't get it because this is not a budget airline but the seats were so tight. There were cheaper airlines flying to Tokyo but we chose this one thinking it would be more comfortable.

The food is way below the standard of some other 4 and 5 star airlines. Same goes for the inflight entertainment. Not many new movies lot's of old stuff. And the screens and remote controls are old small and cumbersome.

As they provide power sockets to their long-haul Business Class seats I assumed that this would be no problem but believe it or not KLM will not allow passengers to connect medical equipment to their power sockets!

Configuration was old style 2-2-2. IFE was AVOD but screens were again low quality and system has seen better time; e.g. only the third pair of headphones I received actually worked. Meals served were Cajun Tuna and Chicken Tikka Masala (or Steak or Cannelloni) for dinner and Blueberry Pancakes (or Feta Omelette) for breakfast. Food served was ok catering on the flight out of KLMs home base Amsterdam on the way to the US was far superior to the offerings on this flight back. Wine list again nice with some interesting choices out of the box. AMS-VIE was fine and on-time with nothing special to report seats were economy seats with the middle seat left vacant KLM uses a rented lounge facility in DFW which was OK with a good selection of drinks and limited food offerings definitely better than the typical lounges run by the US airlines. KLMs Schengen lounge in AMS was again comfortable again with a decent drink selection and limited food offerings. Transfer in AMS meant walking long distances but was eventless otherwise. Transfer immigration and security control involved considerable less waiting time than I remember from previous instances. I have flown with AA BA AY IB and LX on transatlantic routes over the past years and all featured more modern planes with better business class seating. KLM needs to retire or update these old planes to offer a really competitive transatlantic product. So except for the seating a good flight but due to the old seats far from perfect product for a night flight. Recommended if available at a very competitive price.,False,,,Business Class,,,2,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,3,,,True

My bag was refused 4 times. I really hate the self-service bag drop off units and will try to avoid them next time. Luckily there is always a standard manned bag drop unit available. One of the main reasons that I prefer flying KLM is the 'welcome feeling' you get when you enter the plane. On both flights the crew was very friendly and attentive.

IFE was AVOD but screens were from previous century and picture quality poor selection was OK. WBC seats were just angle-flat and rather tired but comfortable for resting on a day flight. FAs were brilliant attentive and doing their job with a smile. Food served was quite good. Salmon Tartare and Indonesian Chicken Curry (or 2 other choices of Beef or Plaice) for lunch. Chili Prawns and Indonesian Beef (or Cod) for the second meal. It was nice that the product featured some Dutch (Indonesian) elements throughout the flight and was not just generic. Wines served were also nice with some interesting choices not just the standard fare. KL uses a shared airport lounge in VIE which is not particularly great but in line with other lounges in VIE and at least not overcrowded. KL’s Non-Schengen lounge in AMS was nice and spacious with a decent selection of drinks but with limited food choices. Transfer in AMS involved walking long distances but was otherwise hassle free.

However they seem to really dislike Delta Sky Miles members. I have been a SkyTeam Diamond Member due to travel for more than four years straight. It never fails. KLM will guarantee great seats for its direct ticket passengers but it will ALWAYS shove the Delta passengers into middle rows/seats no matter what. You might get lucky on occasion.

Picked up the boarding pass at the airport via self service machine without any trouble. Boarding was efficient and quick. Plane (B777-300ER) left on time. I am not that big but leg (and knee) space was more than enough (considering it was economy). Enjoyed the IFE although I do believe the movie selection could have been better (however it changes monthly). Food was good and I must state that the fact that KLM constantly replaces the snacks on the back of the plane is very good: If you are ever thirsty or hungry you can always find a constantly renewed set of snacks and drinks at the back.

No such luck the cabin crew told me the roll-out on the 777's won't now start till October. The old business class seats in a 2-3-2 configuration simply isn't what you expect on a premium airline. Also due to staff shortages there wasn't a fast-track channel opened up on boarding.

Food about average for an international airline. Planes were A330's seats much like Qatar Airways I rarely lay flat but it looked like others were able to.

Wake up in Europe and be on the Pacific coast before noon! I tracked the punctuality of the flight in the two days before my own and it was five hours late and four hours late respectively so I should have been relieved that we were taxiing only one hour late although my dream of a morning arrival in California was dashed. The reason given was late arrival of the inbound aircraft but with all the flight tracking apps these days airlines are going to have to be more creative with their excuses - our aircraft had arrived from Paramaribo hours earlier and on schedule. New business class seat on KLM is pretty good note that only window seats have a little shelf next to the headrest so I had room for books iPod et al but not sure what aisle pax are supposed to do with their stuff. Food was excellent was sorry they didn't have a spare as I would have eaten it up despite being quite full. Only downside was the crew were not very friendly overall and one in particular was extremely unhappy to be there a lot of hostility on show which is inappropriate given what biz class pax have paid.

I had a terribly uncomfortable seat (15A) in what KLM ironically calls economy comfort class and for which it even charges a premium economy price. The slightly friendly cabin crew were among the least competent cabin staff I have ever seen on a flight. There were people still standing when the flight took off and no crew to be found. The crew tells passengers to close the overhead bins and finally the crew left the cabin lights on for several hours into into the flight and probably would have left them on the whole flight if I had not asked them to turn them off.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,,2014-07-15,KLM 1845 from Amsterdam to Vienna on of July. We had booked the flight over a month before the flight departure date. Upon online check-in one of us was at the front of the plane and the other at the very rear. We had to ring up customer support as the online check in gave no other seating options and asked to change this so that we could sit together. We were told the only seats next to each other had the aisle in between. We were also told if we got to the airport early the check-in staff should change this so we could sit in the same row together. We arrived at airport check-in more than 3 hours early but we were told the airplane was full and there was no way to get around this. We were also told that we had to pay 30 Euro to check in our baggage since we had not done it online (but we couldn't do it online or else we wouldn't have been able to change our seats at the airport!). We discussed our experience with the lady at the check-in desk and she told us if we used one of the computers located on the other side of the airport we would be able to check our luggage in for free. So we went and found an internet kiosk checked in and still had to pay 15 Euro per suitcase. We then went back to the check in desk paid an extra 20 Euro each to sit in an 'Economy Comfort' seat because we were told there was simply nothing else that could be done. Long story short: this two hour flight cost us $900 AUD up front to be seated nowhere near each other. When we tried to alter this so we could sit next to each other it cost us an extra $120 AUD. Would never ever fly again nor recommend to anybody else.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,1,,,False
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,9,2014-07-13,I would definitely recommend KLM. Recently flew KRS-AMS-CDG. All flights were really comfortable due to KLM's big legroom (so that tall Dutch people can have a decent flight). Staff were polite and efficient. Flights were always on time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,,True
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,8,2014-07-12,Flew from KUL-AMS and return AMS-KUL. Flight to Amsterdam was on a 777-200 and flight to Kuala Lumpur was on a 777-300. The flights were excellent with a cheery and efficient cabin crew. In-flight entertainment on the 777-200 was mediocre - although sleeping had a higher priority than checking all the movies and series. Flight to Kuala Lumpur unfortunately was overbooked but luckily KLM managed to get us a seat. All in all flights were very comfortable perfectly on-time and yes I would choose them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,,True
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,9,2014-07-12,LAX-AMS. Flight 602. Boarding was quick. Onboard they offered free newspapers pillows blankets earphones good entertainment system alcohol and 2 meals - dinner and breakfast. The crew offered good service but definitely nothing special. Legroom was typical for the airline and the aircraft type but I wouldn't mind just a bit more space. The highlight of the trip was punctuality. We were on time when flew to LA. We arrived earlier when we flew back to Amsterdam. Bags travelled safe. I would recommend KLM on long-haul flights.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,,True
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,5,2014-07-10,NBO-AMS-NCL. Slightly disappointing flight from Nairobi - cramped narrow seats on B747 and in-flight entertainment completely broken (although KLM very quick to credit 6000 miles to Flying Blue account by way of apology). Difficult to sleep due to lack of legroom. Food pretty good and cabin crew friendly and efficient. Not a bad flight just poor in comparison to Kenya Airways who codeshare on the same route. Short hop from AMS-NCL efficient and easy as ever. I would stick with Kenya Airways for this route in the future.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,,True
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,10,2014-07-10,"Flight #603 (Delta #9298) 16 June 2014 Amsterdam to Los Angeles.Once aboard the airplane the trip was a very pleasant and enjoyable experience. The upper cabin of this Boeing 747 was spacious and very comfortable. The stewardesses directed us to our seats and helped stow our carry-on luggage. The meals and beverage service were delicious and generous. The fully reclining seats were the most comfortable of any airline we traveled. Throughout the trip the cabin staff showed they were interested in helping us and making us comfortable. The take-off and landing were very smooth and on-time.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,9,2014-07-03,GLA-AMS-DEL. The connecting flight to Amsterdam departed on time and arrived early. The catering on this admittedly short flight is poor. I expect more than 1 biscuit on a full fare airline! The flight to Delhi on an Airbus A320 left punctually. The service was friendly and the economy class food was actually quite good. Arrived 30 minutes early. The return flight was delayed 2 hours due to technical problems at Amsterdam. A replacement aircraft had to be found. Communication from KLM was excellent. I received a phone call an email and a text message informing me of the delay.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,,True

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,9,2014-06-23,FRA-AMS-LAX on E190 and then 744. Check-in in FRA was quick AF Lounge good. Easy Transfer in AMS but a long wait at a crowded gate before boarding due to plane change and more security checks (which is good). Seat 1A in front of Business class cabin probably the best Business class seat in the western hemisphere. Crew was amazing IFE broke down several times but after a good 2hours ok with average selection. Only real downside is the food instead of trying fancy things I suggest a better mainstream selection. With a 34seat Business class only SQ like service should be no issue with little extra investment. Wine and Drinks selection was ok with regular refill.,False,,,Business Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,,True
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,10,2014-06-16,Amsterdam (AMS) - New York (JFK) - Amsterdam (AMS). Check-in was fast and efficient. Ground staff were very friendly the KLM staff at Schiphol as well the Delta staff at JFK. Flight attendants were very efficient and friendly. Special ordered (vegetarian) meal tasted delicious! More than enough drinks were served. Inflight entertainment was excellent great choice of Dutch and international movies. Again a very positive experience with KLM.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,,True
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,8,2014-06-02,"UIO-AMS-GVA-AMS-UIO. UIO check-in and boarding were excellent but amazed me only two ground agents were using KL uniforms the rest were with common clothing helping passengers. Flight to GYE a beverage service was provided buy service excellent. At GYE boarding was also excellent and flight to AMS: excellent on board service from flight attendants dinner and breakfast provided with good food as tasty as this can be on an airplane free spirits served with dinner inflight entertainment excellent. At AMS to GVA boarding was excellent snack provided also excellent service from flight attendants. GVA check in was good not as excellent as at other flights but no boarding pass was provided for connecting flight as check-in agent told me she was unable to issue it. GVA boarding was good but not as in previous flights many people boarded when they should not. Good breakfast provided on flight to AMS and excellent service from flight attendants. Arriving at AMS only machine check-in was possible to obtain boarding pass not issued for connecting flight but pre-reserved seat one month in advance was not honored instead an aisle was provided; as a claustrophobic I always need a window seat but agents at AMS gate told me there was not a possibility to give my pre-reserved seat neither another window seat and only a not sincere ""I'm sorry"" was provided. Flight to UIO was very good flight attendants service excellent a good meal and refreshment were served free spirits given with lunch inflight entertainment was excellent and for all flights seats were good. Unluckily the aisle seat gave me a not so pleasant flight for reasons explained before this makes me question why the possibility of pre-reserved seats are open when they don't honor them? Not good customer service in this aspect. Thinking if recommending KL to others.",False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,4,,,True
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,10,2014-05-29,Flew NCL-AMS-FUK-HND with my wife and 11 month old baby then returned NRT-AMS-NCL alone. The service regarding my infant son was fantastic. He was presented with a very cute bib and given a bassinet to sleep in. The stewards also provided baby food for him and hot water so we could make up our own things for him to eat. Also they were quite happy for us to spread a blanket on the floor near the exit for him to play on. It's the third time we've used KLM with our son the second long haul trip we've made with them - and they've been wonderful and friendly every time.

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,10,2014-05-20,October 2013 I flew KLM to the UK from Vancouver Island. I was very impressed with this airline. I had tricky connections coming from the Island on the Pacific to Leeds returning from Heathrow. The service was amazing food was tasty wine great. The only criticism had nothing to do with the airline. The Schiphol airport had a weird system of going from a secure area to a non-secure area only to be frisked again to get into a different secure area. I was going to buy a bottle of duty-free whiskey for a relative but was advised that I was risking it being confiscated as I passed through multiple screens.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,,True
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,5,2014-05-19,LBA-AMS-SFO/IAD-AMS-LBA. Flew with KLM as part of our honeymoon in the USA. Both Cityhopper flights were excellent – no hassle quick decent snack and good attendants. Transfer going out was a bit tight but comfortable with a brisk walk and knowing your way through Schiphol. Boeing 747 to SFO was a little dated the IFE in my seat didn't work due to a broken audio input socket (not ideal on an 11 hour flight!). Luckily the gentleman on the aisle agreed to move to the only remaining seat on the plane had this not happened I think I would have lost my mind with boredom. Flight attendants were great - brought us a couple of glasses of champagne from Business Class for our honeymoon which was a nice touch. The journey back from Dulles was a different experience. Modern 330 again good selection of IFE. Cabin crew weren't particularly friendly - gave the impression of doing the bare minimum didn't want to ask for anything extra. Food was also a lot better going out than on return Our transfer at Amsterdam was scheduled to be 50 minutes between flights however with our first flight being 10 mins late and with taxiing etc we only made our flight to Leeds by 4 minutes with a sprint through Schiphol. There was no help in the terminal available or information to help us get there and the KLM staff at the gate made us to feel it was our fault we nearly missed the connection. The luggage wasn't so lucky – no apology was given but they did arrive at our home in Leeds later that day. I would only use KLM again if they were the most competitive - a very mixed experience and the transfer issues at Schiphol have seriously put us off.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,3,,,False
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,3,2014-05-19,Terrible experience and we haven't even gotten to the airport yet. We had assigned seats. When I checked in online one of our seats was changed to the back of the plane. We paid for upgrade to Economy comfort in the front of the plane. KLM changed the seats - no explanation no effort to make the change. We are going to have a great time at the airport tomorrow.,False,,,Premium Economy,,,3,1,,,3,,,False
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,6,2014-05-16,VIE-AMS- SFO return. We booked (my Wife and me) a Delta Ticket all flights operated by KLM which provides an overall good trip experience. Everything very good on board! Friendly Staff acceptable seating good catering. But both directions long haul flights the seats reserved during booking process were not any more reserved during check in. On AMS SFO it was a minor issue because of availability and assignment of two other seats located together. On the return it was worse. Assignment was 15 rows between the seats. To solve the topic found out during internet checkin I wanted to use the customer service hotline during check in which was not available by phone despite of 20 minute Queuing at the phone. The other communication methods offered by KLM (facebook communicator were not accessible from my mobile device using for internet check in). I solved the problem afterwards by myself finding close seats and negotiating with other passengers. All checked luggage from VIE to SFO delayed for one day because of baggage transfer problems in AMS despite of on time arrival of the aircraft VIE-AMS.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,4,,,True
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,4,2014-05-11,We bought tickets to fly round trip to Amsterdam from Oslo. My husband inadvertently pressed the wrong day for return but immediately called them within 5 minutes. They changed the date but made us pay 270 euros for the change refusing to consider an honest mistake. We received an email saying our day was changed. On the day of return we arrive at the airport and after waiting in line for 30 minutes we were told that we don't have a booking. We had to then go to another line to purchase our ticket and had to pay the difference of 270 euros again. We were told at that counter that we don't have to pay for our luggage as we are Delta frequent flyers but the lady at the luggage drop off refused to listen and made us pay 30 euros but after paying it our bag was returned due to an error so we went to another full service counter with our baggage where we were told we shouldn't have to pay for luggage. So now we have to claim the 30 euros online. So frustrated and disappointed with KLM. The ground staff were trying be helpful but were disconnected from each other.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,3,,,False
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines customer review,10,2014-05-10,I flew from LA to Amsterdam. The service and entertainment was excellent. They had many options for movies and music!
