Lights off, no agents, nothing but sad elevator music playing, completely closed down. People wandered around hopelessly looking for someone to aid them with information and there were no agents manned to the terminal, only airport employees who clearly could not assist us properly. They didn't even know when the next person would be in, at 11pm when we're realizing this issue they told us we could expect someone ""maybe around 2 am, we're really not sure."" Not that I'd expect them to truly know, they don't work for JetBlue.

"""extremely traumatizing experience""",1,2022-09-15,"My recent interactions with Jetblue and their representatives was an extremely traumatizing experience. At the airport for my flight from LA to Boston,at Los Angeles LAX JetBlue domestic check-in gate, I was denied boarding because the check-in agent made the unilateral decision that my service animal, Skylar, was not allowed on board, despite repeated attempts to show her the appropriate documentation in my possession as well as explaining our history together. Her questions and attitude towards me and my experience at the check-in were curt and dismissive to me as a person and insensitive to my condition. I imagine her frustrated attitude was due to the fact that there was a lot of confusion and chaos in the boarding area which added to everyone's discomfort. Additionally, her questions were not in line with the code of federal regulations when she demanded repeatedly for a detailed answer of what service animal I had and wanting for me to say something to justify my disability and need for her. When she considered my answers incomplete, she orally aggressively told me to get out of the line, when all I did was calmly explain my situation, and threatened repeatedly to call the police on me if I did not comply to her demands. The agent then escalated the interaction by saying I was ""no longer a JetBlue customer"" and calling her colleague (I asked to speak to her supervisor which she refused for over an hour, and only another employee came 1 whole hour later) with a member of LAPD police despite my reasonable answers in the face of her intimidating tactics. When I realized that the CRO was not there to arbitrate, rather support only the agent and not me as a customer, I had no recourse but to fly a different airline. American Airlines check-in counter was in the same area as the JetBlue check-in. The American Airlines agents accepted me as a customer when I produced my service animal documents without further questioning. When I followed up with Jetblue customer service, their agent inaccurately described the events and offered a) absolutely no compensation for what had happened, when all I asked for simply just the cash refund for the flight they refused to let me on, b) they have me stuck with flight credits that I cannot and refuse to use, c) admitted they did nothing wrong or illegal. When it comes to airline travel, I would like to know that those who are tasked with providing a pleasant experience from gate to gate are reasonable employees with proper training instead of discriminatory judgement, especially against a young woman of color with a disability service dog. Failing that, I would expect a reputable company to make right any failings in that experience.

We walked away, resigned to our situation, but then realized we didn’t know where our checked bags would be.

First red flag was our departing flight that they pushed from 10am to 6am about two weeks before the trip. Inconvenient, but not a huge deal. We accommodated it fine. Wish we would've had a little more of a heads-up, but things happen. The problem really came on our returning flight. Reported some bad weather back in the Newark area, with Jetblue sending us an email that the flight was still active and it was unlikely that it would be moved or canceled. Flight was supposed to leave at 8pm. No worries, we kept our eye on it. Checkout for our room was at 11am. 10 minutes before room service came knocking on our door to kick us out of the room, I check our flight status and find it canceled. Not only was it canceled, but there were no other flights for the day for the entire area, not for Newark, and the next nearest airport they had was over two hours away from home. Bad timing, but again, things happen. Really would've wished for more of a heads-up, considering the weather had been predicting storms the day of our return for the whole week. Called the airline for support, trying to desperately move our flight that we waived – they hadn't updated our flight in over an hour after the cancellation. Wait time for the call itself was over 2 hours, which is already ridiculous given the time crunch we were in to find another way home. Panicked and trying to fix the situation, we were met with decent service over the phone with the guy moving our flight to the next day (as it was the only one for Newark and for our area). The problem really came when we went to make a last-minute booking at our hotel following the inconvenience of the cancellation. When we called the airline again to ask for any possible reimbursement or compensation for our hotel room that we had no choice but to book another night for, we were met with an attitude and a completely unaccommodating employee that begrudgingly told us that there wasn't anything they could do, and they were not legally required to compensate for any overnight stays following cancellations. Guess we should've figured they didn't care quite at all, considering the disclaimer on their website already warns you that you're screwed on your own if they call off a flight and leave you stranded like they left us.

Consequently, we were a unable to make our flight from JFK to LHR and had to overnight which was a great inconvenience due to work and school commitments.

Round trip flight started out with a 2hour delay that turned into more than 3 hours. Our lay over was already 5hrs so we were in JFK for more than 8hrs. Everyone knows more time in an airport means more money spent on food/drinks with a 500% inflation price.

Our flight back was more than equally subpar compared to this. Again started with a 2hr delay. Connecting flight at JFK. The delay made it so we would have 10min to get from gate 20 to gate 2 in terminal 5 at JFK which is relatively close. We decided to check our luggage so we would have less to carry in order to transition from gate to gate quickly. We were told they knew we were coming and would wait. So we ran to the next gate and arrived before take off but the plane took off early and left us. This delayed us to the next day, next flight would not be leaving until 1200. We were booked a room over night and told to pick up our luggage at the baggage claim. After waiting patiently for 30 min at carousel 5, Our luggage never came. Another customer service person told us they did not know why we were told to pick up our luggage. This posed a problem for us as we had prescription medications in our checked baggage and we were told we would have to wait 2 hrs to get our luggage. At this point it was past midnight and we could not wait this long with two young kids. So we called for the shuttle service to the hotel and waited again patiently for 30 min, we decided to call again, turns out the shuttle picked up one passenger and left even though he was told we had four in our party.

JetBlue then changed the flight time (5 times) and the plane which meant we ended up with no seats. When I tried to select the seats, the computer kept saying I had to pay for them. I called up and waited on the phone for an hour - no one ever picked up. Then I went to the online chat and eventually (after an hour and a half ended up with new seats but we weren’t sitting together). They told me I could ask the person to move when I boarded the plane as they couldn’t move someone’s seat (ironic as they had already moved us from the seats we bought!). The worst part, however, was arriving at JFK at 3 am (they had moved our original 10 am flight to 6 am) as they said we needed to arrive 3 hours early or we missed risking our flight. They were right because check in is ab absolute disaster. There are hordes of people everywhere - my son lived in Kenya for a while and he said that this was a much, much worse experience than Nairobi airport. And that’s saying something! It took us two hours to check in and get through security - awful. Once we got on the plane, I asked the woman to move to the row in front so I could sit with my children. A window seat for a window seat. She refused and then started swearing at me. The steward then said she has a right not to move - which is obviously true but I’ve been in the same situation and have always moved so that families can be together. The steward was incredibly rude to me - I’ve literally never been spoken to like that by a crew member in my life. For the positive, the seat is comfortable. That’s literally the only positive thing I can say. I will never, ever fly Je Blue again.

The next employee informed us that JetBlue put both tickets under my husbands ticket number and that we had to contact JetBlue to get them to reissue the tickets correctly. After being on hold for 2 1/2 hours to talk to a representative to try and resolve the issue; mind you the ticket desk was closing and we were potentially going to miss the flight due to a major JetBlue error to our flight tickets. My husband finally got through to a gentleman who was able to quickly fix the issue 10 minutes after the ticket desk closed. The Qatar employee was amazing holding the ticket counter open for us 10 minutes after it closed, hoping this could get resolved and gladly rushed us to the plane.  At the resort my husband was in contact with the JetBlue customer service messenger. He wanted to check and make sure our tickets home would be correct and that there would be no issues with our return flight. We were reassured that all the issues with our tickets were resolved and we would have any issues at the airport. When we arrived at the ticket counter at Male we were immediately informed that there was a major issue with our tickets. Imagine our surprise that there was another JetBlue error after we were reassured twice that everything with our tickets were fixed! We were informed that there was no ticket for me, that it was cancelled by Jetblue and that my husbands ticket was inactive and the way to fix that was to contact JetBlue customer service.

"""It is beyond shocking to see JetBlue fail so badly""",2,2021-08-27,"Below outlines a series of customer service failures from JetBlue that erode hard won customer trust and from which it is hard to recover: 1) I got notified less than 90 min before flight #2288 from Newark to ACK was to take off that it was cancelled. No explanation given just a cancellation notification with a rescheduled flight for the next day. Cost to me: 2.5 hours of travel time to and from airport ($100+) and missed work time. 2) My rebooked flight leaving Newark at 10.10a bound for ACK switched gates 2x in the span of an hour with no text notification or phone call, causing me to miss my flight and go through different security lines 3x in an attempt to reach the right gate (others experienced this same problem). Again the cost to me and others (time and money) is significant. Details are as follows: I arrived at 8.45a went through security to get to the assigned gate 18, only to learn via my e-boarding pass that the gate had changed to gate 21. This required me to go to a different part of the airport with another security check in. I did this and arrived at the new gate 21 only to learn when I tried to board that the flight had been changed back to gate 18. I raced back to the other part of the airport passing through another security check point only to be told the gate 18 was now closed (it was 10a) and that I missed my flight. To be clear, I did not get a txt msg or a phone call notification of the gate change and my e-boarding pass still had gate 21 listed. Reinforcing the lack of value and respect that Jet Blue has for its customers was the $50 credit I received at 9.45am. This does not begin to cover the costs to me for Jet Blue’s failures over the past 24 hours and shows an utter disrespect for my time or patronage. It is beyond shocking to see JetBlue fail so badly.

They split our family up with a 8yo, to move this to the front, finally got to JFK had three minutes to get on another plane in New York, then being told by another Jet Blue agent so rudely don’t worry this is an international flight you will get your bag however being the law we never boarded the flight with our bags. Arrived in DR are bags were lost, they never made the flight. Went to the so-called baggage claim there the JetBlue agent wrote everything out on the paper. And obviously messed up there because the next day we got an email saying our bags was being sent to Punta Cana however the moment when it arrived there they sent it to the wrong resort. In the meanwhile we were told that they were going to be reimbursed for the items that we bought we had to spend $80 in taxi fees to get to the ""Grocery store"" to find out that they don’t sell clothing our size!

They cancel our reconnecting flight as we are not going to be there in time and rebook it for the 14th.

Because I planned on bringing my family I had to book my own flight out of pocket. So on Friday June 25th, 2021 I opted to join Jet Blue's ""True Blue"" program. When selecting my fare I specifically selected the Blue package and added insurance for both seats and upgraded to ""even more"" seats. Also reserved a spot under my seat for a cat. The grand total was $1,139. Fast forward to Tuesday June 29th, 2021. I received a notice from my supervisor that everyone in my shop who was suppose to fly out on July 6th gad their trip postponed effective immediately. I called to verify the bad news. Then I immediately went onto JetBlue and logged in and canceled my itinerary. I has the understanding that since I opted to pay extra for the insurance and other extras that my flight expenses would be covered if I canceled. I did after all plan for this trip for a month in advance. Took a whole paycheck and then some to make this happen. I'm not rich. To me a grand is a hefty sum of money.

At this point I had no idea how to tell if my flight was or was not refunded. I never saw any disclaimer or big print warning me about purchasing a none refundable ticket. I was then informed by email that $830.80 would be refunded but only in the form of a Jetblue travel credit. I had an anxiety attack at this point. So I decided to give JetBlue a call. Had to wait for 2 hours and 52 minutes just to get ahold of a rude women. She lectured me on how it's my fault because I purchased a nonrefundable ticket and went on about how great travel credit is. I pleaded with her to do something so I could get my money back. She pretty much said I'm not getting it back. I did some research online. Transportation.gov. They pretty much side with the airlines and they determine that if you had to cancel your flight (regardless of the reasons) then your not entitled to a refund in the form of money. So it seems I'm screwed. We are screwed. The government backs the airlines. The airlines will keep my $1,139.80 and they will sell the seats to someone else and make double the profit. Unbelievable. I feel hopeless. The shipyard can't do anything for me even though they are the ones who postponed our trip. It's not fair.  I won't be on the flight and I canceled a week in advance.

We flew with JetBlue before and during the peak of COVID, but the masks were never that big of an issue to be constantly repeated over and over again. She kept on repeating that you can’t have your mask down and your face has to be covered and that when you bought a ticket with JetBlue you agreed to it and threatening that if people put their masks down there will be police waiting for them at the gate when we land, and that is actually what happened to some people as we landed and started deplaning. The tone in which she was saying these things was rude and demanding, she was not polite. Personally for me, as well as for many other people I’m sure, this made this flight a total nightmare. Also, when we travelled SAC - JFK - PUJ, and PUJ - JFK - SAC, the flights we’re always late but at least an hour.

They say by FAA rules they cannot fly today. We are rescheduled for the next morning. Luckily we live nearby. We go home and show up again the next morning only to find that they never fixed the plane. Never attempted to fix the plane. Plane sat at the airport and they supposedly had to fly mechanics in the fix the plane, and decided to fly those mechanics in at 6am that morning. Truth? Who knows. Doesn’t make a lot of sense.

The plane arrived and we were to take off at 11:53 am instead of 9:20 am. As the customers were boarding, someone made an “off the cuff” remark to the pilot who was greeting passengers.

They then waited until 1.30 in the morning to cancel it. We then had to get a hotel and try to find a new flight. Guess what, according to Jetblue we can't get home until Thursday night maybe because it would be standby. While my family slept for a few hours, I continued to be on a 3 hour hold until 5.30 in the morning for them to only tell us that we could get a flight to New York and then stay the night there and fly to Detroit on Thursday.

"""Good bye JetBlue""",2,2021-04-03,"Not Verified |  I used to think so highly of Jet Blue, but after this most recent experience, I have two words for Jet Blue: never again. Jet Blue has recently partnered with American Airlines, something I only discovered when I made a reservation in March via the Jet Blue website and discovered that I was actually flying American both both going and coming. And it was fine. No complications. I needed to return to Chicago for Easter weekend and booked through Jet Blue again. I booked my tickets from New York to Chicago via the Jet Blue website. (I never use sites such as Priceline etc.) My ticket going from New York to Chicago was a Jet Blue flight, and the return flight is an American Airlines flight. Now here is the kicker, and the reason I will not be using Jet Blue in the future: I was *not* able to check in online 24 hours before my first flight from New York to Chicago. I repeatedly received an error message stating that the check-in could not be completed and that I should CONTACT A CREW MEMBER. I phoned Jet Blue three times on the day before my flight and asked three reps about why I could not check in. All three indicated that my ticket was in good order, confirmed, with no problems. The second service person offered to give me a seat assignment, for which I thanked her. All three told me to chrck in at an airport kiosk. And that's what I tried to do, when I arrived at the chaotically busy Jet Blue area of JFK 2 hours before my flight. I could not check in at the kiosk. I received the same error message and was instructed to locate a crew member. So I went to the Jet Blue kiosk help desk, which was extremely busy. I waited in line and finally had my turn. The woman at the service desk could not check me in. There was some kind of error with the ticket, the nature of which I was never able to discover. She said she had to call someone and asked me to step to one side while she assisted other people. Twenty minutes passed, and the forty minutes. I still had to go through security, and I was becoming worried about missing my flight. I tried to ask the woman at the desk if she would put a note on my record stating that I had arrived for my flight in case I missed my flight and had to rebook. She snapped that she was doing me a favor by making that call for me, because she could have sent me to another service desk. In her defense, that Jet Blue area was pandemonium. Finally, at 8:30 a.m., a half hour from my 9:00 a.m. flight, she handed me a boarding pass. I made it through security and arrived at the gate as the last group was boarding. I was just in time, after having arrived TWO HOURS EARLY for a domestic flight. And now, today, I am trying to check in for my return flight from Chicago to LaGuardia, and neither the Jet Blue website nor the American Airlines (partner) website recognizes my record locator or ticket number. Thus, I am yet again unableto check in for my return flight. And I am once again on hold with Jet Blue, listening once again to the worst possible hold music (c'mon Jet Blue, really?), and I've yet again been on hold for over 40 minutes.

The plane was then 40 minutes late, without announcement, update or apology from staff. When boarding began, the woman at the gate got on the speaker and shouted during Mosaic boarding that she would cease all boarding entirely if people did not “clear the boarding area”.

Nobody, however, was blocking the lane whatsoever, and the single mosaic member had already boarded without any problem. When we all got on the plane, it was boiling hot and completely full- no empty seats for COVID at all. The staff was rude and unaccommodating throughout the flight.

After we got everyone squared away and ready for the flight, we walked to our gate and arrived there at 9.07. We were told that the door closed at 9.05. We asked if there was any way they could let us on the flight, but they turned us away. Was it our fault for not being there on time? Absolutely. We could make a number of excuses for ourselves, but, ultimately, it was on us to be there before the door closed. However, JetBlue did not make any announcements in the kids' area, which is in their own terminal. My wife and I were paying attention to the announcements and we would have heard the call for final boarding had they played it in there. In the end, we were stuck at the airport for an extra 6 hours, which was very difficult, to say the least. Not a fun experience.

"""sit around and wait for 9 hours again""",1,2019-12-14,"Atlanta to Quito via Ft Lauderdale with Jetblue Airways. I have never written a bad review on any airline before, I have flown with at least 10 airlines internationally, and domestically. That has changed drastically because of this airline. My family and I had never flown with this airline before, but it was cheaper by a landsline so we decided to try it out. About a month later another family member was interested in going so we went ahead and booked her on the same flight since there were still availabilities. Fast forward a week before our departure, my aunt was horribly injured, and she's 84 years old. I call the airline and the woman I spoke with was adamant that because it was a medical excuse we would receive a full refund as long as we turned in a doctor's note. Now, before I even start on how they treated the refund, I would like to talk on my personal interaction on the airline. This alone would have spurred me to write a review even without the second part of our dealings. So our first flight gets delayed one hour, then 45 minutes, then another 45, and we are counting the minutes to when we would land because our second flight to leave the country was 3 hours after our first flight should have landed. Now, I have traveled around the world numerous times, I lived abroad so I have dealt with my fair share of delays. But, and I emphasize the but, the airline always contacted the next flights when dealing with delays in order to work with everyone's schedules. I have had many airlines delay the next flight for me enough that passengers wouldn't miss the flight going out. So coming off this rant, we miss the next flight, by 5 minutes. Do they call ahead and delay the next flight 30 minutes knowing there were connections? No. Now, that wouldn't even be a big deal normally because they get you on the next flight, but they only had one a day to Ecuador. So why did they not delay the flight knowing now they were going to have to put up multiple people in hotel rooms if they did not? Do not ask me, I sure do not know! We have to wait around an hour for a shuttle to take us to a hotel, then got next day to sit around in the airport for 9 hours. Pretty much missing a full day of work and a full day of vacation. They do not give a meal on an international flight, and you have to pay for any extras such as earphones, pillows, blankets, etc. which I have never seen before. Fast forward, fly back into the states and once again have to sit around and wait for 9 hours again! They must really love the number nine! When booking the next flight out (once they made us miss our second flight) the man behind the desk had the gall to ask me why we missed the flight because only if it was their fault would they put us in a hotel. Only if it was their fault. Then he laughed and said ""how lucky we were"" because there were only 3 seats on the flight the next day (meaning if there weren't we would have been stranded another day? I definitely did not feel lucky!) So on top of that all they refuse to issue me a refund back on my card even though we have a doctor's note because we canceled the flight.

Scheduled departure was 12.59pm, and was changed to 6.07pm. The flight attendant announced to all of us on the plane prior to departure that we would all be entitled to and would be receiving a $150 credit. I even confirmed with her during the flight just to make sure I heard correctly. 7 days had passed and I still hadn’t received the email with instructions on where to find my credit (they told us we would be receiving one within 7 days). After being on hold multiple times, I reached out to customer service on their website and received some answers (photos attached). I was told that we would only be receiving $100 because it was weather related and that’s what the airport told them. I received many emails notifying me of the delayed (it delayed 4 times), and never was it stated that it was due to weather. Weather was not a factor that day for flying. Either in DC or Orlando, or anywhere in between. It also doesn’t state anywhere in their terms that you will not receive compensation if your delay is weather related, however this is what customer service told me. When I told her that the flight attendant told us all it would be $150, she said “I don’t know why they would say that”.

"""have zero interest in helping customers""",2,2019-09-28,"I will never fly JetBlue again. Two major issues: 1) Customer Service, especially the ""Help Needs"" service desk at the airport in JFK are rude, unprofessional and have zero interest in ""helping customers"". After arriving in a wheelchair - post surgery, I was informed by Check-In that I was too late for the flight, the plane doors were closed. They sent me to the Help Needs counter to schedule me for a later flight. While going to the ""Help"" desk the PA announcement was made for the boarding of ""my"" flight. The Check-In rep had lied to me. They intentionally made me miss my flight to LAX. 2) My family was in the process of relocating from NYC to elsewhere. My daughter had to re-schedule the flight she and I were due to take together on Sept. 17 because of a related moving problem. We re-booked her. It was a day of horror at the airport for her yesterday. JetBlue employees did everything they could to delay and harass my daughter because I called the 800 number and tried to get a reduced rate on my daughter's unused plane ticket. After paying for the initial one way ticket-$233.30, which they did at first offer to allow a ""free"" (replacement) plane trip, I wound up paying an additional $255.00 plus $75.00 because because they said she had ""missed"" her flight and was traveling the next day, she was required to pay more money for her ticket. JetBlue ""canceled"" her flight because they said she had intentionally missed her flight while at the airport. This was a lie. She missed her flight while they played games about getting her a refund and getting her on the next flight to LAX. Then when she left the ""Help"" desk my daughter went to the TSA Pre-check entrance where they told her she had too many bags to go through the TSA pre-check. (She then returned to check one of her two bags with JetBlue, against her better judgement ($30.00). The bag went to LAX without my daughter because, then they said my daughter did not have a TSA pre-check number (this was a JetBlue lie to get her to go on the regular line not the pre-check line). She has a TSA pre-check number. As a result of them searching her, they said they were going to call the police-she ""had something under her belt"". My daughter said ""sure, search me"". Of course they found no reason to have delayed her. Result? She missed her second flight to LAX. My daughter is not a terrorist. JetBlue staff at JFK at the ""Help"" desk was most unhelpful, disgustingly rude and offensive. I always traveled JetBlue. The way they treated me and my daughter was worse than contemptible. They do not care about their customers. I do not care to be so poorly treated by employees of JetBlue Airlines. All the good that I ever experienced in previous travel with JetBlue was canceled by these employees this past week.

I asked “well what happens if he goes anyway?”, which then received an eye roll and him walking away from us.

"""Worst customer service ever""",1,2019-08-15,"Fort Lauderdale to New York JFK on July 31st, 2019. The flight was scheduled to depart FLL at 8;32 PM EST and arrive at JFK at roughly 11:36 PM. During the morning on that day, I went online to check the status of the flight. To my surprise, I found out the flight was delayed for nearly three hours! It now read that the flight was scheduled to depart at 11:10 PM and arrive at 2:07 AM. I was shocked at how long this delay and attempted to find out the reason why. However, the Jetblue website was unclear in explaining why. This was urgent because I had a connecting international flight out of JFK from a different airline that was scheduled to depart on-time at 2:30 AM. Because of this situation, I figured I would get to the airport early so I could maybe get on an earlier flight to New York. When I arrived at FLL, I went towards the Jetblue customer service desk. After over 40 minutes of standing in line, I was finally able to talk to a customer service representative. I explained to the representative my entire situation and he said he would try to see what he can do. After 20 minutes of searching on his computer, he said that he could get me on an 8:30 PM Jetblue flight to New York was also delayed and originally scheduled to leave at 2:00 PM. I asked if there were seat available and he said there were. I was hopeful for a few moments but that ended when he stopped talking and went on his phone. After some time, he seemed to make a call but never actually said anything on the phone. After over an hour, he finally told us that this flight that would have saved my entire situation was completely sold out. I had no idea when it was sold out or why it wasn't sold out when the representative told me he could get me seats on it. I asked him if there was anything else that was available and he just said no. I asked him what the reason was for the delay and he said there were thunderstorms in NY causing all flights to NY to get held back. At this point, I was frustrated as I could have used another airline to buy a ticket to NYC instead of wasting my time with Jetblue customer service. However, it was too late and it appeared that all other flights to NYC and Newark that would have fit my time frame were unavailable.

It was as if the airline did not want us to cancel and switch to another airline irrespective of the inconvenience to the passenger. Everyone involved in this clear deception did so with a pleasant smile on their face which leads me to conclude the reason for the delay was incompetence rather than deception. We finally decide to pay for a very expensive last minute ticket to an alternate airport that was closer to our destination. Now catch this. Even though a $250 payment was promised per the passenger bill of rights, since we were delayed over 8 hours, if you cancelled your reservation even at the last minute to get on an alternate flight you would lose the payment. So we got a new ticket but did not cancel the old ticket since the payment would exceed the ticket cost. We have had several severe delays on JetBlue recently. The latest 8 hours to fix a sensor was the last straw. Clearly this is a severe management problem.

"""Awfully bad experience""",1,2019-07-07,"❎ Not Verified | Ft Lauderdale to San Francisco. Awfully bad experience. I travelled from FLL to SFO with my family. 1. Jet Blue prices grow much faster than other companies when you add just the basic option, in my case, it was +50%, that puts this company to the same category with American Airlines, United, etc. 2. For this price you have service, that is worse than the appropriate low-cost one. In FLL the terminal where Jet Blue operates is far away from the rental cars parking, comparing to United, that operates in the same terminal. And even if Jet Blue tails and admits it, you can't get anything - no business lounge, no paid hotels, absolutely nothing. 3. I came to the terminal and printed the boarding passes one hour prior to the takeoff. But the infrastructure in the airport, that works for Jet Blue, is so awfully bad that I missed the flight. The system doesn't print tags for luggage and nobody assists passengers. Finally, after a few attempts, we came to the service desk to print them, it was 50 minutes prior to takeoff. Then we spent over 20 minutes printing the tags, it's easy to see the timestamps on the tags. Finally, they didn't give us all our tags, one was missing! People were extremely slow then there was a glitch in the software, then the printer didn't work. Finally 25 minutes prior to takeoff we came to the security check, where we supposed to have a separate line. We didn't get it even after we told that we're missing the flight. The gate was closed strictly on time and we had to go to the Jet Blue service desk. 4. People at the desk saw right from the beginning all our statuses in the system and agreed that the was no our fault in this situation. They were not able to offer anything earlier than in 24 hours, but helped to identify all our luggage tags numbers and initiated the refund (appreciate it, however, I haven't got it so far). Everything else became our problem. 5. We tried to discuss the situation with the manager on site, but this step was absolutely useless. We were waiting for him for 40 minutes, a family of five people including a five-year-old child, that already supposed to be sleeping on the plane. He told us that he's sorry about what happened but didn't offer anything to compensate our losses (time and money for the tickets that we had to buy in the last minute and hotel). He didn't say anything regarding the enormous timeslots for the typical operations, that we saw. His point was that even if passengers paid for some services to get faster to the gate, one hour is not enough and we had to come earlier. But passengers should be notified about these critical issues in advance and have clear recommendations. And it doesn't mean that airlines are free from any obligations to support passengers on site. Nobody notified me that I had to plan 30-35 for each operation. I would never go for it. Overall conclusion: No way. Doesn't make sense to pay for the service if you can't get it. We had many examples of good and bad services, but this one is the worst experience that we had. All companies have problems but this time were had no support at all. In case of any troubles with Jet Blue you have reasons and explanation, but no help. They can tell you who's fault it is but they can't provide you anything after that happened.

Imagine that?? Honestly, I think they just made up any old excuse. Regardless, I received an email 20 minutes later (approximately 6 hrs. before scheduled departure time) stating that they rescheduled our flight for 2 days later. Now there's a genius answer to their problem. Our family spent over $10,000 for a 2 week vacation to Florida only to have an airline cut the vacation short by 2 days because of their total screw up. Wow! Needless to say, we were not able to find any flights for 5 passengers and had to drive from Syracuse, NY to Orlando, FL. No big deal... it's only an 18 hour drive!

This changed on this flight from JFK to Charlotte that was delayed 6 hours. Now, we all know delays are possible and when they are based on weather or things not in an airlines control, you learn to deal with it. However, our actual plane was right there at JFK but it first had to take a plane load of people to Nantucket which apparently had a ground stop. The delay for that route went from 30 minutes, to an hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours. You see, instead of just cancelling the Nantucket flight and taking the us to Charlotte, we had to wait for that other flight on the plane we needed. Now considering this is their main hub, there has to be an extra plane and pilots (I'm told by someone in the industry that is typical). But let's put that aside, weather was good at JFK and weather was good in Charlotte, the issue is with an unrelated route which we now had to wait 6 hours. When you take the 6 hour wait, arriving at the airport an hour early and the 2 hour flight I essentially could have driven to Charlotte faster. Now consider their useless Jetblue 'Bill of Rights', since the ground stop was in Nantucket I was exempt from any money. So basically Jetblue will never give you money back, they will blame anything and anyone for their awful service. I contacted customer service who are useless, asked for a supervisor who after an hour gave up. I finally just emailed a list of execs at Jetblue and did get a useless response that did not address their issues.

My mom is a senior citizen that has a serious medical condition that is triggered when she is under high level of anxiety or stress and it could cause her to go into the hospital. Her dog does not only help prevent a medical issue, but also lets her know when one is coming so she can take her medicine. I tried to talk to the Supervisor and she apologized for the confusion their airline may have caused, but was not willing to work with us in any way. I explained we had two weeks before my mom's return flight so if they would have told us in Florida to get another form filled out by her doctor we would have without any problem.

For hours they knew that there wasn't going to be a crew to fly us back as the crew timed out do to weather in NY and the jetblue employees chose to lie to everyone for hours pretending like we would be flying out that night. When our plane finally arrived at 11pm they told us it would be a quick turnaround and they would get us on board knowing fully well there was no crew. Instead of letting everyone know what was going on so that people could make alternate travel plans or even go home to get sleep to get on another flight in the morning they decided to just lie. And as the crew was getting off the plane the flight attendant has a smirk on her face and the pilot answers a passenger telling her they knew they had timed out. We lost our rental car and non refundable tickets we had to events in NY. Fast forward to the next morning with the next flight they put us on after getting 4 hours of sleep, we're told our plane has arrived but the captain hasn't given the all clear to board.

So, I figured I could be fair and give them another try later on as they did give me a $100 flight credit, per their bill of rights.

We ate a small breakfast thinking we could easily get to our destination as scheduled and eat an early dinner once in LA. The delay made the on flight snacks barely adequate and we were starving once we arrived. There are no healthy snacks, the only offerings are potato chip type bags with carbohydrate and fat loaded ingredients.

Jetblue closed the doors 1 minute prior to us getting to our gate. We ran to the desk however the gentlemen informed us we were too late the doors have already been closed. I informed him the pilot was aware we were minutes late however he said that’s too bad once the doors are closed they are closed. The customer service received at the help desk was ridiculous.

They didn't even charge for the ticket change. To top this off, when we arrived at the gate, the flight attendant who recognized us from our previous flight came up to say hello. He asked us what seats we had and after realizing we were way in the back, he immediately changed our seats to the ""Even More Leg-Room"" seats without us even asking for it. No charge either! He even invited us to board first.  I appreciate these gestures that the JetBlue staff have done for me and my dad in this rather difficult time for us.

Agents on the phone were no help, only offering a flight leaving at 9:25am as an option. They claimed the flight was canceled for mechanical issues; somehow I don't believe that and this was some sort of cost saving cancellation.

I asked the stewardess to speak with the captain as there were around 15 of us that had our Worcester flight 2020 canceled and were rebooked on these flights. I dreaded the thought of missing my connection because of the plane's lack of water and need for a hand-sanitizer delivery that took 40 minutes. The stewardess returned and said she spoke with the captain who would try to hold the flight. About 10 minutes before our landing another stewardess went on the intercom and told all theBoston bound passengers to relax because our gate was right next to Boston flight 660's E2, and that the plane would wait for us as the captain had called ahead. That was a major relief to hear that news. She also explained that we'd be let off the plane first ahead of other passengers to expedite our plane change. This was also a relief to hear considering my carry-ons and precious kid cargo. I nearly texted my father to pick us up at Logan (he was driving from N. Grafton in Worcester county), but I hesitated, wanting to be 100% sure. Well, unfortunately my apprehension proved deserved. When the door to the plane opened there wasn't any parting of the seas to let us through.

I then looked out the plane's window - there wasn't any plane at E2 - flight 660 had already taken off! I walked down the gate corridor completely bewildered; the crew members were still nowhere to be seen. Upon exiting the gate, the JetBlue ticket agent handed me a new set of tickets.

I spoke to several passengers who were all going to very different destinations, Seattle, Charleston, Boston, etc and all flights were cancelled which tells me that the weather issue was not the destination or on route, it was the source (New York), and seeing that there was actually no rain an just some clouds, it seems ludicrous that they would have us believe that the flights were cancelled due to bad weather.  The fact that these sorts of things must happen every day, so for me to spend 6 hours in a airport, sorting everything from flights, to accommodation, to taxis, to my lost luggage which up to today no one had logged a ticket for, is absolutely unacceptable and it boggles my mind that they are still operating with this level of inefficiency, lack of procedure and incompetence.",False,,Business,Economy Class,New York to Seattle,July 2017,,,,1,1,,False,

In the spring I began making plans to attend my daughters graduation from grad school in Vermont. Using Expedia, I searched for a reasonable fare and decided on JetBlue. The fares I purchased included a flight from O'Hare to JFK with a short layover at JFK and then a flight to Vermont. The same package in reverse was available for us three days later when we wanted to return home. So in all I purchased three fares, one for myself, my husband and youngest daughter and altogether, we were scheduled for two flights to get to Vermont and two flights to return to Chicago. On the drive into O'Hare on the morning of 6/22/2017 I received a text message that the flight to JFK and then the connecting flight to Vermont had been cancelled. There was no reasonable explanation given. Here were all my hopes of getting to Vermont cancelled in a brief, cold text message. I called Expedia who helped me arrange for another flight to Burlington but they also told me to keep the flight with JetBlue for my return flight on 6/24/2017 as they hadn't cancelled those two flights. Bad idea. I should of cancelled it and made changes right then but I thought this kind of event was something unusual. On Saturday 6/24/2017 when we went to the airport in Vermont to depart, the JetBlue flight was delayed for around four hours. JetBlue arranged for us to get a later connecting flight to Chicago that was suppose to leave around 6.00. When we got to JFK, the flight to Chicago was on the board and it said ""on time"". I think we may have been there an hour or so and suddenly the status of the flight was changed to ""cancelled"". Again, we got no answers or help from JetBlue's customer service with the exception of telling us where we could pick up our checked bag in the airport and rescheduling a plane the next day that we later learned would supposedly leave some time around 2.00 in afternoon and get us home by 9.30 after two connecting flights. Fearing we would be stranded in yet another city we made other arrangements. Essentially, we were left stranded at JFK by JetBlue. There were no available hotel rooms this weekend as it was Pride weekend in New York City and all the hotels were booked. We searched for rooms, Expedia searched for us and after using the services at JFK we learned there was nothing available. We were given no help or direction from JetBlue that was meaningful or helpful in our situation. We had never been to New York and only expected our stay to be a brief one as a connecting flight. No room, no reciprocity with another carrier. So to be clear, three out of the four flights we had arranged months in advance were cancelled by JetBlue with just the flick of a text message. I will never fly JetBlue ever again. I am utterly appalled for what passed as service and the willingness to leave people stranded with no assistance. There are few words to describe the service we received from JetBlue over this weekend but it was punctuated with an attitude of ""aww too bad"" and your on your own.

The earliest they'd be able to get me out of JFK on the 26th would be 4pm, so I changed my flight to depart Austin on the 26th. The same flight on the 26th was again delayed from 5:06pm to 5:50 pm and I called to ensure that I would still make my connection. The phone agent confirmed I would make the connection so I drove to Austin to catch my flight. While waiting at the gate the flight was delayed again, now to 6:25pm. Attendant at the gate confirmed that I would make my connection. As I was boarding the plane I was told that I'd have to check my carry-on. I explained that I had a tight connection in JFK, but was reassured by the gate that it wouldn't be a problem. As we approached JFK the flight had to circle until we were diverted to refuel in Philly for return to JFK. Once we finally landed at JFK it was 12:30am and thought I would have time to catch my connecting flight however, no one from Jetblue met the plane and the crew did not provide connection information. I looked at the departure boards but my flight was not listed. As I attempted in vain to search the gates for my departing flight and access the flight status option on the website (which did not work) I went to the previous gate I was told the flight would be at before it had been delayed several times, but it was not there and the only manned ""Just Ask"" station in the terminal was in close proximity but with twenty people in line. So I called the 1-800 number and it was obvious that the phone agent was not well trained and tried to inform me that my next flight was my departure flight on the 29th and all my previous flights had departed on time. She had no idea that my flights had been delayed and informed me that the only available flight was 8:36am that morning. I asked then why had I received texts that my connecting flight was not departing until 01:07am and she couldn't explain it but asked if I wanted to change my flight as if I had a choice. When I said yes, she stated that she would have to get a supervisor to allow her to make the change. That process took about 30 minutes and at the conclusion she told me that I needed to talk to an employee at the terminal to confirm the information she'd provided me. When I finally got to the front I was told that the flight had indeed been delayed and that I could have caught that flight and my bag had made it on the flight. Why wouldn't the flight be on the departure screens? So now I have no access to my bag during the 8 hour layover. To top it off, I requested to talk to a supervisor and was told that someone would come talk to me but it could take a while, I have 8 hours to spend here anyway so said sure I'll wait. Two hours later I was told that the supervisor would not be able to speak with me and that if I truly wanted to speak with one that I would need to exit security and search for one at the ticket counter. Had I known, I would have canceled my travel plans. First and last time I'll fly on Jetblue.",False,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Syracuse via New York JFK,May 2017,3,2,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",2,1,,False,3

That was wrong. Flying home on JetBlue was terrible. Full flight and the TV's did not work. It was a new plane and they did not work.

It was then that one of the JetBlue staff members rudely interrupted our conversation to chime in, ""you know gates do change and you are responsible to know about these changes"". Upon boarding, we were shocked to see that our overhead storage compartment was completely taken. We had paid extra money to receive the ""extra legroom seats"" and we were seated in row 1. It appeared that all of the passengers seated behind us had placed their luggage in the first 6 rows of overhead compartments. I decided to take a seat and wait for everyone to be seated so I could walk to the back of the plane to place my bags, this seemed like the only option being that my wife and I had two carry on bags with absolutely no free compartments in sight.

"""one of the worst experiences""",1,2016-04-09,"✅ Verified Review |  Washington Dulles to New York JFK with Jetblue. This was probably one of the worst experiences I had in over 20 years of regular flying. From the beginning till the very end. We experienced a delay due to weather conditions. However, the ground staff was not helpful at all. A lot of us had connecting flights, and we asked that they contact the airlines we were flying with to check the status. They refused. We asked that they give us the telephone numbers of the airline so that we, the passengers, can contact them. They refused. And as the wifi was not working in the terminal, it was difficult to get the numbers. We got it, despite the refusal of the JetBlue staff. We asked to be rerouted to other airlines who were taking off. They refused. We had over 6 hours delay, and as they refused to contact the connecting international airlines, we missed (9 of us) the connection by few minutes. And then, the real nightmare started. In JFK, they were incapable of locating our luggage. It took them hours to tell us that finally, they can't locate it and we need to come back the next day. As there were no seats available on my connecting flight for few days, I needed to get my luggage. And when we were trying to rebook, the people standing at the counters would not take us, as 'they had to be free for first class passengers, in case they came, so they could not serve us'. For a low cost airline, this sounds like a joke. The result was a long queue before one of the counter, and at the other, the woman starring and not accepting any passenger. After 6:30 hours delay and additional 3 hours of trying to figure out what to do, this was a particularly bad experience. The next day, they were incapable of saying where the luggage is. I lost the whole day until I finally got my luggage. I heard all type of excuses: as my luggage was initially checked through to the final destination, it was difficult to locate it (do they know how t use bar codes?), or it was not clear where the luggage was, etc. I finally got my luggage thanks to the assistance from the other airline, who tried to help, as JetBlue was incapable. But they clearly said that this was a JetBlue problem. I also asked JetBlue to give me a confirmation about the delay, so that my insurance can assist me. They refused. They said that my insurance (from Europe) had to call the 0800 number to get a confirmation. But they are not providing a confirmation. I spoke to not less than 4 different people, including the one claiming to be the supervisor, they refused. Throughout the whole nightmare, the one thing that they kept saying consistently was 'I cannot', 'I don't know', 'It is not JetBlue's problem', 'it is not possible'. There was no customer service, no desire to help, no desire to find a solution whatsoever, from pretty much everybody working at this company.

When I boarded - after the flight was delayed twice - there wasn't room on the plane for my computer bag. The flight attendant told me I would have to check it. After I suggested that we see if people can put a small bag under the seat in front of them, he responded saying that my bag would be checked, in a rude fashion. He said he didn't have to deal with me and called security. Not only is that not called for as I was no threat to anyone, but embarrassing. The security guard came down and even told the flight attendant that everything seemed fine. The flight attendant got the pilot and told him he didn't want me on the plane. I am currently sleeping at the airport and can't get home until tomorrow now. I am upset and embarrassed and the show the flight attendant put on. I was frustrated about the delay and bag situation, but certainly was not any kind of threat. The security guard have me a cot to sleep on. He was very nice.

The inbound plane arrived a little late and we saw the ground crew (who was also the ticket counter crew) scurrying around. At 11:00 p.m. one of the staff announced something (in Spanish) and you could hear some people groan. Fortunately there was a bi-lingual person near us who said, ""They just cancelled the flight."" With that Jetblue announced the flight was cancelled (at 11:30 pm) and all passengers on our flight were to proceed to Gate XYZ, so we did. Once there the non-English speaking staff asked for our passports and wisked them away. An hour later they were returned to us (haphazardly) and we were told to stand in line for buses (no explanation given) but found out we were to be taken to Baggage Claim to get our luggage. We did and got our bags. Then we lined up again (not knowing what for) to get on buses to take us to a hotel. It was now 2:00 am so we complied. We got to the hotel and waited in line again to get a room. We were told we would be taken to the airport at 1:30 to board our flight. After an awesome breakfast (not kidding) we were told we would be taken to the airport at 8:30. Then we got an email saying we were booked on the 11:00 pm flight. But leaving at 8:30 wouldn't be enough time. We called our travel agent, who advised us to just go to the airport and demand to leave. We did and Jetblue got us out. Came to find out the flight we were supposed to be on didn't leave until 6:30 the following morning!

Very comfortable and private especially when reclined with the suite door closed. The only picky comment is there tends to be some wasted space owing to the single seat configuration and the design could have accommodated a greater seat width. You're also removed from the window so mindless gazing is not really an option unless you unbuckle and lean. The perks in Mint are outstanding not just the lie-flat seat with massage feature but the food and beverage selection amenity kit service from the flight staff and the large video screen. As mentioned in previous reviews not touch screen but that didn't really detract from the experience - you couldn't even reach the screen necessarily when fully reclined. Okay selection of feature films but not VOD. The DirecTV feed is great however and really gives no reason to claim you're bored. The wi-fi complimentary at the moment was hit and miss; fairly good responsiveness when working but did suffer from numerous interruptions. Personalized and attentive service was prominent on both legs and flight time seemingly flew (no pun intended) by. At the current introductory price point Mint is outstanding value. Inevitably jetBlue will adjust their fare pricing to reflect the reality of what is offered however even at a higher cost Mint class should be seriously considered before looking at intercontinental business class on other airlines. jetBlue and its staff should be proud of the Mint product and I will look for any excuse to fly Mint class again.,False,,,,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,

Was completely surprised by this level of service in US. The only downside was the movies were not running but there was plenty of other options. The amenities kit and head set are all top notch. They give American and Virgin a run for the money and considering this service is so well priced I will be flying again!,False,,,,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True,
Jetblue Airways customer review,6,2015-01-05,In December 2014 I took two separate jetBlue flights one from SFO to JFK and then another from JFK to LAX. These flights were fairly long (5 hours) and I found the service to be quite sterile and mediocre. While it was nice that snacks and drinks were made available throughout the flight there were no healthy options aside from water and if you were not prepared to purchase a meal on board chips and cookies were basically your only options for the flight. I feel that this is standard for a flight that may be 1 or 2 hours long but for a longer 5 hour trip I expect there to be meal service included in the price of the fare. I also suffered from severe pain in my right ear during and after landing on both these flights which I had not experienced on another domestic US flight with a different airline that I had taken around the same time nor on any other flight I have had prior or after these two jetBlue ones.,False,,,,,,5,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,3,,False,
Jetblue Airways customer review,10,2015-01-05,Just arrived in NYC (LGA) from Fort Myers with my 3 kids and husband. We were really impressed by our experiences on outgoing and returning flights.

Jetblue Airways customer review,9,2014-12-18,JFK-IAD ERJ-195 The seat is nice and provides enough legroom. It was a short flight of about 50 minutes. There were personal TV which is good enough for a short flight. You can switch channels to news such as CNN. The flight has snacks and cola for complimentary. It is the best experience I have had on short flight.,False,,,,,,4,3,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,4,,True,
Jetblue Airways customer review,10,2014-12-10,"R/T JFK to LIR (Liberia Costa Rica) in Even More Space seats. The EMS seats entitle you to shorter waiting time at the TSA checkpoint which we needed since we were a little late arriving to JFK. We purchased food to bring on board but ""boxes"" are availlable. No Eat Up Cafe (fresh food) is sold on this flight. The EMS seats have lots of leg room which is great. Our flight attendants both ways were friendly and efficient and complimentary snacks and beverages available at all times. Since we were on an international flight the movies were free but they charge $3 for headphones (which I feel JB should comp for the EMS rows). Overall a great experience. We use this service twice annually to visit our home in CR.",False,,,,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True,
Jetblue Airways customer review,10,2014-11-20,Flew between New York JFK and Fort Myers. Checked in online and bag drop at JFK was quick and easy.

Jetblue Airways customer review,10,2014-11-03,Flew Mint Class from LAX to JFK and were impressed with the overall experience. We live in Asia and fly Business or First Class on some fantastic full service Asian based airlines but this Jetblue Mint experience can easily beat most of them. We took the 7am flight on a heavy 100 percent full A321 flight. The check in was smooth with a nice welcome from the ground staff. Our luggage were slightly oversize and above the max. 50 pounds allowance per piece but they were flexible on it hence we didn't need to pay the additional fees. We arrived around 5.30 am hence only a few passengers on the security check and didn't bother to use the express line. The boarding was announced at 6:15 am and the Mint passengers got to board first. We were seated in 3A and 3C which is perfect for couple even though the single suite with sliding door in front and the back of our seats row 2 and 4 were more private. The cabin crew were very helpful in explaining the Mint service seat functions and presented us with menu card. The welcome drink with or without vodka were a delight. It took us a while to learn the full features of the seat as they are so unique and not the usual features you find in other carriers. The thick blanket noise canceling headphones power point container for your phones and sunglasses are very thoughtful. The boarding was completed before 7am and the departure was on time. We got to choose 3 out of five meals prepared by Saxon+Parole which were delicious and nicely presented. The Icecream by blue marble and Mah Ze Dahr cookies in a box were of good quality. One feature we love the most is free and fast wifi as soon as we took off. The non stop TV entertainment although not AVOD was cool and we could watch it as soon as we sat down. The in-massage seat function helped us to relax and dozing off for most 5 hours and 30 minutes flight. I am 6 feet tall and I found the seat is comfortable and I was able to stretch flat out. We arrived at JFK 10 minutes earlier than scheduled and were very happy with our experience. Book early for extreme good value and highly recommend the Mint class to anyone looking for a fantastic First class experience at an affordable price.,False,,,,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Jetblue Airways customer review,9,2014-10-22,HPN-MCO. No complaints seats were roomy. Check in was easy both ways. Great entertainment as you could actually watch live TV. No meals offered (short flight). Basic refreshments. Good value!,False,,,,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Jetblue Airways customer review,10,2014-10-22,Took flight 1834 from Port-au-Prince to JFK on 10/17/14. What a great experience - almost. The personnel were exceptional. They did everything right. My seat was 1D since no one was in the exit row seats they let me move back and allowed my friend in coach to move next to me he is 6 ft 3 so that was great for him. The attendants were on their game the whole trip and got me coffee after their normal serving time without a hitch. Only problem was my seat sound connection crackled so I used the seat connection next to me. No problem as long as no one is directly next to you.,False,,,Business Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Jetblue Airways customer review,4,2014-10-20,I travel a fair amount (7-10 trips a year for biz and pleasure). I am fine with zero amenties for short hauls but I am sorry Boston - San Diego is a long flight. I paid $90 extra for leg room and was still jammed in like a sardine. There was nothing to eat except junk food (salt or sugar) or a cardboard sandwich for purchase. No free wine or beer. If I wanted a cheap blanket and pillow for the red-eye home I had to BUY it (and then had to own it) - I traveled to this business meeting with one carry on - what am I supposed to do with my new jetblue bedding? Talk about a throwaway anti-environmental business model. I had to pay for TV if I wanted it - only good thing is free wifi. I paid over $900 for the ticket. Jet Blue should not treat their transcontinental flyers like this. I would not recommend JB to anyone taking a trip longer than 90 minutes and I would only use them again if I could find no other carrier going to the destination.,False,,,,,,2,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,False,
Jetblue Airways customer review,10,2014-10-08,On board Mint class from LAX to JFK. Impressive in all aspects. Seat entertainment food and service. The other carriers better watch out.

Jetblue Airways customer review,4,2014-09-28,I recently traveled round trip from Boston to Orlando. I traveled out of Boston on September 14 2014 and we were about 20 minutes delayed leaving Boston due to the late arrival of the inbound flight. I have to say it was a great flight and the pilot made up time arriving in Orlando for an on-time arrival the crew were great plenty of legroom plenty of drinks and snacks. The overall flight to Orlando was excellent. Coming home to Boston yesterday was a different story the male flight attendant on the Orlando-Boston route was extremely rude. No smile as we boarded the aircraft no hello to the passengers just miserable. I traveled with 2 friends on board the flight and the tray table was defective and the soda went all over my friends pants. I went to ask this flight attendant for some paper towels and he rudely said get back to your seat because there was turbulence. I understand the safety protocols when it comes to turbulence but at least take initiative to the passengers requests. There was no apology from him for this defective tray table. A female flight attendant who was so nice came to our aid.,False,,,,,,5,2,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True,
Jetblue Airways customer review,3,2014-09-17,We arrived at the airport before 2pm - our flight was at 9.45 pm. Usually when you arrive so far in advance JetBlue try to accommodate you on an earlier flight with no charge. We had the chance to take the flight at 2.40pm JetBlue had space on that flight but they wanted to charge $50 per person (group of 4) instead they put us on stand by for 7 hours. I travel a lot because of my business and I have never had this issue with other airlines.,False,,,,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,3,,False,
Jetblue Airways customer review,10,2014-09-09,Flew LAX-JFK return in Mint in Aug/Sep 2014. Check in was fast and efficient although slightly hard to find the Mint line at JFK. The food is some of the best I've had inflight and beats any of the other American airlines I've flown hands down. The seat was slightly narrow but the adjustable firmness and subtle massage made up for it. Warm and efficient friendly cabin crew were very helpful but unobtrusive. Flight to JFK departed 50 minutes late but landed on time. Entertainment system is not on demand and the DirecTV has so many advertisements it is infuriating. The feature movies were ad free though. Overall a very good airline who I would definitely fly with again.,False,,,,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,True,
Jetblue Airways customer review,9,2014-09-06,Flew on Jet Blue 1732 from Bermuda to JFK on Sunday 31/8/2014. Boarding was speedy well organised and efficient with everyone boarded and the plane doors closed 20 minutes ahead of schedule. The flight left Bermuda 15 minutes early and arrived into JFK 25 minutes early which impressed me a lot. Service provided by three polite smiling and delightful crew with drinks and snack run done fairly effortlessly and refills available and delivered with extra ice and a smile.

Jetblue Airways customer review,4,2014-08-28,"I'm writing about JetBlue's check-in operations at Fort Lauderdale airport. Apparently they have grown their operations there with insufficient and / or unmotivated staff. Trying to check in a bag for a recent flight to JFK took 45 minutes finally being called out of the line and being told ""you are too late"". All this while the lines got longer and their staff stood around chatting. Out of 13 desks 6 were open while I counted at least 9 JetBlue staff hanging around doing nothing except chat. Finally got to the gate only for their personnel there not having a clue about getting passengers onboard in a logical order. They need to up their game at FLL or this passenger will be using another carrier next time. On board service was good friendly and helpful which did mitigate some of the bad feeling about the FLL ground experience.",False,,,,,,4,2,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,False,
Jetblue Airways customer review,9,2014-08-28,I flew on flight 1731 from JFK to Bermuda. The flight was delayed so boarding started around 30 minutes late. Boarding was pretty chaotic as the PA system was not working properly. Onboard we were greeted by a friendly cabin supervisor who smiled and asked us how we were. Once seated the flight was airborne within 20 minutes an hour later than scheduled. Inflight service was efficient and friendly with drinks served individually from a tray rather than a trolley which was a nice touch with a free snack served from a basket. Landing cards were handed out - it would be great if they had a supply of pens. The flight then arrived around 30 minutes late into Bermuda disembarkment was quick - and I have to say I really enjoyed the flight.,False,,,,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,True,
Jetblue Airways customer review,10,2014-08-28,August 20 2014 flight 124. We flew from LAX to JFK on Mint. I can honestly say that I was very impressed! I have flown business class on many international airlines and the on-board service was comparable in every way. The food was excellent - best I have had on any airline. Flight attendants were friendly courteous and very attentive and our bags were the first to arrive at the carousel as promised. Furthermore the seats reclined to a flat position. All in all a great trip. The one suggestion for JetBlue is to have a small lounge area to accommodate Mint customers at larger airports such as LAX.,False,,,,,,4,5,,,5,,True,
Jetblue Airways customer review,1,2014-08-26,First time I've flown with JetBlue and very unimpressed. Plane over one hour late slow boarding slow off- boarding poor service waited ages for luggage.

Jetblue Airways customer review,1,2014-08-26,Aug 17 New York (JFK) to Orlando Intl (MCO) Flight 883. First time I've flown with JetBlue and it was not a pleasant experience. Told the flight delayed 15 minutes then another 15 minutes and so on. The plane was at the wrong terminal and took them over an hour to get it to the right gate! Boarding process was a farce very slow. 'Snack' was a packet of Doritos served by miserable cabin crew. De-boarding also very slow and then waited ages for our luggage. Only good points were that we got there in one piece and they have good leg room.,False,,,,,,4,2,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,False,
Jetblue Airways customer review,,2014-08-14,Flew from St. Maarten to JFK New York. An announcement came over the loud speaker asking if anyone wanted an upgrade. I mistakenly thought that meant an upgrade to first class. So I paid an extra $150 for my children and I to upgrade only to find out that I paid $150 for approximately a foot and a half extra leg room. I would have never spent my hard earned money on that and I believe that should've been explained to me. I will never fly jetBlue again.,False,,,,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,1,,False,

Jetblue Airways customer review,9,2014-07-29,Flew Mint class from LAX to JFK in July. Check in and boarding smooth and on time. Fantastic crew helpful and kind yet unobtrusive. Meal some of the best I've had inflight much better than BA and QR business long haul. Entertainment system not AVOD so whenever announcements were made I'd miss parts of the film I was watching. Good selection of entertainment though wifi never worked. Seat was the suite-style and very comfortable in all positions but surprisingly narrow in lie-flat.

Jetblue Airways customer review,,2014-07-22,Was flying for work from Tampa to DC and back. Good direct connection into Reagan at good prices so went for it. The flight to DC was uneventful and pleasant. A week later as I am returning I have checked in at DC and waiting at the gate when I get an email from my booking service provider 10 minutes before boarding time that my flight is cancelled. No announcements at the gate or anything. It just now has been changed from Tampa to Boston. 25 minutes later they announce to go to another gate to see attendants for help. After waiting nearly an hour to talk to the agents I am greeted by two very unhelpful or sympathetic agents. Our flight was cancelled because there was a mechanical failure on the plane scheduled for Boston so they used the Tampa plane instead. This information came from other customers in line who got it from their booking agents - not the Jetblue agents serving us. They tell me they can get me out two days later and if I want to get to Tampa the next day my best option is to cancel the return leg and book another flight with another airline as JetBlue doesn't have any partnerships. So I go ahead and do that. Book a flight for $300 with American for the next am and go to baggage drop area to collect my bag I had checked in earlier. There I was told I could get vouchers toward the hotel dinner etc. I collect my bag and am told by the agent there that since I cancelled my flight with JetBlue it is not in their hands any more and they can't compensate hotel etc. She did offer me a $12 voucher to use toward snacks at the airport. All in all this episode cost me an extra $400 (extra hotel cabs new ticket). I understand mechanical failures happen. I travel a lot all of the world. I was surprised how little these agents at the gate knew about how to handle people when their company is obviously letting them down. A dull blank emotionless stare and the customers had to suggest alternate satisfactory solutions. No proactive support.,False,,,,,,4,1,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,1,,False,
Jetblue Airways customer review,5,2014-07-20,I've flown Jetblue twice the first one was a good experience with no delays snacks beverages and nice crew. The second one was terrible: our flight JFK-FLL was at 6am and we got to the airport at 1am the screens showed that our flight was cancelled and we waited until 3.30am to receive any attention from JetBlue staff. They said that we would need to wait until tomorrow for another flight or we would need to go to LaGuardia Airport to take another flight in 2 hours offered no accommodation transportation to LGA or vouchers. We had to take a taxi from JFK to LGA. Fortunately we got our flight on time from LGA to FLL but we are really disappointed with this drawback. I think this is the last time we will fly Jetblue.,False,,,,,,4,2,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,False,
Jetblue Airways customer review,,2014-07-06,My son boarded a JetBlue flight in SF at 5.59am on July 2 bound for Portland ME connecting at JFK in NYC. The flight was diverted to Rochester N.Y where it sat for 8 hours. A JB agent in Rochester changed his connecting flight to Portland without checking to see if his connecting flight was on time (in fact it too was delayed). When he finally arrived at JFK at 11.30am he found that the new connecting flight on which he was re-routed had been cancelled. His original connecting flight however was the scheduled to depart JFK at 2.30 am. Ultimately his original connecting flight was also cancelled. The JB customer assistance desk was completely vacant and there were hour-long waits on the phone. A single gate agent was attempting to assist and her line was 100 feet long. When he reached her she said his only option was a flight leaving at 10.30 pm on July 3. He finally obtained a seat on a flight to Boston departing at 11 am. Eight hours later he walked past a gate at JFK that showed a flight to Portland at 1.30 pm which was never mentioned by the gate agent the previous night. He managed to get on the flight. All in all the worst nightmare air travel story I've ever heard. Never fly on JetBlue.,False,,,,,,,1,,,,,False,
Jetblue Airways customer review,10,2014-07-03,Flew JFK-ACK-JFK very easy check-in very comfortable Embraer 190 plane service on board was excellent both flights left on time.

Jetblue Airways customer review,7,2014-07-03,JFK-POS. Unfortunately Jetblue has lost its edge and is now very similar to the other U.S. carriers.
