"""The flight was a bargain""",8,2020-01-16,"London to Hanoi via Shenzhen. Boarding was a little prolonged and we were called to the gate much earlier than needed on the London - Shenzhen leg. Both of my flights left slightly late. The crew were friendly, seat was comfortable and food was surprisingly good considering. We had two full meals and drinks on the first leg, and a snack box on the second. The entertainment on the London - Shenzhen leg had enough options to satisfy me, though far fewer than other airlines. The system was modern and worked well. The Shenzhen - Hanoi leg had no entertainment. Crew announcements were hard to hear and very brief in English. Transiting in Shenzhen was as chaotic as expected, but took around an hour in total. I had to follow signs to domestic transfers, wait in a holding area to fill in some forms, through immigration, then headed upstairs to departures of my own volition.

"""required to have China Visa""",1,2019-05-29,"Singapore to Shenzen. Our booking this year for our annual trip to  destinations in Asia involved a return flight from Maldives to Singapore, Shenzen, and finally LA. The booking did NOT give us any indication that transfer via Shenzen will require an entry visa and complete customs process, immigration control and re-checking in. Shenzen Airlines food is lousy, weird Chinese option that my wife and I did not eat. Entertainment consisted of watching tiny ceiling mounted screens which require everyone to watch the same program which was Chinese material. Business Class seats were the same ones we get for a basic flight from LA say to San Francisco, except this is a five hour flight. Then there was the surprise upon arrival that we are required to have China Visa. We had been told our luggage would go directly to LA and there had been no mention of visa requirements. This involved about a dozen people. Other than the airline person who dumped us off at passport control, nobody spoke English: from the officer who got our passports and disappeared for about 25 minutes, to the immigration office who then stamped my passport and my wife's passport with the wrong sticker (visa is a sticker with name of holder and the name on it must match information on passport's photo page data. So the entire process had to be repeated. This also involved finger printing of all digits, email, US email address and phone number. Then we had to figure out mostly on our own how to get our luggage back, and take it to check in. After check in, we crawled our way to security check in which had a large line. They discovered via electronic transmission from check in area to security screening that there were batteries on our luggage and required us a stop by the inspection area. We had to wait for retrieval of our luggage and someone to inspect it, and that too took about half an hour. The few words they were able to tell us in response to my visible anger was - Sir, you have battery! Battery problem!  We dive, we have lighting gear for dives and photography that are too heavy to add to carry on. So they had us empty our luggage to inspect the batteries. By the time we went through a second screening, I was so livid I was yelling at everyone at security. When we were done, we had wasted our 3 hours layover. By then I was so heated and sweaty, the only thing I wanted was to get a shower before our 12 hour flight to LA. Get this I was able to do it because flight was delayed by a.5 hours!

"""caused me to lose tickets""",1,2019-05-11,"I bought return tickets London to Jakarta via Shenzhen. My trip from London to Jakarta in March was alright, yet I could not make it back. Shenzhen Airlines unprofessional gestures have caused me to lose the return flight. I tried to call and e-mail them to resolve the problem, but they never answered. It started with their flight cancellation on the 5th May from Jakarta to Shenzhen. After much hustles and hours waiting at the airport, the airline (through the Travel Agency) confirmed to transfer me with SC for Jakarta - Shenzhen flight on the 8th May, to continue with SA to London on the same day. I came to the airport in Jakarta on the 8th May for my flights, only for getting rejected to board by SC check-in crew because I don’t have Chinese transit visa, although I have valid UK Visa. I didn’t know that I needed it because according to my previous experience flying from London to Jakarta transferring in Shenzhen, the immigration could give me, Indonesian passport holder, a 24hr entry permit without problem. The officers threatened me that if I would’ve not been allowed to enter Shenzhen without visa by the Chinese immigration, I had to be repatriated and buy my own ticket back to Jakarta. In short, I missed the flight to Shenzhen for this. The next day I called the Chinese Embassy, they said that Indonesian passport holder may enter Shenzhen for 24hr free. I tried to call Shenzhen Airlines to confirm about the correct policy and ask about their procedure in this case, but they never answered my phone or e-mail. Shenzhen Airlines final words to me was given through travel agency, saying that they cancelled my flights for no show and couldn’t change or refund it. I think it was an unprofessional gesture from SA since it wasn’t my fault to miss the flight. They made a mistake by cancelling their own flights at first place, passed me to an airlines that demanded me a transit visa to fly with them, yet Shenzhen Airlines never instructed it clearly to me, or opened their communication line with the client in trouble.
