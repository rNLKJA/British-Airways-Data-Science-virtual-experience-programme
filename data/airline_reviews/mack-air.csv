"""give Mack Air a fine rating""",9,2019-04-15,"For an African bush airline, I have to hand it to Mack Air for having its act together, I arrived in Maun, Botswana from Cape Town and after clearing immigration, walked to the Mack Air desk, where I saw my name posted. The staff promptly and courteously took me in tow, gave me my boarding pass and took care of my luggage. Shortly thereafter, the staff escorted me to my plane, which was a very presentable Cessna Grand Caravan. The pilot and a few other passengers arrived and soon we were off to the air strip and safari lodge. The procedure was very much the same following the stay at the lodge when I flew on to Kasane, Botswana. The plane was spotless, the crew very good, and safety briefings were properly handled. And at Kasane, Mack Airâ€™s folks were on hand to see that I connected with my onward ground handler. As a pilot and as a former airline employee, I can honestly give Mack Air a fine rating. It is a good bush airline with all the trappings of larger carriers. I would fly with them anytime.",True,Cessna Grand Caravan,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Maun to Kasane via Okavango Delta,April 2019,4,3,,5,5,,True
