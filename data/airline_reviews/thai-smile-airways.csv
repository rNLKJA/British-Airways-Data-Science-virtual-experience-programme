The premium cabin with just 12 seats was in the usual Thai Airways colours. The seat pitch was an inch or so more than economy, and for an hours flight, it was fine. Before departure, a flight crew member took the meal order from each passenger, with a choice of two items - rice or noodles. On the outbound flight, I chose the chicken with rice, which came piping hot, so much so that the vegetables were in fact overcooked! On the return flight, it was noodles with shrimp.

This flight was operated by HS-TXK an aircraft that operated it's first flight on November 15, 2013. The aircraft is named 'Ranong', one of the southern provinces of Thailand on the west coast, along the Andaman Sea. Ranking is the least populous of all the provinces of Thailand. Check-in was a breeze and the counter staff was friendly and warm. Since I did not have any check-in luggage and had filled in my API earlier, the staff member took only a few seconds to print my boarding pass and I was able to proceed through security check and immigration immediately. Thai Smile does not offer lounge access, but for the price, this is hardly anything to complain about. At the gate, boarding was efficient, but this was hardly a full flight. Departure was ahead of schedule. The crew welcomed passengers on board with a warm Sawasdee Ka and were friendly and professional. They handed out Laos Immigration forms as passengers embarked. My only beef here with Thai Smile is that they insist you switch off all mobile devices for both landing and take-off. No 'flight mode' here. The seat is quite comfortable for a short haul flight and unlike most low cost carriers offered me the option to stretch a bit. The seat pocket had a Thai Smile magazine and a promotional magazine of ""One Tambon One Product"", an initiative by the Royal Thai Government to promote the skills of indigenous craftspeople. The aircraft was clean and bright with the gorgeous colour of the seats. Since this was the first flight of the aircraft for the day, I think it had had a thorough scrub down before the flight. I did not get to use the on-board washroom. In spite of being a low cost carrier, Thai Smile offers a hot snack even on the short 1 hour flight to Laos. The meal arrives in environment friendly boxes, proudly proclaiming, ""Thai Smile Saves The World"". I wish they'd do away with the plastic cutlery though and use bio-degradable options. On this flight, they served an excellent hot Cheese Pizza bar, with a packaged orange juice and a serve of three slices of fruits, a glass of water was also served. The meal box also had a refreshing towel in it. The crew made rounds with tea and coffee. No headphones were provided on this flight and I wasn't able to locate any headphone jacks on my seat. Entertainment was screened on overhead screens and featured episodes of Laughs for Gags, which is ideal when you have no headphones. Arrival into Wattay International was on-time and the cockpit crew should be complimented for what was one of the smoothest landing I have experienced. The cabin-crew offered a warm farewell. Included in price of the ticket was 20kg of luggage, a hot meal, free seat selection and I earned 500 miles, the same that I would earn on a Thai Airways economy class flight.

"""didn’t like the food on board""",8,2019-01-25,"Generally, I prefer to fly on Thai Airways within Thailand, this is due to the fact that they use larger aircraft (widebodies) even on domestic routes. I flew Thai Airways up to Chiang Mai, but due to schedule requirements I needed the first flight to Bangkok so I chose Thai Smile who are fully owned by Thai Airways, but operated with a different style. At check in, there was no exact sign showing where to check in if you’re star alliance gold, but they still checked me in using the business class counter, and very kindly gave me a full row to myself. The lounge opens at 5 am and the flight departs at 6:15. I arrived at 4:50am and was told to wait near the reception (inside the lounge) by a janitor and a receptionist arrived and took my gold card and boarding pass. Do note that only Thai Airways’ own elites have lounge access, as Thai Smile is a Star Alliance Affiliate, not full member. I was first to board the aircraft after people needing wheelchairs, and was directed to my seat. The flight was 80% full although as promised they gave me an entire row. The seat itself is identical to BA on their short haul fleet, except for the fact that the backrest is fabric and not leather. It’s comfortable enough and much better than most slimline seats. Service on this flight consisted of something very weird, one sandwich was full of meat and no vegetables, whereas the other one was mixed veg with mayonnaise. I didn’t like the food on board, but I already ate in the lounge. I definitely feel sorry for the 120+ other passengers on the flight. They do come around with a drinks cart, and I asked for Coke Zero and they gave me a can, whereas they normally just pour it from a large bottle. One thing Thai Smile does well is the packaging in which the food comes in, it’s very chic and practical after the flight, appealing to millennials. I find that the flight attendants on Thai Smile are in the beginning of their careers and the airline itself is very age-selective, so the crew may not be as experienced as Thai Airways or other companies. Nevertheless they will absolutely serve you with a “Thai Smile” pun intended. With a smooth arrival and an actual gate (normally they use air stairs) it was gate to kerb in 10 minutes including a bathroom break.

So, I took my luggage into the cabin on the long haul flight to avoid the immigration procedures at BKK airport for collection and checkin of my luggage again at Bangkok Airport. After my arrival in Bangkok I found out that Thai Smile Airways has got no Transfer counter. Worse than that, its mother company Thai Airways also rejected to issue me a boarding pass, even though, the ticket was bought from Thai Airways. This ment I had to clear immigration and customs in Bangkok, approach the Thai Smile (better Thai Cry) checkin counter, queue up for 30 minutes, get the boarding pass, do security check again, go through immigration again which took altogether one and a half hours. Luckily I had three hours connection time, so I finally made it to my flight to Yangon. No Star Alliance benefits, even though I had a Ticket bought from Thai Airways.

After my experience, I can say Thai Smile is an excellent choice for the regional flights in Thailand.",False,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,BKK to KBV,December 2015,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",4,4,,True,
"""good service onboard""",10,2015-12-03,"Very good service onboard from very nice Thai Smile Airways FA's. Shortly after take off on this short 50 minute flight was served a free snack and water, coffee and orange juice. Aircraft was very clean and new, only a 50% load factor so had 3 seats to stretch out. Definitely would recommend this airline for the cheap fares - it only cost me approx GBP33.",False,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,BKK to UTH,November 2015,5,5,,5,5,,True,
Thai Smile Airways customer review,7,2015-08-26,"The ground staff at Chiang Mai Airport was polite and managed the check in procedure quickly and without any hassles. Boarding the aircraft you were greeted by the flight attendants with a smile, who were helpful and did their job in a polite and professional way. The flight itself was on time and uneventful. Shortly after take off you were served a snack and water. The aircraft was tidy and clean with standard seat configuration (3-3). The seats were a little bit cramped due to a quite narrow seat pitch but for a short flight (about 55 minutes) it was yet sufficient. In fact there was nothing to complain about the flight itself. In my opinion you get value for money as the (mostly reasonable) ticket price is all inclusive. Which means you get a free 20 kg baggage allowance, free seat selection, a free snack and beverage as mentioned above and also don't even get charged extra when paying by credit card. And this is a bliss compared to other so called budget airlines in the region which tend to be very inventive and eager to squeeze the unwary passenger as much as possible by creating various extra fees. Nevertheles near the end of Thai Smile's Internet booking procedure you should check if you really need a travel insurance that seems to be added automatically but can be deselected without problem. But apart from that you are not confronted with extra charges. Last but not least it is also worth mentioning that Thai Smile operates the majority of its flight to/from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport which offers far better transport options onward to the city (and other destinations) than Bangkok Don Muang Airport. If you plan to travel inside Thailand you should consider giving Thai Smile a try.",False,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chiang Mai to Bangkok,July 2015,2,3,,3,4,,True,
