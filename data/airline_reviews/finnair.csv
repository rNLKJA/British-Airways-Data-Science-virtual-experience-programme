"""our transit time was too short""",1,2022-09-08,"Paris to Penang via Helsinki and Singapore. I thought Finnair was a great airline which offers awesome blueberry juice, but it turns out to be an illusion. I had travelled with my partner from Paris to Penang, Malaysia with transits at Helsinki and Singapore (final transit was operated by Jetstar). Our nightmare began as we did not receive all of our boarding pass at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. The staff at the check-in counter did not provide us the boarding pass for the last flight from Singapore to Penang, without explaining further to us what was the problem and just told us to “look out” for help when we reached Singapore Changi Airport. Unfortunately, we had a delay at Helsinki Airport (they waited for some passengers) and the flight reached Singapore with about 30 minutes delay. We were worried about our transit at Singapore, as the stated transit duration was 55 minutes, while the actual time left was less than 25 minutes. We quickly rushed to the boarding gate (without our boarding pass, and we couldn’t find the transfer counter while manoeuvring ourselves through the packed Changi Airport). Well, the security denied our entry to the gate, and said that we were not in the passenger list on the flight. Exhausted after sprinting to the gate, we couldn’t do anything but to see our plane leaving the gate and departing without us. We referred to the transfer counter soon after, and they told us that our transit time was too short, and it was impossible for us to board our next flight. Jetstar personnel at the transfer counter arranged for us another flight in the late evening the next day, with a free entry to a lounge. Apparently, the lounge only offered us dinner and we did not have any accommodation for that night as the hotel was fully booked, thanks Finnair. On the bright side, we were given the opportunity to explore Changi airport for 24 hours, a whole day for us to rot there. As our compensation, Finnair did not check through all of our baggage for the replacement flight back to Penang. The personnel at Penang airport helped us to make a report on our lost baggage on arrival, and we finally got them back five days later. Finnair/Jetstar only made the effort to look for our luggage on the day we called to JetStar's office, and urged them to handle the incident responsibly. Finnair/Jetstar, please make sure that your transit schedule is arranged logically and with more consideration towards travellers, and if there’s any delay, please provide us with assistance to move between the gates.

Finally when I made it to the gate the flight had been delayed because Finnair did the same to other flights yet the app and website never updated. Finnair made several of us think we had missed our flight! Then when I got to the gate, the staff checked all of my documents again even though I had been checked in Finland less than 2 hrs before. They made me the last to board. Messy online presence. Too many emails saying the same thing but hard to find relevant information (for example, I couldn't find any information about the trip from Stockholm to LAX). More than half of their desks are empty, so very hard to find any human help. Additionally, I submitted an online complaint and their answer was less than helpful. They really don't care about customer service! See answer in photo below. Luggage information in Helsinki was never clear and caused us to step out and have to ring the doorbell to get our bags.

"""airline removing customer service""",2,2021-11-28,"Another airline removing customer service. On a business trip to St. Petersburg, Russia for a week, decided to pay a little extra for flexible tickets in case I would finish up early - and I did. Go to the Finnair site a few days ahead of return tip, select an earlier flight and get told the fee for the new ticket would be 0 - excellent. When confirming the change a generic error message comes up, and the site does not allow me to do anything further. I immediately try contacting their customer chat but after navigating the chatbot menus for a few minutes it puts me in line for an operator then immediately hangs up because the volume of requests is too high. The next day I log on to their site again, and this time my new flight shows up under the booking - great! I then reasonably assume the change went through as planned, and that the error only came at a later step in the process. A few more days of my trip pass until it's time to check-in, and only when trying to do so does another error message appear telling me I can't check-in and to contact Finnair specifically at a number in Finland. Obviously calling an overseas customer service number is pretty annoying with queues and all, but I do so and spend 30 minutes waiting to no avail - no queue number is given, only that they are currently receiving an exceptional number of requests. At this point I am running out of time but feel my best bet at actually getting service will be at the airport counter itself, so I make sure to arrive there with an hour extra to spare. There is no Finnair staff at the airport, but the local Russian ground staff are very helpful - basically explaining that the system says I need to pay a EUR100 fee to complete the rebooking. This was not the info I was given on the Finnair site when requesting the rebook, and does not make sense with my ticket category having free rescheduling, but after spending 90 minutes at the airport trying to sort this out - with both ground staff and myself trying to reach Finnair - I relent and pay the extra fee instead of missing my flight entirely. I obviously know it will be a nightmare to reclaim this from the airline later, but I swear to at least try. On my return flight I have a connection in Helsinki, Finnair's home airport, so here I figure at least I can talk to their staff in person and get a little more clarity. I don't have time to leave the security area and seek out the ticketing office, but I track down two of Finnair's transfer desks at least, but they are both unmanned! Since returning home last night I have tried their chat twice more, again I get disconnected immediately because the volume of requests is too high. I obviously cannot find an email address to contact them at, and I simply don't have the patience to be in a phone queue for hours. So in sum - multiple individuals (me, my wife, airport ground staff) have tried to reach Finnair through multiple means (phone, chat, in-person at home airport) without any luck - all to understand why their website has failed to rebook my flight at the listed price, then not informed about the issue they created either so I could address it prior to actually traveling.

The bag was photographed and reported immediately at the arrival destination airport. Under International rules the last carrier is responsible for  damage to luggage so I put in a claim to Finnair. It took Finnair nearly six weeks to even respond to my baggage claim after multiple attempts by me and my travel agent (emails and Phone calls). They demanded the bag be inspected by an accredited baggage representative before they would even make a decision (at a cost to me of $60 which they refused to cover). It was deemed irreparable and unusable for luggage. The decision was made to replace the bag. This was eventually handed over to a Czech Baggage company called DOLFI 1920 - (what a dysfunctional company). Even though they are a re-seller of the bag that was damaged they refused to supply the same hard shell bag. They decided I was to receive a Samsonite soft bag worth 2/3 of my new bag. They claimed to have despatched the replacement bag, but tracking scanning shows it leaving Czech and never to be seen again. Months later it has not arrived in Australia and is not held up here in customs. The Postal Service has told me that after this length of time that the bag is lost and Dolfi should raise a lost bag claim. I have rung Dolfi1920 - they refuse to do this.

In both instances, I had to stay in Helsinki overnight (a hotel room in the vicinity of HEL Airport was provided ), but when the question of compensation according to EU-legislation came up, Finnair continues to do everything possible to avoid payment. My flight from Tallin to HEL in August 2018 was due on a Friday at noon, which would have made it possible to catch the onward flight to VIE on Friday evening. In Tallinn, aproximately 24 hours before departure (Thursday at around 1 p.m.), I received a phone call from Finnair customer service, telling me that my flight the next day was cancelled, no reasons mentioned. The only solution was to book me on next day's evening flight from Tallinn to HEL, which meant that I would miss the connecting flight and would have to spend the night at a hotel at the airport.  I claimed the compensation due according European regulations (EUR 250 in this case). Finnair declined to pay the compensation because the flight was allegedly cancelled due to ""extraordinary reasons"". The extraordinary reasons, I was told, were ""unexpected heavy traffic"" at HEL airport and construction works on the runway. Yet, construction work is legally never considered an ""extraordinary condition"" as it is foreseeable; and due to the fact that flight was cancelled the day before, ""unexpected high level of traffic"" (on the next day) is impossible for obvious logical reasons.

My latest experience with Finnair had some unforseen turns which the airline mastered to my full satisfaction. I had booked a trip with only 50 minutes of transfer time between the two flights - since it was at Finnair's home base Helsinki, I assumed things would be managed according to plan. However, the first flight started with about 45 minutes of delay which made the transfer impossible. What impressed me is how the situation was handled upon arriving at Helsinki. Immediately when arriving to the airport building, we were greeted by four Finnair representatives and a table with the new connecting flights for all those passengers who had missed their original flights due to the delay. I was handed my new flight (and a small food voucher) but wasn't happy with the details and preferred a different flight on the same day. I was advised to try getting on that flight at the transfer desk which I easily found thanks to the helpful instructions by the other representatives. The lady at the transfer desk was just as helpful and got me the last seat on my preferred flight. Also, I received a second quite generous food voucher due to the increased waiting time for the new flight. With a total of 25€ from food vouchers I could bridge the waiting time well and have a very good lunch, even at Finnish prices. Getting on my new connecting flight worked without a problem and my baggage was delivered as planned too - even though the second flight was from another airline than Finnair. Altogether, this trip was a flawless display on how a missed connection due to delay should be handled by an airline. Situations like a delayed flight can occur and taking appropriate action in these unforseen situations tells a lot about an airline. For Finnair, it told much good.

This is my story of how Finnair forced my young daughter to sit by her self. It concerns flight AY101 on December 14th. Traveling from Stockholm to Bangkok through Helsinki and Hong Kong, I started check in 24 h before the first flight. For the first leg I could choose seats (within economy) for free. Seats with extra leg room - which had an additional fee - were marked with a $ sign. Doing the same procedure for HEL-HKG, I moved us from economy seats in the middle to 3 seats by the window. No $ sign on the new seats. A message that changing seats may result in a fee was shown. When finalizing my check in I'm shown a bill for about €70. As I did not want to pay that, I try to change back to our default seats, but am unable to do that - even though I try many times and google for solutions. I give up and decides to try to get things sorted checking in at the airport. At the airport they are only able to give us separate seats on the flight and asks us to try to change that at Helsinki airport. At Helsinki I try again, but am told they can't do that as the flight is full. At boarding I ask the staff to ask if any other passenger would be willing to switch seat, but no, they can not do that. They do can offer us Business Class seats - for € 500 per person. So their defective check in system and their staffs unwillingness/inability to solve a problem - which I did not cause - results in that my young daughter, who is anxious about flying, is forced to sit by herself. Really bad! Except for the above mentioned I have no major complaints - but if I can not trust an airline to keep my family together, I won't use them.",True,A320 / A350-900,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Stockholm to Hong Kong via Helsinki,December 2018,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",1,3,,2,False

Upon boarding in Helsinki, I was offered a choice of blueberry juice, champagne or water. The seat on the A350 was the 1-2-1 business class found on many other airlines. However, I felt more cramped as Qatar Airways has 6 rows in it's forward cabin whereas Finnair has 8 rows in it's forward cabin. The seat in bed mode was comfortable and adequate for sleeping.

My preordered ox cheek, enjoyed with a glass of pinot noir (Unusually served in a flat glass) was excellent, although I would've preferred the food to be served in a plate instead of a bowl.

When I arrived in Shanghai (PVG) however, Finnair started showing their true colours. I had a connecting flight with Philippine Airlines to Manila. Due to a delay from HEL, we were several passengers who had to hurry to the next flight. We were guided by a Finnair rep through immigration, and were told to not pick up and re-check our luggage, as there were no time. (This, of course, saved Finnair from paying compensation for delayed arrival) I was told that Finnair would take care of my luggage, and get it to my hotel. This turned out to be a gigantic exaggeration. Well in place at my first hotel in the Philippines, I got an e-mail in partly understandable english from PVG, asking for where to send my luggage. After some mailing, it was clear that my luggage would NOT be delivered to my hotel, as a real airline would have done. After two days, I had to travel for 2 hours to the nearest airport to pick it up. Well there I got one of my two pieces of luggage. The airport crew could not find any more information about my second piece of luggage. Figuring it may come with the next flight from Manila, I waited for 4 hours. Finally, I got an e-mail from my partly illiterate contact at PVG, informing me that my other piece of luggage was delayed due to customs. To make it short, Finnair Customer ""service"" could/would not help, my contact at PVG stopped answering my mails, and I had no clue about my luggage.

"""Not worth the stress""",3,2018-02-15,"Finnair is really 2 airlines. The first is the international glossy one which I flew from NY to Helsinki. Helsinki airport is really nice. Then there is the old Stalin style Finnair. It is horrible, horrible, horrible. Flying Helsinki to St. Petersburg, Russia was a nightmare. They use a 'Nordic Alliance"" old turbo prop plane which has teeny tiny overhead cabins. In the freezing winter, in terrible weather they bus you onto the tarmac and you wait in line to board. I saw mothers with newborns worrying out that their baby had to be exposed without proper bundling to the elements, and I really sympathized. The staff on the local routes are nasty and crude. The food is non-existent. However, the absolute worst part is the strange standards they apply when trying to leave St. Petersburg. I flew out with the same luggage I flew in with. No difference. However, the standards at check in in St. Petersburg only allow for 8kg of carry on luggage. This is for an international flight. I did not have this problem in NY, nor Helsinki to St. Petersburg. Then the overhead luggage for the turboprop plane is not international standards. I take the same piece of carry on with me all over the world - no problem. The overhead bins for the turboprop were miniscule. I had to take my bag apart, put it in checked luggage, and then pay $88 USD for the privilege of being overweight 2kg because I was forced to put my carry on into my checked luggage. So - NY to Helsinki - luggage fine Helsinki to St. Petersburg - luggage fine St. Petersburg to Helsinki - luggage not fine Helsinki to NY - out of my hands. Then at the gate I saw a woman who had a backpack, and it was a little tall. They refused to let her board the turboprop plane with it and she missed her flight. Finnair is ok on an international direct flight. If you have to change planes or syphon off to one of their local routes its a disaster. Not worth the stress, service or anything else.

As a start, the online check in gave me and my wife seats in different rows saying there was no adjecent seat available, 3 minutes after online check in started (24h prior to departure). So I contacted Finnair online service, who said that they was so sorry but the plane was full. However, she recomended that we buy an upgrade to Economy Comfort. Then we both could sit together and have more legroom. Nice try. We tried once more at the check in/bag drop counter. But the Finnair staff at JFK didnt even bother to check if there was any possibility to change seats. Instead he turned and wanted to weigh our carry-ons. The bags weighed between 9-11 kg and he then prompted that Finnair rules was max 8 kg. We flew out with AA/BA who had 23 kg carry-on allowance wich we pointed out. He just laughed at us and said that no one allows 23 kg since that would be dangerous. So my wife had to repack our bags at the counter, for 3kg overweght. When I asked fo speak with a manager, another check in staff entered obviously playing manager and just said that this was a Finnair flight with Finnair rules. Then they all laughed and bid us a nice day. By the way, when my wife had unpacked and take out her camera from bag we were forced to check in, the man behind the counter turned again. - ""Oh, it was a camera in the carry on?

The answer time for an email is 2-4 weeks, but 3 weeks have gone now and no answer yet. Just an errand number that I can use to file more complaints.

"""service way below standards""",2,2018-01-01,"Miami to Vienna via Helsinki in February 20917. MIA-HEL in on an A330-300 (wet leased from IB) connecting to HEL-VIE on an A320 (which this time was actually operated by AY). In MIA, AY uses the F-gates - which means if you are arriving from a connecting Oneworld flight (e.g. AA), you have to get completely out of the secure area, walk through terminals D and E to get to terminal F and go through security again (TSA was friendly and fast). In addition, AY uses pay per entry Club America as its lounge, which is a depressing and dismal facility, e.g. bar closes at 9 pm (i.e. two hours before scheduled departure), food nonexistent - the poorest lounge for an intercontinental flight I have encountered for a while, even the domestic AAdmirals Club at DFW was better. The lounge closed at 9.30 pm, again scheduled (!) departure time of the flight was 10.55 pm. Really, what is AY thinking. Also no separate WIFI access and the generic airport WIFI was not working, either. Later, when it worked it was limited to 30 minutes. Whole experience at MIA was not worthy of a Oneworld carrier. When boarding, AY did not accept boarding passes issued by AA, you had to exchange them for ones issued by AY. This again was a first time leading to additional time to be spent in line to have them exchanged. While U.S. based carriers never accept boarding passes issued by a foreign carrier, European airlines normally do. So much for seamless Oneworld integration. Finally, boarded an A-330-300 which was wet leased from IB (now this makes 5 out of the last 6 flights I booked with AY that were sold to me as a flight to be operated by AY, but later outsourced to another company). However, IB is at least a decent airline; three of the flights were outsourced to low cost carriers. Seats were lie-flat a 1-2-1 configuration; good and comfortable. Onboard, service was way below standards. No wine card available. The white wines offered was a French one, which I (or the cabin crew) was not familiar with and an unusual choice of a Riesling from New Zealand, which turned out be actually decent. Even basics such as sparkling water were not available. The cod from the menu turned out to be a much too dry piece of salmon; with a starter was that was salmon as well. The meal was just about edible, but far from being good and nowhere comparable to the meal out of HEL. IB FA's were attentive but limited by what AY gave them to work with. Early arrival in HEL and disembarkation by bus (no gate position). This did not happen to me, that an intercontinental flight did not have a gate arrival at a major airport, since i stopped flying via FRA, where this happens quite regularly. During the flight I talked to the single AY flight attendant on board and she told me that the reason for all this outsourcing was a severe and structural shortage of pilots to cover the scheduled routes, so this situation will likely continue. AY even used dismal Hi-Fly on some North American routes. I am sorry to say this, as AY was for long one of my favorite choices for travel to Asia and the Nordics, but they seem to have completely lost it. I do not think I will use them for a while. Maybe things will eventually better again. Definitely avoid the MIA route. Otherwise, transfer in HEL was easy and fast and AY's Schengen lounge was tremendously busy, but with good food offerings (e.g. tasty Finnish game stew) and decent wine.

"""mostly ups, a few downs""",7,2017-10-15,"✅ Verified Review | I didn't even plan on flying with Finnair, it was destiny who put me on this flight. Or rather, it was a spontaneous cancellation of my actual flight which I had with KLM - one day before departure. But this review is about Finnair, that other story will be told another day. So I got put on the Finnair route from Berlin Tegel via Helsinki Vantaa to Kansai International at 2.30am in the morning, about 11 hours before departure. I woke up with this new flight on my phone and thought to myself ""Sure, why not? Finnair is supposed to be pretty nice"". The trip from Tegel to Helsinki was nice, but nothing spectacular. A typical intra-european flight on a better-than-budget airline. Okay legroom, drink and a snack on a 2-hour-flight - the typical treatment for Economy Class. In Helsinki, I had a 90-minute-layover which will become important again later in the story. At that time, everything was fine though. Nice airport and more than enough time for me to transfer to the intercontinental flight to Kansai International. The plane on the long haul fight appeared very modern and very clean. The crew was very courteous and left no wishes open (economy class wishes, that is). The legroom was one of the few things that left some room for improvement (more than for legs) - on a very similar-distance flight with Lufthansa it was designed more generously. The entertainment offer included several recent movies as well as a number of more classic ones - less than on other intercontinental flights with different carriers but quite enough for the 10 hours of the trip. I never quite got all the run-down jokes on airplane food - most of the times I had it it was pretty decent, even very tasty on several occasions (esp. when flying with Korean carriers). Finnair made me understand the humour behind it to a degree. Out of two meal choices, only one was left when I was served - the macaroni casserole. It was dry, unseasoned and rater disappointing. Maybe that's why the other meal option ran out so fast. Sitting in the back of the plane, I had no choice but to swallow what was left. In fairness, the other components of the meal and the breakfast meal were tasty! The flight itself was very smooth and when putting everything together, I had an experience on the plane that I am definitely keen on repeating. When leaving the plane at Kansai International, I thought for a moment that I am the lucky recipient of special VIP treatment. An information board with my name on it greeted me right after entering the airport building. Unfortunately, the only thing it said was ""Please refer to the baggage desk for further information"". This is where the 90-minute-layover from Helsinki comes back into the story. While 90 minutes is enough time for a human to transfer from one plane to the other, baggage sometimes is not as quick. This was the case, as the lady at the counter informed me. I was left without clothes, electronics and cosmetics on the first day of my trip. Also, I hadn't slept for about 22 hours. However, the bureaucratic process of sending my baggage straight to the hotel went smooth and fast and Japanese efficiency showed its beautiful face. One day later, my backpack was delivered to the hotel. The refunding process for the clothes and cosmetics that I bought as replacements went fast and without problems. To sum up, my experience with Finnair had mostly ups and a few downs. Looking back, I wouldn't hesitate to travel with them again.

I am very happy to hear that Finnair is beginning to introduce the new A350 on their Japan routes as the A340 I was on was an awful experience. The food was just ok - not much money spent. I ate it but not with much pleasure. On flight back from Japan it was markedly better as it must come from a Japanese kitchen. I fly Finnair short haul once a month and they are efficient even if they completely ignore your preferred seat as a Finnair Plus member and always seat me in an aisle seat even though my saved preference is a window seat. I don't feel they pay much attention to your frequent flyer status.

"""I am happy with the flight""",7,2017-06-27,"✅ Verified Review |  This was my return flight to Singapore where I am working at present. This is also my second return journey with Finnair. I must say that overall, I am happy with the flight. I have been making these long haul trips roughly twice each year for the last 30 years so I think I can draw comparisons with other airlines. Sadly, I have never been able to afford business class or higher as I have always been on a teacher's budget! First of all, the negatives; Food - depending on the sector, this can range from average to poor. Surprisingly, what is offered on the Helsinki out bound flights tends to be poor with rather unappetising fare. I chose low sodium as a welcome option at check in but it seemed a pretty uninspired attempt. Flavour is not just obtained through salt so I felt that very little effort had been made here. Entertainment- for economy class, this is quite limited. I think the choice of movies was pretty poor and the TV series offered were fairly predictable. By the time I had made my second flight, I was seriously running low on choice. Comfort - no huge complaints here as I had great leg room thanks to the option of a seating upgrade (extra charges at booking stage). but I travelled with my son on the final leg of the journey and although we were allocated 'extra leg room' seats, he did not get the same easy access that I did even though the upgrade charge was the same forboth seats. I would recommend that you double check the seating plan aswhen we checked online before travelling the seating layout shown wasnot the same as the one in the plane itself. The positives; I have to say that I am now a fan on of the A350 (I first tried it on Qatar airways) and it is a better travel experience. Each time I have travelled on this plane (mostly on 12-13 hour flights) I have felt much fresher and less haggard than previously. General comfort and service - the short sector from Heathrow to Helsinki is rather like a budget experience and you have to pay for snacks rather like Ryan Air but the service on every sector was pretty impressive. We had a largely Asian cabin crew on our last flight and they were really attentive but this doesn't mean that the Finnish staff are lacking. In fact, the whole attitude to customer service is kindly and professional. I noted that a couple of passengers had some trouble with the entertainment system (something I have had particularly unpleasant experience of on BA in particular) but even during the service period, staff took note and reset the system as promised. This is really commendable as often I have had cabin crew making promises that they blissfully 'forget' moments later. One really nice touch for passengers with the increased legroom is that they get the bonus of noise-cancelling headphones. These are proper effective headphones and really do what they promise. Overall, the experience was good. I think I will pack some tasty snacks next time and just have a drink as the meals were a real low point for me.",False,A350,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Singapore via Helsinki,June 2017,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",4,4,,3,True

"""the seating area was dirty""",2,2017-06-23,"✅ Verified Review |  Have flown to Bangkok at least 70 times and sorry to say that this was the worst experience ever, as it was irritating start to finish. The business class lounge was full up, with crowds waiting outside to gain entry. Surely, the airline should know roughly how many business and first class passengers are likely to use the lounge at any given time based on experience of their schedules, and then restrict entry to those with the applicable tickets, and not the readily available memberships that you can purchase, as these memberships do state that at busy times entry could be restricted. After 20 minutes I was allowed in, but really there was no point as there was nowhere to sit. Ended up eating some food standing up by one of the serving tables. Not an ideal way to start a long distance flight. Once on board, I found the A380 to be light and airy, pretty much the same as most A380's, although the seating area was dirty, with bits of dried food on the seat, on the pull down table and on the floor. Maybe cleaners had an off day. I had especially booked one of the window seats, which is a window seat, as I like a little privacy, and not on the two centre seats that are next to each other. You pay your money, you are entitled to do this, if the seat is available. As we were waiting for take off, a married couple took the seats to my immediate right, in the centre. The wife, who was directly opposite me, stated complaining really loudly and obnoxiously and was basically upset because she felt that because the way the seats were laid out and she couldn't actually see her husband, and that he wouldn't be able to hear her when she spoke (shouted)! I am sure the whole plane could hear her. She kept looking at me and it was obvious that she wanted me to swap seats with her husband, so he and she could be next to each other with the aisle separating them. She called the stewardess over, started talking and then the next thing you know, the stewardess is next to me trying to be nice with small talk. She starts to say that she has a small problem and I tell her that I am guessing she is asking if I would be prepared to swap seats with the people adjacent to me. Because I had taken the time to research the seats and pre-booked my seat especially, I did not want to change. The stewardess should have recognised this and respected this. Unfortunately, because I had refused she was very cold towards me and the lady passenger who was upset was starring at me throughout the flight, deliberately making faces, deliberately banging the overhead locker aggressively and on the whole making my whole flight uncomfortable. I felt guilty, even though I should not have done so, and my main gripe is that Finnair should not have contributed to my intimidation by this passenger. Food was reasonable, seat comfort average, quality of the business class seat very average, compared to other business class seats I have flown on. My return flight experience was even worse, and I will post a review very shortly.

"""a rather disappointing experience""",3,2017-06-23,"✅ Verified Review |  
Booked three AY flights but ended up flying not a single AY plane. Vienna - Helsinki - Kemi-Tornio and Helsinki - Vienna in Economy last July. At the time of booking all three segments were to be operated by Finnair jets. Since then obvious cost cutting measures have set in and the domestic HEL-KEM segment was outsourced to Norra, which operated an old and tatty ATR-72 turboprob on this 90 minute segment, while the VIE-HEL and HEL-VIE segments were now operated by LCC carrier Air Berlin (with a Finnish cabin crew). It was the first time I flew (or actually did not) Finnair since they changed to a low cost service model. Everything is extra (checked luggage is extra, reserving even a middle seat at the back incurs extra charges, booking directly with them on their website incurs an extra service fee and snacks and drinks are for a charge). However water, coffee, tea and blueberry juice are still complimentary. While the Air Berlin segments proved to be quite comfortable, as we were able to secure Comfort seats with better legroom at the front of the plane by checking in very early (and AY did not charge extra for these seats), the ATR-72 is very uncomfortable plane even for 90 minute flight with narrow seats. I normally try to avoid this type of planes. However legroom was good as well. Cabin crew was always professional but on the VIE-HEL segment not very interested and doing only the absolute minimum required (only one drink service on this 2 ½ hour flight and the “mandatory” in flight sales). Crew on the return flight was much better and active, doing two drink services and one water run while we waited for our delayed departure. Web check-in worked fine and Bag Drop in VIE was fast and friendly. However, no priority boarding was offered other than the initial Business Class only call. Situation for the return flight in HEL was completely different. Check-in was chaotic with the whole departure hall buzzing with hundreds of people waiting in various long lines or looking for the appropriate counter, also long lines for priority. Although very busy, only one of three priority counters dedicated to both Oneworld Sapphire and Ruby was open leading to very slow progress. However, a lot of AY personnel could be seen standing in the hall or chatting among themselves. So, obviously rather an organizational approach than a case of not enough agents available. Also, if you are not priority, everything is strictly self-service, including tagging your luggage. Surprisingly, security was very fast and efficient, so it seemed to be strictly an AY issue. Also, delays. VIE-HEL was on-time, while HEL-KEM was delayed 30 minutes. HEL-VIE boarded as scheduled, but then incurred a delay of 20 minutes due to incomplete paperwork and thus missed its slot which finally resulted in a 50 minute arrival delay. In addition, it took a further 30 minutes for the luggage to arrive at the belt with priority bags definitely not coming out first. Overall not a dismal, but a rather disappointing experience. Low cost service approach in the air and on the ground does not mix well with high AY fares. If I wanted to fly Air Berlin, I would have booked Air Berlin not AY. If wanted to fly in uncomfortable ATR turboprops, I would not have booked a Finnair jet service. I used to really like AY, but this experience was simply not good. Also, there seems to be high chance that you will actually not fly AY, even if you book an AY-operated flight.",False,A320 / ATR-72,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vienna to Kemi-Tornio via Helsinki,July 2016,3,4,,2,2,,,False
"""seat you get makes a big difference""",6,2017-06-17,"Flew Bangkok to Helsinki with Finnair. It's a budget airline, but a good one for long-haul. I didn’t realise it used a budget model, not even after I was asked to pay to select a seat. This means that you likely get the worst middle seat if you don’t pay, but it meant I was able to lock in good economy seats for a bit more. The first seat I chose was great but on the return flight I chose 41C, which had a high price due to being an exit row - legroom was no problem but it was right outside the toilets, with lots of light and noise, and a kink in the aisle led to people banging into me as I passed, so it was a terrible seat for sleeping. Even with the wonderful A350 on their Asia flights, the exact seat you get makes a big difference to comfort. Other budget elements include poorly-trained and slow check-in staff at Bangkok (although in Europe they were great), using airport gates that are too small for the aircraft, a very long speech at the beginning about all the services that they want to sell you - very informative but including the Finnish version, it must have gone for 20 minutes and you couldn’t access entertainment until it was finished, mediocre (but free) meals, and giving you a couple of free alcoholic drinks with the first meal but you have to pay after that. There was also a very limited movie selection but at least you can plug in a USB.

Most passengers on the flight seemed to be transferring from flights from Asia. The lounge in Helsinki (non - schengen area) has a sauna and shower area. Bit odd as it is unisex but I had the whole place to myself (after 6pm it is quiet). Fairly good range of food, drinks etc in the nearly empty lounge. Of particular interest was the finnish bread. It took a while for the plane to load and get airborne but once we did the service was good. Newspapers offered. Two different types of champagne. Good meal, salmon, bread, veg, berry pie for desert. Flight attendants very friendly and attentive, more drinks freely available. V nice Ittala glasses and cutlery. I think the economy seats are a non issue on a short flight like this because the middle seat is kept free, therefore you can work etc in privacy and have a bit more legroom. I understand that this is the norm on European business class flights. I really enjoyed my experience flying Finnair business class which was significantly better than economy class or a low cost airline. In my own view, it makes flying something to look forward to.

"""the worst flight experience""",1,2017-02-10,"✅ Verified Review |  I had the worst flight experience with Finnair. I bought a Finnair round trip ticket from Madrid to Kansai via Helsinki  although it was $300+ more expensive than their competitors on StudentUniverse, because they had shorter flight time (15 hours with one transit in Helsinki) and I really wanted to take advantage of my one week vacation to see my family. Once I arrive at the Helsinki airport (it was New Year's eve by the way,) I was told that my flight was cancelled. I had to wait in line 2 hours to be told by the service center staff that they cancelled the flight because they recently introduced a new type of aircrafts, and there were not enough pilots to fly this aircraft. I mean, what kind of an airline has shortage of their pilots, and if they are short on their pilots, why would they sell flight tickets? I was given two options at this point: take the same flight the day after, or reroute to Hong Kong, and go to Japan. I chose rerouting because I could get to Japan faster that way. In the end, I arrived at Japan with 12 hours delay from the initial plan and tired from longer flight time and increased transits. Of course I missed the New Year´s day celebration because of this. A week later, I go to the airport to go back to Madrid. Once they opened the ticket counter, I line up in order to have some time before heading to the gate, so that I can have the last breakfast with my family. However, when my turn comes, the ticket counter staff tells me that my seat is not found on their record. I show them all my travel documents and my printed itinerary. I had to wait in line another 1.5 hrs while they figured this out. In the beginning they told me I had to take a later flight. I insisted they would get me on the original plane because of work. Because this was technically a JAL flight (it was one of those weird flights where you buy tickets under a company's name, but it's actually ""operated by"" another airline), I was sent to JAL customer support center, where they found out that my name was not on the list because when they rerouted my first flights, Finnair did not do the necessary process required to get me on the return flight. A JAL staff was very helpful and she was the one who pressured Finnair to find me another seat in the original flight. In the end Finnair gives me a seat they could find in Economy comfort, which is a slightly better seat than normal economy. I was quite stressed because until the last moment they kept telling me they were not sure if I could get on board, and of course when they finally told me yes, I could barely say goodbye to my family because I literally had to run from the security check to the gate. In the end, I could get on the plane, and I was in my seat. At this point I was willing to get over this flight and have nothing to do with Finnair for the rest of my life. Then, while I´m reading, a couple comes to my seat, and asks me if I was sitting in the right seat. I show them my ticket, and they tell me, ""Oh no. We have the same ticket"" and shows me theirs. The cabin attendants had the nerve to tell me to move to Economy seat - (telling me it´s ""exactly the same seat"" which was a lie because the Economy seat has less leg room and inferior amenities) I had no choice but move to the inferior seat, really wishing that I had never chosen this airline.",False,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Madrid to Osaka via Helsinki,January 2017,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",1,1,,,False

He later explained that green tea is not popular on the European flights so the company does not stock those but he always keeps several teabags for his Asian passengers. Arrival in Helsinki was early and the transit to the long haul flight has to be one of the easiest. The flight to Hong Kong was full and the atmosphere was very different.

"""Inflight service was also poor"" ",2,2016-09-07,"Very disappointed. Finnair's service was very poor and disorganized right from the start. JFK ground services did not handle boarding as it should. No information was given about boarding groups etc. so it just ended up being a big mess at the gate. Priority boarding was totally useless since they were letting everybody in at the same time. For example American Airlines flight to Paris CDG was boarding at the same time as my flight, and since they handled their boarding procedures so well, it felt really bad to experience the chaos Finnair's ground staff managed to create. I opted for Economy comfort. The seat was worn-out, the bottom part was almost ripped of and the recline mechanism got stuck when lowered and had to be pulled back to upright position. Inflight service was also poor and a bit strange. Somehow Finnair's inflight service takes ages to be completed. First drinks came two hours after takeoff and it took almost 4 hours for the whole service to be completed. And since they serve the breakfast around 1.5 hours before landing, that leaves you with a 2.5 hours gap where you can sleep without an interruption of cabin announcing something. Thats not too much considering you are flying overnight. The service was just ok but the crew seemed to be really tired and unmotivated. No smiles, no nothing. Usually they serve 2 rounds of complimentary drinks, first round with the food and right after dinner a second round for refills. More drinks are available for purchase and soft drinks/water are free of charge. This time they only did one round. Usually Finnair's flight attendants also serve more water for passengers couple of times during the flight but this time they didn't. It felt like the cabin crew were lazy and didn't follow the normal procedures. This is totally unacceptable. Of course economy is not like business class, but for instance BA and AA are taking good care of their economy class passengers and thats why its always a pleasure to fly with them. One thing really bothered me was the way every single announcement was made. And there was a lot of them. Finnair is showing safety and info videos during take off and landing. These clips are really slow paced and long. Feels like the info is being given to a child. For example AA's videos are much shorter and made really well. There was almost 10-12 different announcements during the flight. A few actually repeated twice within 5 minutes. And most of these were also slow paced and spoken in Finnish, Swedish and English. When you add this all up, its just too much. Of course the information is important but they could be more efficient and also respect the comfort of their passengers. Sleeping was basically impossible during 5,5 hours of my 8 hour flight, since there were announcement after another. I was using noise canceling headphones provided in Finnair's premium economy package and they need to be attached to the audio system to make them work. I didn't find a mute button in their entertainment system so I had to listen every single announcement.

Check-in at the Priority counter in Helsinki a breeze, despite all the crowds in the single AY departure hall at something that must be their busiest time of the day. Business Class also gave me the priority line through security which took place in just a minute or two. After the Security Control, you're forced directly to narrow lanes crossing a busy shopping centre full of passengers just trying to get through to their planes, blocking the walkways. Even if shopping in the Schengen area of Helsinki airport is no longer of interest to passengers travelling within EU, the whole airport is now packed with people panicking to reach their departure gates in time. They’ve even cut down the seating areas at all the gates, forcing passengers to hang around, wherever they can. Forget the days, when Helsinki airport was a pleasant experience! Same goes for the Finnair Business Class lounge. Previously, a quiet and pleasant oasis, but now totally packed, with people queuing for food or drinks, not to talk about seats. Not surprising as Finnair now even sells entrance to their Business lounge for its Economy passengers, too. Boarding the A321 went rather smoothly, although the so called Priority boarding was announced so shortly before the general one that most Business Class passengers ended up in the same queue in the jetbridge, as everyone else. The Business cabin on this flight consisted of just three rows and the only difference to Economy was that the middle seat was free and it contained a pillow and a blanket. After the usual pilot's welcome greetings in English, Finnish and Swedish, surprise: all cabin announcements were only made in English and Spanish, to the big surprise of all the Finns on board their national carrier. Later on during the flight it became clear that the entire cabin crew was Spanish, without any notions of Finnish. Soon after take-off the menus were handed out and apéritif was served. Despite all its cost cutting measures, I was pleased to see that Finnair continues to serve all the drinks in Business in design glass ware. Soon, dinner was served on a single tray, which for a four-hour long flight is rather disappointing. The food itself was decent, but nothing to write home about. Champagne, wines and after dinner drinks were kindly offered by the cabin attendants throughout the flight. One major downside, though; the instant coffee served after dinner was totally undrinkable and even the stewardess had to admit. In economy, where coffee is about the only thing served free of charge this could be acceptable, but in Business?! After dinner, the crew showed up every now and then for more drinks. Landed in Madrid well ahead of schedule, but after a long taxi, found ourselves far from the terminal, which meant a transfer by bus. No exclusive one for Business Class passengers, but had to wait for the whole bus to fill up, before we were taken to the terminal.

The flight from Helsinki to Budapest was completely different, it was clean, the staff were significantly more polite, the bathrooms worked. My issue is that if you are going to charge a non budget airline price then you should provide that service. If you charge for food and drinks then stop pretending you're not EasyJet or Ryanair and price yourselves accordingly. Finnair charges British Airways prices.

They confirmed it was full as did the staff at the gate.

In addition despite being ""full"" adjacent seats 29A/C were empty, which was lucky as several seats in our section were ""broken"" and the cabin crew had to move people to these empty seats before take off. So zero points for the Finnair seat allocation system and the ground staff's attempt to sort the matter out. Then the true nightmare started.

Finnair customer review,10,2015-06-06,AY840 LHR-HEL Business Class and AY81 HEL-SIN Economy. The first leg from Heathrow to Helsinki on their intra- European Business Class product was flawless. The aircraft used was a modern Airbus A320. From start to finish every aspect of the journey was top class. Finnair shares the Business Class lounge at Heathrow Terminal 3 with its Oneworld partner Cathay Pacific. The lounge was comfortable with a decent offering of food and a generous offering of alcoholic spirits wine and beer. Boarding was announced in the lounge and by the time I arrived at the gate most passengers had boarded and there was no long queue. No hassle from check in to boarding. Finnair ground crew were brilliant! Flight departed on time. Intra-European Business Class uses the same seats as in economy but with the middle row empty for more space and privacy. The flight attendant in charge of the Business cabin was very attentive and went above and beyond to make passengers comfortable. Dinner was served efficiently although there was only one meal option for Business Class. It was rather odd to find a curry being served in Business Class on an intra-European flight but overall the smoked meats and champagne compensated for this. The crew accommodated passengers who could not eat curry by allowing them to choose meals from the Economy menu. A fine selection of liquors along with coffee and tea service followed dinner. The crew kept refreshing drinks throughout. Arrived in Helsinki on time. Used to flying on Finnair intra-European economy product where it feels more like a budget carrier so it was very refreshing to have such high quality service on their Business Class product. AY 81 HEL-SIN Economy: Had a 2.5 hour layover at Helsinki and used their non-Schengen lounge. It was spacious with light food and snacks and an extensive range of alcoholic and soft drinks. The lounge got a bit crowded after 10 pm with several high capacity flights departing for the Far East at the same time. Could not get an upgrade on this sector. Aircraft used was the ex-Air France Airbus A340-300 (OH-LQG) with its wonderfully dated interior which always brings back fond memories of the 1990s and early 2000s. I've flown on this an OH-LQF many times before and contrary to other reviews I find this aircraft to be up to par. IFC worked properly and there was a decent selection of movies and television shows to keep me occupied on the 11.5 hour flight. The cabin crew were not Finnish but were mostly from Singapore as I came to learn. They were highly attentive and professional always coming around the with water throughout.

IFE selection was nothing special but had a good spread of films and TV shows to keep one entertained for 11 hours. Muslim meal consisted of local Singapore food which was alright. My main complaint would be the lack of beverage service throughout the flight. Attendants came out sporadically offering cups of water. Security and passport control in HEL took 15 mins.

Irritatingly it seemed as if there was no effort to speed up the boarding process to make up for lost time. Flight was operated on a new A321.

SIN sector operated on a refurbished A343 and was similar to the outbound flight. However the flight was delayed by 1 hour due to broken ground equipment. Updates were given by the captain which was nice. Food was extremely bland. The muslim meal consisted of the same dish for both dinner and breakfast.

I have flown to Australia many times and I can honestly say Finnair is definitely the worst flying experience I have had. Through the alliance we also flew with Qantas and BA and what a difference it may to our trip. On the return trip the 11 hour flight was in a Finnair plane that was so old it had ashtrays. The inflight entertainment was laughable and the food awful. We went for the vegetarian option and for some reason all through the flights it was served first and as we were second to last row and we were not given the non veggie option we presumed they had not catered for us. Well that apparently wasn't the case and I was told off by the air stewardess. During the sleep time I had to take my medication and as there was a tray of snacks I presumed that I could take a biscuit as I had to take it with food well the look I got and I then noticed the snacks were removed to obviously make a point. Not only was the trip back very tiring but also a horrible experience.

Finnair customer review,8,2015-04-17,Stockholm - Helsinki - Tokyo return. We paid a bit extra to sit in the Economy Extra zone. It was well worth the money to get some more legroom and the noise-canceling headphones were very nice. However there is some room for improvement when it comes to the new headrests. The service was alright although on the outbound journey they had two meat options for dinner and nothing else.

Finnair customer review,3,2015-04-16,DEL-HEL-DEL. A lower than budget experience for a higher than budget price. This is the second time I am flying this route with Finnair. The only positives are that the flight arrives on time. The IFE is virtually non existent. My IFE screen was not working properly and kept getting jammed even after rebooting it twice so I just resorted to looking out of the window for 7hrs. On the way back the IFE was working but had very limited movies to showcase out of which most are very old. The food is bland. On the way to Helsinki I asked for the non veg meal which supposedly had run out even though I was seated in row 22 which is relatively in front for economy class. Same was the story on the return flight. I am a Singaporean who lives in India and know that contrary to popular belief most Indians do consume meat. On the flight most people were asking for meat and told that it was not available. I request carriers to discard the stereotype and provide meat dishes on flights to India. The meal was quite bland and inedible.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,,False

Staff were courteous and efficient and the food service was significantly better than other international carriers. Downside was the IFE. It was terrible! Limited options minuscule screen with antiquated graphics and a music section that was virtually defunct because of some licensing issue made this a useless addition to the flight.

Finnair customer review,,2015-02-06,I flew DXB-HEL-RVN and return 23-26 Jan. Outbound DXB-HEL was almost 2 hrs delayed but not due to AY's fault. Most of that delay was spent on-board an A321 extending the stay on this inappropriate aircraft for such a flight from 6 to almost 8 hrs. 8 hours on an aircraft AY uses for domestic flights in the very same seat configuration. Luckily I had 2 empty seats next to me making things reasonably comfortable since the leg space is ridiculous. The 1 round of juices served whilst waiting on the DXB tarmac were the last free cold drinks served ever since even the water had to be paid for! On a 6 hour flight with a supposed 4* airline they charge for water unbelievable! Despite my delay into HEL I made my connection for the 1 hr flight to RVN on an A320 with the same poor leg space (but adequate for such a short hop) and on this domestic flight they served free water and berry juice same on the return. I didn't look forward to the return HEL-DXB since I already figured out it would be a full flight. Already expecting the worst in discomfort and catering I bought sandwiches and water at HEL for almost EUR 20.00 but the reality exceeded my fears. Once again it was the A321 and it was full of Finnish holiday makers although it was sold as a scheduled flight. The only free drinks were the tea/coffee after the meal. Wine was sold at EUR 6.00 for tiny bottles of less than 200ml and what they called lunch was a farce in size and disgusting both in terms of looks and taste. However the worst of all was the ridiculous leg space especially sitting in an aisle seat close to the only 2 toilets at the back of the aircraft. All except 8 business class (if one can even call it that) passengers had access to 2 toilets on a 6 hour flight with an almost permanent queue in the aisle of up to a dozen chatting people. I take around 100 flights a year on various airlines but HEL-DXB must have been the very worst one over the last 10 years. I don't mind flying low cost at least I know what to expect or rather 'not' to expect given the price but an airline like AY should be ashamed of operating the DXB route in this disgraceful manner and with such inappropriate aircraft.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,,False

Finnair customer review,10,2015-01-11,I've been negligent in writing this review. I reviewed Finnair about three months ago and gave them a terrible rating which was true of my experience at that time. This flight was already booked otherwise there was no way I'd have flown them again which was very fortunate for me. The equipment was their new airbus and made all the difference. This was an excellent experience and compares with prior ones that I've had with Finnair. I'm happy to report that they deserve their 4 star rating. In my prior review I would not have given them a three. I flew Bangkok to Helsinki and then on to Madrid return in business class. I would recommend them highly and especially so with their excellent pricing. The seat was a little tight. I found it somewhat difficult to to get up for breaks. Definitely tight.

So if you are expecting something much more fancy you will be disappointed. But for us the flight went just fine. Very punctual with all parts of the trip and very friendly staff at all ends. The one thing we were disappointed with is that once you pay for your flight then you have to go in and pay additional for any seat you select not just upgrade to an aisle seat.

CP lounge in T3 which was ok mid morning and not too far from gate. On to plane and welcomed by friendly FAs. Enjoyable light meal and fair selection of wines. Arrived in Helsinki on time and short stopover in lounge before long haul to BKK. Early evening into overnight flight so straight to sleep after meal. Didn't use the entertainment system at all. Arrived on time in BKK and used Priority pass through customs but in all honesty the airport was fairly quiet that time of the morning. return from BKK mid morning departure. CP lounge in Zone G was a bit average really. Small selection of nibbles and coffee. Spirits and beer yes but no fizz for my juice. Flight left 25 mins late and we only had 45 minutes in Helsinki anyway so it was going to be tight to make our connection. during the daytime flight watched a couple of films and listened to a small selection of music slept a little and generally felt comfortable and relaxed throughout. Food was good. Purser spoke to all passengers with onward connections and we were diverted to the short connections security check and whizzed through and on to our plane to LHR in under 15 minutes. All very efficient. Bussed to the LHR flight which pushed away on time and landed about 5 minutes late. Our bags were first to arrive on the carousel back in T3 and we went from plane to our car in under 30 minutes!

Finnair customer review,10,2014-11-20,Recently flew GVA-HEL-NRT return in business class. Was very impressed. The short-haul flights are a bit of a joke in business class as you have the same seats as economy the only difference being that a full meal is served. The long-haul flights were excellent the seats are comfortable particularly if you can grab one of the solo seats. Meals were good and snacks served half-way through the flight. Connecting in HEL is great. It's a small airport. On my return trip we had a 50 minute connection in HEL and I was a little concerned but amazingly 10 minutes after doors open on the long-haul flight I was through security passport control and waiting at the gate for the short-haul! On the way out it was snowing lightly and there was a light dusting of wet snow on the ground enough to bring airports like LHR to a grinding halt. At HEL it was business as usual. On the HEL-NRT flight they closed the aircraft doors about 10 minutes in advance of scheduled departure and within those 10 minutes de-iced the plane so that we pushed back bang on time.,False,,,Business Class,,,5,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,,True

We were served a sandwich soft drinks coffee and tea plus the lovely touch of some chocolate prior to landing. 4 days later I flew back and there was no free food no free soft drinks. Only tea coffee still water (no sparkling!) and inexplicably only blueberry juice! There was heavy sell of food from the selection they have on the price list. Even that little piece of chocolate is now gone! It is all fine and well to charge for food but this completion of transformation of this national airline is not reflected in their fares going down.

Service on the VIE-HEL was lacklustre and it took the FA's almost an hour to get the service started. Sandwich (tuna or turkey and cheese) was actually quite large for airline standards and tasty one round of drinks served beer and wine for purchase only. After collecting the trash FA's went pretty much again into hiding mode. The aircraft on the return flight was changed from an Airbus to a smaller Embraer 190 “ operated by Flybe. Information was given only during check-in. Not sure what 'operated by Flybe'” means in practical terms but it was a Finnair plane with a Flybe sticker beside the aircraft door with Finnair service and Finnish flight crew. Probably just a move to bring salary costs down. I find Embraers to be very comfortable planes and flight crew was attentive on the flight back to VIE. Catering was a substantial green and noodle salad again tasty. Web check-in was smooth although during the check-in process for the return flight we were asked if we would volunteer to give up our seats as the flight has obviously been overbooked. But no further information was given regarding alternative flights and compensation so we obviously denied. Boarding in HEL was a bit chaotic and delayed with no information given. However staff managed to board the plane very fast so flight was actually on-time. AY uses a shared lounge in VIE which is spacious with a decent drink and hot food selection. However the snacks offered are of extremely poor quality. Schengen AY lounge in HEL has greatly improved with the renovations almost finished. Now that the lounge is substantially larger it has still been well visited but was not over crowded. Food and drink selection has improved as well and was quite good.

Despite some of the complaints on this page I found the food to be excellent and much better and tastier than the Qantas leg SYD-HKG. My only real complaint is the design of the new business class seats. In my view spaciousness between seats has been sacrificed on the altar of float beds. A flat bed is not the be all and end all in my view - certainly not when you cannot move your feet. The leg room when fully reclined for one of the single seats is so small you have to have your feet at a perfect 90 degrees to your legs with no more than the width of a shoe box at the foot end. The double seats are the converse - they have better leg room but not so wide for the body and the seat next to the window is very claustrophobic.

Inflight service from the crew was good to very good food quality was OK for Y Class staff themselves were friendly and we got from A to B without incident and on time.

Finnair customer review,7,2014-10-12,Amsterdam to Singapore via Helsinki. Approached this flight with some trepidation after reading a lot of negative reviews on this product. Well it's definitely not Emirates but it also was not a bad experience for me. The connecting flight from Amsterdam was fine. A tiny curtained off Business section with economy seating with middle seats left vacant. A pleasant dinner good Champagne and on time. From Helsinki to Singapore was one of the old A340s (OH-LQA in this case). First impressions were favourable with the cabin being spacious and clean. We had pre flight drinks and a snack and left on time. Once seated I tried the seat out and it's more of a recliner but seemed ok. Menus drinks and dinner all happened smoothly and quickly. I thoroughly enjoyed my supper. It's a bit of a no frills offering but enjoyable and had nice wines also. IFE is poor. The screens are tiny and the offering is limited and old. Didn't really matter as I wanted to sleep as much as possible and despite the seat being at quite an angle I managed a few good hours. Breakfast was simple but tasty. So overall the experience was a good one - on time fed and slept well.

Truly a 4 star airline. Sad to say that is no longer the case. The plane was an older Airbus A340-300. The seats are not 180 degrees so difficult to sleep. The entertainment system was very poor. A small screen and less than 20 movies on offer. The food and the wine were the worst part. Two reds both 2012 and hardly drinkable. The food is worst than AA DL and UA and that's saying something. Have they put an accountant in charge of food service? The staff however were very good.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,,False
Finnair customer review,1,2014-10-01,I had to use Finnair twice within 2 weeks for lack of availability on Lufthansa / SAS flights which I normally use. For good reason. Trip was FRA-HEL- MP (15th and 23rd September) and return (19th and 25th September). Both times departure from FRA was delayed on the 23rd the departure gate was announced only a few minutes before boarding was supposed to start. The stopover time in HEL is only one hour and since my flight was not the only one that was late the connecting flight to TMP was also delayed. Both times. On the trip back on the 23rd I had no checked luggage - luckily. Seemed like the computers were down I had a mobile boarding pass but everyone had to be checked manually from a printed list free seating on the first leg of the flight - no announcement from the crew as to what was going on the guy sitting next to me asked about his connecting flight (we were about 30 minutes delayed) and was simply told he has to pick up and re-check his luggage in Helsinki then miss the flight or catch the flight and then try to find his luggage later on - lots of other people had similar issues but all that was said via the speaker system was that everyone has to pick up and re-check their luggage in Helsinki nothing else. Absolutely no customer service connecting flights wouldn't wait if you wanted to catch the flight you would have to leave your luggage. The same then happened in Helsinki as well nobody showed up at the gate to start the boarding process until about 40 minutes past the scheduled departure time. The lady had a printout and checked every name manually from that list. At least the assigned seats from prior online-check-in were still valid this time. On the first trip I had luggage checked and both in TMP as well as in FRA it took forever to get it from the belt. In Tampere the distance from the plane to the belt is maybe 30 meters. You'd think it would be manageable to unload the luggage in less time than 30 minutes (plane on that route is an ATR propeller-plane very small). In Frankfurt I understand that it takes longer but I have had plenty of Lufthansa flights with apron- positions and even on those the luggage was on the belt after about 20 minutes. Finnair needed about 45 minutes for that. Another thing is that the desk service in Frankfurt is really terrible. The staff that handles the baggage drop is the same that handles the boarding - very unfriendly and sometimes even ignoring questions. Last but not least - the food is horrid. Some dry sandwich or bun with veggies on them. Either a hot drink or a cold drink. Now I read they want to get rid of free snacks on the European routes altogether. Anyway I will not fly Finnair again not voluntarily anyhow. Lucky that I book my own business trips and that Lufthansa / SAS has excellent service on the route to Tampere.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,,False
Finnair customer review,1,2014-09-17,"Flight LHR-HEL-HKG and return. The flight to Helsinki was fine but the onwards flight to Hong Kong was a nightmare. The flight attendants looked like SS guards and acted similarly. Although there was some turbulence passengers were restrained from going to the toilets making for a great deal of discomfort. On arriving in Hong Kong things got worse. Those of us who arrived from London had no luggage and the lost luggage clerk told us ""that is not the second time this has happened this week"". Further enquiry confirmed it to be the third time. While the luggage did turn up a couple of days later this was a huge inconvenience and Finnair did not even bother answering our complaint. The return trip was staffed by similarly surly flight attendants so it too was less than an enjoyable experience. 1/10 based on the fact we arrived safely. The attitude of staff and their total lack of courtesy over the luggage merits the low score.",False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,2,,,False

Finnair customer review,9,2014-09-06,BKK-HEL-AMS in business class and very satisfied with value for money. Long haul from BKK to HEL was on one of the old Air France A340s which we understand will be retired from the AY fleet soon. The disappointment of not having the new flat-bed product was outweighed by all the other positives of this day time flight. The queue for economy class check-in at BKK was huge whereas there was no-one waiting at all at the business class check-in and we were quickly and efficiently dealt with by a friendly agent. The CIP lounge used by AY in Bangkok was more than adequate for a short wait with plenty of hot and cold breakfast options decent wi-fi clean toilets and comfortable lounge areas with decent chairs. Priority boarding worked well with a separate airbridge for business class and we were greeted warmly as we boarded and promptly handed a glass of champagne that was topped up twice before we taxied to the runway departing exactly on time. We were really pleased with the food at meal times and the snacks in-between meals the wines and the excellent cloudberry liquer - a must try! The FAs were present in the cabin throughout the entire flight and could not have been more pleasant or helpful. Although the business class seats on this plane were old and recline to a flat but sloping bed they were comfortable and spacious and for a day time flight were just fine. The IFE was also old and the screen was quite small but we easily managed to find some movies we hadn't seen before to pass the time. Our transit time at HEL was only 45 minutes though we needn't have worried as HEL is such an easy airport to navigate - we were at our boarding gate for the flight to AMS in plenty of time. This short flight to AMS was also excellent. Priority boarding again worked well the FAs again provided a great service the meal and wines were again good we arrived in AMS on time and our bags were amongst the first on the belt. The business class seats on intra-Europe flights are the same as economy with the middle seat kept free however we were seated in row 1 and had plenty of legroom and space. We have travelled from Asia to Europe in business class on numerous occasions over the past years with a variety of well-regarded airlines including QF BA EK and TG however our flights on AY were significantly cheaper than what these other airlines offer and we would fly business class with AY again without hesitation.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,,True

Finnair customer review,5,2014-08-28,Flew from Manchester to Singapore in July 2014. I was recommended the airline by an agent who described them as an 'up and coming' airline. Price was the attraction so I went with it. Having read the reviews I was somewhat apprehensive but in general it was okay. Let's take the positives - flight times suited us as we did not suffer jet lag on either journey even though sleep was difficult. Crew were efficient and flights were all on time or early. Total flight time is as good as it gets for this journey. Now the negatives - planes are old and tired the Airbus on the return flight even had ash trays. The breakfasts are inedible and the rest of the food is average to poor. Economy leg room is minimal for a 12 hour flight you certainly don't want to get next to anyone in the XL size range. Would I fly with them again - probably if the price is right.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,,False
Finnair customer review,9,2014-08-28,We flew Economy from SIN-HEL-LJU and then from DBV-HEL-SIN. The plane was an old but refurbished A340-300 and the IFE was updated. In terms of leg room and seat width it is as good as you can get in economy for long haul flights (I typically use SIA/Emirates/Qatar). Quality of the food served was average. Service was good and attentive. Transit in Helsinki airport was very smooth - we had two airport layovers. In all considering that we paid a very reasonable price we were very satisfied with Finnair and would recommend them. In fact because of my positive experience with them I have also decided to fly to Finnair SIN-MXP in October 2014.

Finnair customer review,5,2014-08-18,Flew SIN-HEL and then a few days later HEL-LHR. SIN-HEL - food was quite good had two rounds of the drinks trolley (you get free wine and beer on this route not spirits). Staff were friendly. Seats were ok. However entertainment was bad - VOD but nothing less than a year old. Also it's a 12hr overnight flight - why only dim lights for one hour?

Finnair customer review,5,2014-08-14,Flew SIN-HEL-ZRH return. With Finnair Business Class you get what you pay for. Finnair uses an old leased Air France Aircraft on these Routes and they have not been updated or refurbished for years. The seats are old and worn and certainly could use a bit of TLC. On the outward flight the inflight entertainment system in my seat was not working and the lights in Business Class could not be switched off during the night. Space is good but if in stretched out setting you tend to slide down the Seat. Cabin Service on all Flights was excellent but Cabin Crew were quite frustrated with the problems associated with those ageing aircraft's. The New Menu's advertised on Finnair websites was not offered on these Flights. Overall the Flights were reasonably Ok but Finnair Business Class on these old aircraft's is only second or third Tier compared to other Airlines.,False,,,Business Class,,,2,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,7,2014-08-11,Flew MH to SIN in June 2014 and a CX+AY combo back late July - all Oneworld carriers. AY uses their A340-300 on the HKG route and was lucky to get OH-LQC (year 2007) on the HKG-HEL leg with their latest greyish interior and newest IFE. Some operational problems at HKG Airport: the plane was taken to gate at midnight just 20 mins before departure and finally took off 2 hours late due to heavy traffic but arrival at Helsinki Airport only 30 mins late. Was lucky to get two seats on the last row for myself on this full flight but the IFE didn't work on either seat so slept all the way. Two hot meals served on this 10 hr flight: two meal choices at night but only one option for breakfast - hot meals quite small but otherwise OK. Leg room and seat comfort was good enough for a 7-hour sleep. Cabin crew professional and friendly (a mix of Finnish and Asian cabin crew) and the flight pleasant in general but cost cutting is visible in many areas which quite frankly puts Finnair way behind MH or CX.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,3,,,True

Finnair customer review,9,2014-08-03,BKK-HEL-CPH on Economy. At the gate I was upgraded to a business class seat at no cost. This was very impressive as I bought tickets on Economy. As soon as I boarded the plane a welcome drink was served - either champagne or orange juice together with a large choice of newspapers. I was flying on a rather old A340. The seat was alright - almost lie-flat and pretty comfortable. Only bad thing was the AVOD it was really poor. As soon as we took off the excellent service started. We got a menu knowing that we would be served a 3-course menu plus a light meal before landing (9am - 3pm flight). It consisted of an appetizer a light meal before the main course. Main course and dessert with coffee and tea. Light meal before landing. All drinks both alcoholic and non- alcoholic were of course free. There was also a rather extensive wine list which I enjoyed. Throughout the flight they offered snacks (fresh fruit noodles nuts chocolates sandwiches chips and muffins in all forms) together with drinks and coffee/tea. Cabin crew were very friendly very pro-active and made sure everyone had a good time. Food was excellent together with the cabin crew. Only negatives are the time of day and their AVOD.

In the lounge they were missing milk bread and salad dressing. At the international side of the airport the lounge was stylish but lacking in comfort and options. The seats on the plane were uncomfortably small and the leg space was very limited. The customer service on the plane was poor the stewardesses were unfriendly and never smiled one stewardess was charging customers for non-alcoholic drinks until a customer pointed out that they were free (as this was an international flight) the food was mediocre and the entertainment system was limited with few good movies.

Seat was bad like I knew beforehand but it was alright as it was a day flight. Entertainment system was very bad worst I've seen. I know that they are going to replace the plane next year but still it was not a very good experience in regards of flying in Business. They should have provided at least some Tablets for entertainment etc. Return flight was worse: It was too hot and the Asian-Western - fusion menu was not good. I didn't want any rice or noodles I wanted to eat something good quality - European/Western prime meat or some Mediterranean fresh dishes combined with good nice wine most of the 3 mains were oriental style and the selection was worse than inbound flight. Sleeping was not possible because of the heat in the cabin and also because of the angle of their seats.

Finnair has some problems with the plane they usually use in this route it was being repaired and Finnair used another plane. The plane Finnair decided to use was rented from Privilege Style Airline Spain. This replacement plane was the worst I have ever flown with and I fly quite a lot. I'm totally blown away that Finnair decided to use worn out plane with no entertainment system on intercontinental long haul route. This is total underestimation of customers. Finnair is marketing the route with good planes comfort entertainment systems etc. The service I received was really bad seats were worn out (they had ashtrays) plane was worn out and no entertainment system at all. Finnair made a decision to rent this plane it means that they clearly do not think their customers. Really bad.

Finnair customer review,7,2014-06-16,LHR-BKK return in April/May in business cabin. The odds were against it being a perfect experience from the start as when I'd booked it both long-haul flights were on their A330s with the 'new' lie-flat beds. A few months out and one of the flights changed to their ex AF A340s a month out and both flights changed. Felt like a bait and switch. Frankly would have booked on Austrian if I'd known there was the chance of the hard product being downgraded. Flight from London - HEL was nice in one of their new A321s with sharklets - I've done this route before and realised that frankly the older planes are better. They have the dropdown screens that show you take- off and landings and track the flight. The A321s are really bare bones in terms of passenger amenities I understand they're planned for AYs leisure routes. A plus though was the friendly cabin service ok catering and a samsung 8 inch tab they handed out with pre-loaded videos films and music. HEL airport and lounge again ok nothing much to write home about. HEL-BKK in the A340 - Ok have to say it's not as bad as lots of people make it out to be (at least up front) - I'm not sure if the galleys are different on it so AY just serves their much publicised new menus on the A330s - So again food was more standard fare than what you were led to expect from the website. Seat recline is good for an angled bed expect it to be 170 degrees. However cabin way too hot for comfort and the cabin does deserve a spring clean - hear that Finnair? Honestly the dark beige plastic shell of the seats on closer look started life as light beige plastic. Didn't help that my friend's tray table and video screen was covered in coffee - I spent 5 minutes when we got aloft wiping down all our touchable surfaces within reach as a result. Food and drink selection quite decent have to say had the tastiest (if not most elegant) breakfast ever and freshest croissant. Flight back from Bangkok similar but no cleaning required loved the mid flight snack brought round on a presentation trolley with fruit salad and fresh hot cinnamon buns a lovely touch but no sandwiches pot noodles etc for a savoury alternative. Transfer in HEL you have to go through security which is a pain but we were soon through and being bussed (another distinct disadvantage to HEL) out to the A321 back to LHR - Crew great on this leg too.

As other disgruntled Finnair travelers have noted the flight was delayed in my case by just a little over an hour however this seems to be a recurring problem with Finnair. I was extremely disappointed with the entertainment system provided the audio quality was so poor in the movies I finally just switched the thing off and spent the remainder of the flight trying to get comfortable in a ridiculously cramped seat. The food and beverage service was not much better. The food could only be described as adequate and Finnair only provided complimentary wine with the first meal if you want more you have to purchase it at 6 Euros per glass which is a ridiculous price for non-premium wine and there are no complimentary alcoholic drinks other than the beer/wine option with the first meal (this also compares poorly again with BA which makes all alcoholic drinks free for the entire flight).

Finnair customer review,5,2014-01-30,LHR-HEL-SIN HKG-HEL in Jan 2014. Short haul was pleasant. Lounge at Helsinki was fairly quiet but this obviously depends on the time of day. On HEL-SIN sector we had seats 6 A and C bulkhead in the A340. We got some rest but the seat is not conducive to sleep. Why on earth any airline serves a meal at midnight defeats me so we declined and tried to get some sleep. On arrival at SIN we had use of Qantas lounge for our ongoing flight with BA codeshare. Overall the flight and lounges for the outgoing sector were fine. The return was awful: Finnair uses Plaza Premium lounge at HK which is poorly equipped uncomfortable old seating and it's a very long walk to the gates. No announcements were made (and we were told this) but the only flight screen info is one which scrolls through the next 24 hrs flights. With no help from the lounge staff we decided to make our way to the gate about 45 mins before departure: a good thing we did since the flight was not showing as boarding as we left the lounge but the extremely long walk to the gate meant that we were some of the last to board. Although the flight was scheduled to be on an A330 with flat bed seats it was an old 340 and sleep was difficult. Staff are pleasant but not particularly proactive. Not sure I'd fly with AY business again unless I was assured of a flat bed. I understand they are upgrading most of the fleet this year.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,4,2014-01-28,FRA-HEL-HKG. First time that I took Finnair and I was rather disappointed. Positives: FRA-HEL was very convenient comfortable seats decent food quick transfer at Helsinki airport free WIFI at the airport. However the flight to Hong Kong was horrible. The plane was about 20 years old (it still had ashtrays in every seat) seats were very uncomfortable service was slow and unfriendly (only four FA for the whole economy class) and the food was uneatable.

The plane the A340-300 love this old beast its shorter than the 600 series handles bad weather better not sure what all the other people are moaning about.

Finnair customer review,8,2014-01-13,Riga-Helsinki-Beijing in Economy. We redeemed two Finnair tickets using Qantas points. Finnair sent us a couple of welcome emails and highlighted the online check in option. We did online check in 24 hours before the departure. As a Oneworld Sapphire member we picked front row seats. Check in at Riga airport was eventful staff are not really familiar with Beijing's 72 hours transit visa on arrival. It took a while for her to understand and sorted out all the luggage and boarding passes. Finnair is using Riga's airport lounge It is a very nice lounge. Finnair's subsidiary flyBe is flying Riga to Helsinki. It was a full flight and cabin crews are very friendly and helpful. Transit in Helsinki is very easy.

Finnair customer review,5,2014-01-02,"Helsinki to Bangkok in Business Class. Boarding was made by bus so no priority for Business passengers - Shame. Very old plane (A340) with old seats and very ancient IFE! Screens did not work properly and the picture was with bad quality. Food on board was not very tasty but ok. They also forgot the printed menu lists on board so I could not choose what to eat really. I don't like their new menu because they try to serve you some ""fusion Asian"" with no Western options. Wines on board are still ok. The staff was mature like always on Finnair flights not very happy looking but still ok. Asian stewards were the best and most polite.

The new Seat (Full Flat) is amazing. We had the old Seat on the Way back. Good enough and AY are losing those Seat mostly in 2014. Food ist good - I like the signature Soup. It's a nice touch. Crew - as on every Euro-Airlines. So and So. But mostly friendly older Ladies. Overall for the Prices offered the best Choice in Oneworld. I found the IFE to be better than I read here. Although its surely not a System like Qatar's or Emirates. Big Plus: The Stress-Free Airport. Small nice connecting in Helsinki is bliss.

Finnair customer review,7,2013-11-21,Helsinki to Madrid in Business Class in October 2013. They exceptionally used a larger A330 aircraft on this four hour flight it was a special training flight for their new Spanish crews. The crew training made the service a bit slow but on the hand the passengers got some extra attention overall the crew was attentive and friendly.

No apology given. There was no legroom and when the person in the seat in front reclined their seat there was no room to move at all. The seats were uncomfortable and hard.

Finnair customer review,3,2013-11-21,I flew from Hong Kong to Helsinki via Finnair. I was shocked by the seat layout of this plane I really had to wonder was this Finnair? The seats were the most uncomfortable smallest ones I have sat in ever and I have travelled quite a bit. The inflight entertainment units were basically mid 90s gameboys! Ryanair etc had more leg room and general comfort. Perhaps for a short flight such extremely uncomfortable seating arrangements would be ok but for a 10 hour flight it was a joke.

Finnair customer review,7,2013-11-20,Flew business class from London to Helsinki then on to Singapore return from Hong Kong to Helskini. You get what you pay for. Finnair are operating OH-LYF and OH-LYG Airbus A340s on these routes which are 16 year old Air France aircraft. Cabins had not been refurbished in November 13 just refreshed. Despite the dated and worn feel of the cabin comfort was actually pretty good and I was able to sleep on both long haul legs on the angled lie flat bed. Power at seat is for French or American adapters and did not work on either leg. IFE is basic unbranded and offers a small selection of on demand video music etc delivered via a low resolution screen. Headphone socket is standard aircraft twin jack you can bring your own headphones if you wish. Food was very good and cabin crew were excellent on the outbound and good on the return. On the return the aircraft lighting wasn't behaving itself and the automatic safety briefing wouldn't work these aircraft are showing their age! The main problem was this trip was living with the uncertainty of if the flights would be cancelled due to Finnair staff strikes. Also on the short haul first trip out a catering strike meant only cheese sandwiches were available! To be fair to Finnair they keep you up to date. Overall given the price this is a competitive and value for money way to get to Asia in comfort. Helsinki airport is brilliant for transfers which only involve a 100 yard walk from one gate to the next. If Finnair updated their tired planes on the routes and sorted out their Unions this could be excellent.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,5,,,True
Finnair customer review,7,2013-11-19,Flights Hamburg to Helsinki and to Bangkok in Business. Flight Hamburg to Helsinki (AY 2854) poor Catering in Business due to a strike of caterers. Unacceptable waiting time in the airport bus at the aircraft. Boxes of cheese sandwiches were be delivered while the passengers were stuck in the bus in front of the airplane. Bad co- ordination. Apparently no contact between check-in counter and cockpit. Flight 089 from Helsinki to Bangkok smooth and with normal business service. In Bangkok surprisingly Vouchers for the Immigration Fast Tracks. Finnair Germany told me before there were no Vouchers for Fast Track. That's why I paid a VIP Service at Bangkok Arrivals. In vain. Finnair in Europe obviously don't know that they offer Immigration Fast Track permissions to their passengers. Not very professional.

Finnair customer review,3,2013-11-18,The flight was on time and it got us there safely. Helsinki to Hong Kong. However we were travelling with an infant of 13 months who we had to pay almost 50 euros extra for. That was fine as all airlines charge for infants even sitting on our laps but while other airlines would automatically give us the baby friendly seats (i.e. the first row of the cabin) Finnair wanted to charge us extra for it (remember we have already paid for our baby). I called the UK office a few days before our flight to check if our seats would be automatically allocated due to us travelling with an infant. I was told by a friendly staff that I had to wait unless I pay. I then checked two days before our flight I discovered that we were allocated to the centre of the centre row in the middle of the cabin! Since we were flying an Airbus A320 we would have fellow passengers on either side of us. So I had to call again to explain it would not be very convenient for us and for other passengers. It took another day before our seats were rearranged to the side of the aircraft. So I would say don't go with Finnair if you intended to travel long haul with a baby. Unless you want to paid twice for the baby. Overall we found the seat less comfortable than other airlines on a similar route and the food portion was on the small side. When we return we are going to paid the extra (120 Euros for the two of us) for the baby friendly seat because we can't face another 10 hours cramped in two seats. We are not looking forward to our return flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,2,,,False

Finnair customer review,7,2013-10-22,"HEL-JFK-HEL in October. A333 OH-LTT on both flights. Flights on time boarding efficient. Spacious cabin leg room surprisingly alright (especially if there was no IFE box under the seat in front of you). Online check-in so-so: had to try 4 times to get one of our party of 3 checked-in with the other two there were no problems. Got to choose our seats from what seats were still available which was fine. We also had quite a lot of trouble with their online services before the flight. Cabin crew very nice on first flight on second flight a bit brusque except one male FA who was working at the rear of the galley and proved to be both courteous and funny. Finnish accent quite heavy in all the PA announcements made in English. On return flight the First Officer gave a humorous ""welcome to Helsinki"" by describing - very accurately - the currently lousy weather conditions. Pre- ordered gluten-free meals had to be personally asked for onboard but once delivered were tasty. Although the gluten-free breakfast with Finnair is an insult: a banana and one dry rice cake wrapped in plastic. The regular economy meals seem to come with a choice of two (a vegetarian pasta or chicken etc.) but on second flight there was no choice left when the meal service reached the rear rows of the cabin. Wine beer and sodas are served free of charge spirits you have to pay for in economy. IFE perhaps a bit limited with choice compared to other airlines but we found it sufficient enough. Bonus points for Finnair for their exciting ""Front camera"" view as a part of their IFE service especially if it's available during take off. Before landing on JFK FA's announced that when returning to Finland make sure you have enough time for the long lines to security check. Well at bag drop at JFK the Finnair desk doesn't open until some 2 hours before boarding time. A bit mixed messages perhaps? All in all Finnair does it's job: takes you safely there and back with decent food and some entertainment.

Finnair customer review,3,2013-10-20,Went for Business Class because of the reasonable pricing. While travelling from Delhi to Helsinki to Paris the aircraft for the DEL-HEL sector was an A330 fitted out with the new Finnair business class seats and decor. It was reasonable the flight was comfortable I missed the flat bed but overall it was not uncomfortable. Food was decent too - no complaints. From Helsinki to Paris the business class turned out to be disappointing economy class seats with the middle seat left vacant. There was no entertainment and not much variety of food but still decent. On the way back from Amsterdam to Helsinki in business class same situation as Helsinki to Paris but bearable and food this time was pretty good. The horror started from Helsinki to Delhi. Flight was delayed by over 5 hours and the Finnair lounge where I was stuck had atrociously little food. From lunch through to dinner there was nothing except salad a coldish sweet potato soup and just one main dish of chilli con carne. After boarding the flight which this time was an A300 I realised that this still had the old business class which was uncomfortable. The food was decent but the air temp they maintained in the cabin was atrociously warm and I kept waking up through the night sweating. I requested them to regulate the AC better but no luck. The worst part was the beds it contorts to all sorts of angles if you are trying to sleep and your spine is pushed up and you nearly slide down because the leg rest is maintained at such an odd angle. I kept trying to push myself up through the night as I kept sliding down and I saw the same thing happen to several people. It is absolutely unacceptable. Finally I had no choice but to just sit upright.

Finnair customer review,7,2013-10-06,Flew Hong Kong-Helsinki on AY070 10th Sep in business class. This was a connecting flight so the hope was our baggage would follow as planned. It did. Finnair use a generic business lounge in HK. Unfortunately it is not advertised anywhere or is any advice given where to find it. We ended up at a lounge which was not the intended lounge but the staff after a number of phone calls let us in. Evidently the lounge we should have used was at the other end of the airport and a distance away from the gate. Knowledge is good! Boarding was good and on time - priority boarding. Our aircraft was clean and the seating whilst not the most up to date arrangement it was comfortable - angled not lie flat. We did not sample dinner as this was an overnight flight and we were tired. We slept for 5-6 hours. Breakfast was a simple affair but was edible. The inflight entertainment was very average as far as choice was concerned.

Food I believe was very average but don't really know as I couldn't really eat when the passenger in front reclined their seats into my face.

On my return flight to Hong Kong from Helsinki Finnair were using old Air France planes which do not even have the business class seats you actually pay for when you purchase a Business class ticket. The seats in these leased old Air France planes are dirty old and extremely worn out and the equipment is completely outdated. Don't get me started on the entertainment if you can call it that.

I asked the man kindly if I could have a seat along the aisle twice. He didn't even reply. When I found out that my light didn't work on a 12 hour flight I was mad.

While the plane was comfortable enough the inflight entertainment was quite limited and dated amazingly compared to Jetstar even! For a long haul flight however the food was almost indelible. Dinner was no choice some bland rice and meat dish. The most hilarious was breakfast though some kind of instant quiche soggy potato chips (for breakfast) soggy green beans and a sausage. I was quite amazed. I've lived in Finland and know food is not their forte but wow. Throughout the flight the attendants were quite brusque and when asked for a beer I was told that they're busy and a drinks cart will come eventually. When they did I was told that hardly any of the drinks on the menu where available. So I just stuck with water.

However this Airline has the worst inflight entertainment options I have ever come across. Choice of about five movies 2 or 3 of which were new. Made for a very dull return leg as none of these had been changed by the time I flew back two weeks later. Business class seat was very uncomfortable and beaten up and the airline was facing a catering strike so the food was simply appalling and not up to standard which I would have found acceptable if they let me know at check-in so I could have stocked up before the flight. Overall I felt as though the airline has done nothing since that aircraft went into service in 1990. No upgrades no replacement of broken parts no moving with technology no development of service.

I used the Japan Airlines lounge in Bangkok for breakfast and was tired when boarding. Yes the first meal is lunch and served soon after take-off so I asked the friendly crew to save it for me later in the flight which wasn't a problem. After about 4 hours sleep on the comfy flay bed crew offered to serve me lunch which was fine if not the best. In flight entertainment has a smaller selection than most but was good enough.

My wife and I were seated in the back row of the plane as I had asked for the seats with the most leg room when I checked into the airport. I am 5'11"" weight 200 lbs. I could not even get my legs in front of me so they had to be in the aisle for the whole 8 hour and 50 minute flight. Our seat backs were stationary adding to the discomfort and when the gentleman in front put his seat back we were almost trapped in our seats. After the safety demo I asked the stewardess how I was to assume the crash safety position and she said i would not be able to do so.

Finnair customer review,2,2013-09-02,Could hardly disagree more with the other 27 Aug reviewer. I flew the same day - possibly on the same plane - and found it intolerable. I'm 197cm but can get adequately comfortable in most short-haul economy but not this the hard plastic strip concealing the seat hinges cut into my shins while the rigid seat back was pressed hard against my knees. Bad enough as a static sensation until the oversized baboon in front can't sit still and slams his seat into me every other minute. I seldom refuse food while travelling but the 'tandoori turkey' (the clue is in the title) sandwich was dry and inedible. With no wine on offer to improve it and no space to unfold the table for a cup of coffee a solitary glass of water had to do for sustenance on a three-hour flight. The crew were pleasant enough. I'll be flying this route again but next time I'll make sure my BA ticket gets me on a BA plane.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,,,2,,,False
Finnair customer review,5,2013-09-02,BKK-HEL-BKK A330 business class flat-bed seats. Three problems with the 10-hour outward flight. When you have to get up around 06.00 for an 09.00 departure the obvious first meal should be breakfast or at the very least brunch. Not so on AY where a full lunch is inexplicably served before 10.00. It then serves a second reduced lunch prior to landing. If the poor lounge served some breakfast foods then perhaps I might understand. But the uncomfortable Louis Tavern has no breakfast food at all! For a long daytime flight a good breakfast is surely a must. Secondly the touch-screen AV selection is poor with almost the worst selection of mostly old movies I have experienced in recent years. Thirdly and least pleasantly the cabin smelt faintly of a toilet throughout most of the flight. I will not take this flight again until meals are more in tune with the time of departure. On the return sector meals were also rather unsatisfactory. Dessert and cheese for dinner each amounted to no more than a couple of mouthfuls. The breakfast scrambled eggs were bland and the croissants served cold. On both flights I found the rather narrow flat bed seats surprisingly uncomfortable. Switching off the AV system a full 25 minutes prior to landing was extremely annoying and seems inexplicable. The rather officious unsmiling purser pointed out this is company policy!,False,,,Business Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,,False
Finnair customer review,8,2013-08-26,London Heathrow - Helsinki. Very friendly on time and comfortable flights both ways. Finnair's latest economy cabin revamp showed on the Airbus A320s with nice colours of grey and blue and new recaro seats. Actual seat comfort and legroom was average however. Cabin was clean and in very good condition. Crew were as friendly as can be with smiles and helpfulness all the way. A complimentary sandwich was served on the flight with free hot and cold drinks a turkey tandoori sandwich which was very nice then a salad tomato and cheese roll on the way back which was less appetising. Chocolates were offered on descent which was a lovely and very tasty surprise. Bang on time friendly flight deck announcements and aircraft cameras which showed views from the nose gear on take off and landing. Various programmes were shown without audio on the hanging TVs.

There were only 8 or 9 blankets on board and I think I got the only pillow by asking about them during boarding. The food on this leg was nice and the staff okay. From Helsinki to London the staff were friendly and active but the food was very plain. A tiny bun with cheese. Economy passengers have to pay 3 euros for a newspaper which is daylight robbery.

We were a family of 4 and had 4 pieces with only 65 kg of luggage. However we had to re-pack that it was a small but long box with sharp items which are not allowed for carry-on luggage. In the end we could re-pack with help (and money) of luggage packers at the airport which took us nearly 1 hour. In addition to this unfriendly treatment during check-in the flight from PVG to Helsinki was also very unpleasant. The aircraft was an old A340-300 with old IFE and very small screens. The worst was the food: 1st course: meat balls with noodles - consistency was terrible taste horrible. Before landing in Helsinki a ""Lasagne"" was served which was also not edible.

The lounge Finnair uses at Bangkok is very poor a limited selection of bad food and uncomfortable chairs. However after this the experience was far better. The plane departed promptly and we therefore arrived early in Helsinki. Seat was looking a bit tired but I didn't find it uncomfortable. TV controls lights etc. all seemed to work fine and I found the entertainment selection very good. Food was edible though not outstanding. That said there was certainly a lot of it.

Non vegetarian food was unavailable when the food trolley reached us both for the onward and return journey and the staff seemed very nonchalant about it.

Unfortunately the same system controls the power to the seat so for 1/3 of the flight (3 hours) I could not alter my seat position. When it eventually started working I discovered the seat was one of the old angled designs which was dreadfully uncomfortable to sleep on. The movie selection on the VOD system when it eventually worked was pretty poor - most of the movies were years old ""classics"" and I'd seen them all before. There was no power at the seat for my laptop for the entire flight. The food was mediocre - they seem to fous on quantity over quality there was little choice (a choice of three rice dishes) the food arrived still in its foil. The worst thing about this trip was the worst seat I have ever tried to sleep on (even worse than the concrete Lufthansa J-class seats) combined with poorly timed flights (departs afternoon lands 11pm UK time / 7am China time).

Finnair customer review,10,2013-08-05,LHR-HEL Airbus 320 European Business Class flight. First leg of a longer trip. However I was pleasantly surprised. Cabin was clean and fairly comfortable although I do maintain it is a bit of a cheek to call a seat Business Class when it is just in fact an Economy seat with the adjacent seat left free. However most European airlines do this now and Finnair is no exception. Cabin Crew however was very good and the food and drink offerings better than what I had experienced previously on British Airways' Club Europe service. Finnair uses Cathay Pacific's lounge at Heathrow which apart from the good views of the runway was nothing special. Finnair's own lounge at Helsinki was more impressive with some interesting design aspects and plenty of comfortable seating.

In fact I think I have had better inflight entertainment on board the flight from Malaga to Berlin on Air Berlin a mere 3 hour flight.

The leg room on the economy seat can only be classed as a joke. When the man in front of me attempted to put his seat back it caused me pain. He kindly put the seat upright. The box under the seat in front also does not allow for legs to sit straight causing stress on hips and ankles. Without doubt this cabin set up is the worst of any airline currently flying the seats have obviously been pushed closer together in an attempt to fit in as many people as possible.

They informed us that our carry-on suitcase that met all of the carry-on requirements could not be taken as a carry-on and must be checked. Given that we had one carry-on between 2 people this hardly seemed fair. Flight was like any other cheap charter - no leg room and limited service. Flight from Copenhagen was similar but the check-in process was worse - they open the check-in 2 hours prior to boarding and we made it to the gate with minutes to spare.

The food was mediocre and there was no dine-on-demand service. The crew seemed bothered and at times even amused when you pressed the call button and asked for pretty basic things like a refill. No amenity kit provided. When asked for a comb and a toothbrush the cabin crew again seemed more annoyed than helpful and after a 'quick checking' told me that there were none onboard. What more can you say?,False,,,Business Class,,,2,2,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,2,,,False
Finnair customer review,10,2013-05-07,LHR-TKU. Both legs had quick layovers in HEL but they worked fine. Because of the Schengen rules the distance from the connecting international (non Schengen) to domestic flights at Vantaa is quite significant but everything worked ok for me. The domestic flights are on the old finncomm planes and you need to get a bus to them on the other side of the tarmac but everything is very efficient and organised and hard to fault. Otherwise after 8 tortuous months of flying on low cost airlines flying Finnair was excellent. Friendly staff. Free coffee and water. Sandwich was quite tasty. You even get hot towels. Both international flights had extra legroom.. quick and easy check in (online) and you don't have to worry about any extra fees. Would not hesitate to fly with Finnair again if the price is ok.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,,True
Finnair customer review,,2013-05-06,Hong Kong to Helsinki in business class on A340. Dinner service was very slow. It took more than an hour before service even started. There were not enough staff to serve drinks and food together and refill of drinks were not offered until dinner was over. Most airlines give you some toiletries in business class but there was nothing like that on this flight. The lavatories had soap but that was it. No lotion toothbrushes or any other essentials. Like many reviewers said plane was old and tarnished. Seats are not flat in business; and still the seats were the best part of this flight.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,1,,,1,,,False
Finnair customer review,4,2013-05-04,Helsinki to Hong Kong. The plane was old seats were cramped worse than you expect on a long haul flight.

Finnair customer review,6,2013-05-01,SIN-HEL Seat 55A (2x4x2) on an A340. Plane was old and looked very tired. Seat was fair not as much room as others I have flown on. Supposedly 32 inch pitch on the Finnair A340 - maybe on their newer planes. Service was average one attendant was friendly and smiled - an older lady behaved as though she hated her job was outwardly rude. IFE was quite poor extremely old. Food was nice and beer was cold.

Finnair customer review,9,2013-04-21,Amsterdam-Helsinki-Bangkok Business. Finnair get pretty mixed reviews so I was pleasantly surprised by my recent trip. The 2 hour flight Amsterdam-Helsinki was standard with the centre seat blocked but there were only 4 of us in Business so the service was attentive with very chatty crew. Lunch was hot and reasonably tasty and plenty of drinks. Helsinki airport was really busy but the lounge was peaceful if busy. A very limited range of food but enough and good showers. A330 to Bangkok was new looking and very clean. With only 5 people in Business I had plenty of choice of seats. The seat converted to a fully flat bed with decent sized pillows and nice thick duvet. Choice of TV and films wasn't huge but enough. The food was really good and tasty if simple. Again the cabin crew were very professional and friendly.,False,,,Business Class,,,5,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,,True
Finnair customer review,,2013-04-18,Three of us bought tickets from Finnair. Our connecting flight was late about 10 minutes on arrival to Frankfurt leaving us only 50 minutes between flights. We rushed from one terminal to another passing security and passport control. We were at the gate about 2-3 minutes after closing while plane was still at the gate and connected by the tunnel. Of course they couldn't let us on board. We explained the situation later at the counter desk but we got reply that 45 minutes is enough and we had 50 between flights so they just cancelled our tickets including return tickets and asked 750 EUR to put us to the later flight that day only to get to Helsinki.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,1,,,False
Finnair customer review,2,2013-03-22,LHR-HEL-HEL-LHR. Quite shocked at the decline in services with this airline. Flights were on time. Dismayed at time of booking asked to pay for seats yet no good seats available. When checking in online all front economy rows had available seats for free. Nothing is free any more with this airline. No newspapers of course no free alcoholic drinks anymore either. The crew seemed a little indifferent and resigned to half service. On way out no announcements from the captain which was odd. On return had to fight for my seat as the airline had moved me from my chosen seat on row 6 to row 18! Only after much arguing was I reinstated to row 5. Food was ok way out (a sandwich) but bizarre on way back - something called chicken curry salad - no sauce so very dry! Not impressed even at low fare.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,,False
Finnair customer review,10,2013-03-20,BKK-HEL-GVA-HEL-BKK in Business Class. Excellent flights in all respects especially the wonderful service food and wines and clean cabins. FAs extremely gracious and elegant and make a point of keeping eye contact. Helsinki Vantaa remarkably efficient for quick transfers and a major improvement over past years. Return GVA-HEL sector was operated by Flybe and apart from a tight squeeze in the small business cabin was also fine.

Finnair customer review,5,2013-03-20,HEL-LPA-HEL. B752 is to be avoided even for 6hrs flight. Poor legroom old cabin and poor seat cushion results back ache. Catering poor. Crew ok and attentive for selling goods and refreshments. What they have improved now they don't aggressively demand passengers separate waste at table tray to make job easier for crew. Both flights were ahead of schedule luggage came in 30min which is also a slight improvement for Finnair flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,,False
Finnair customer review,,2013-03-20,Helsinki to Funchal Madeira and back. Aircraft seemed old and shabby. The crew very insistently coaxed us to change seats to get more leg room for my boyfriend yet in the new seats the leg room wasn't any better and we had to sit on either side of the aisle. Cold condensation water fell on me several times during the flight very unpleasant. On the return flight my shoes were ruined because of a used bubble gum that stuck to them apparently from under another seat.

IFE broke down but was given a Finnair shop voucher. Flight smooth cabin clean quiet and seat comfortable. HEL-VIE-HEL on A319's. HEL-SIN was a much newer A340 (OH-LQD). All flights on time.

Finnair customer review,10,2013-03-14,HEL-DEL-HEL on A330-300 in March 2013. Finnair has improved: both flights ahead of schedule tasty and filling meals with an Indian vegetarian meal option both ways good selection of IFE for a short flight (5 hrs 50 mins) on the way to Delhi and the fact that the plane leaves 10.45am on the way back to Helsinki (7 hrs) instead of midnight makes a big difference.

Inbound flight from HEL was delayed meaning a 45 min connection to LHR wouldn't be possible. Finnair simply rebooked us on a later BA flight meaning a 60min extra in HEL.

Finnair customer review,5,2013-01-22,Just returned to Australia after flights booked through Finnair. Overall not really impressed with the service. A change in our itinerary was our first upset-we never really got an explanation as to why. On our outward flight we sat on the plane for an hour whilst baggage was being loaded. The aircon wasn't functioning so we sat sweating for an hour. Cabin service was quite poor just above a budget airline standard. We asked if we might have a drink and were brushed off and remained thirsty. During long legs the flight attendants were rarely seen outside of meal service.

Told the next 2 flights were fully booked and that my only recourse was to buy another ticket. My husband and I have travelled domestically and internationally and experienced problems.

Barely made our connecting flight with another airline from Bangkok. Flight back was slightly delayed due to strong headwind but once again we just managed to catch our connecting flight. Seats on this new A330 were very comfortable. The service was OK with average food.

The food served in economy was inedible both to and from Bangkok breakfast was served on Cathay flight from Hong Kong to Bangkok. In order to select a normal seat in economy Finnair charges €56 it is not fair with a non budget airline they only serve one alcoholic beverage with the first meal.

Check in transfer at Helsinki and baggage collection was fast since it was business class. Standard seats from LHR to HEL with the middle seat vacant. Fully flat seat from HEL to DEL (Airbus A330). Business lounge at Helsinki is very spacious. I must say the cost and staff service was good but the real problem was with the food and entertainment. In business class you expect better quality food. Though I had pre-ordered vegetarian food it was not up to the mark. I think rather than quality they give more stress on quantity.

The terminal is full of families the delay has produced a couple of blankets 3 security guards and 8 euros a passenger.

The service was generally good. The transit in Helsinki was a breeze and I was off to Paris.

Finnair customer review,4,2012-10-30,As a Finn I have to regret that our national carrier is not quite as it used to be. It is less reliable with increasingly frequent delays. No consistency in service quality anymore. Some connections are significantly worse than others. My recent flights between Beijing and Helsinki and Hong Kong and Helsinki both economy and business indicated major differences between the two routes to China. The Beijing route is no frills in an old and run down jet whereas the Hong Kong one has more recent equipment. The former had completely dysfunctional entertainment system with tiny blurred screens for example and no flight information (time distances etc.) but a single picture placing the plane over Asia. The poor staff were constantly asked about time by the passengers. Both flights had poor meals in the economy and the Hong Kong one excellent ones in the business.

Seats were bearable the old lie flat type but after 20minutes we were told that the entire entertainment system didn't work and were offered an insulting EUR 20 voucher. For a flight of 12 hours this was totally unacceptable and the second time the system hasn't worked on the same plane (May 2012). Finnair please address this.

Finnair customer review,5,2012-10-22,DEL-HEL-HEL. October 2012. Finnair uses leased A340s from Air France on this sector and it is very visible with the blue tray table and leg rests. Efficient check in and boarding. Finnair is strict on weight of cabin baggage - they actually checked it. During the Delhi - Helsinki flight an additional round of drinks were served between the two meals which was welcome. Crew seemed friendly and efficient but not as warm as other airlines. Quality of food was very low - greasy and small in quantity probably because Finnair sells snacks in between meals. Return flight of six hours in the night was packed and crew did 4 hours of service for dinner and breakfast interspersed with announcements so ensured passengers did not get sleep. Cabin lights were not dimmed prior to take off and during landing. Average airline and not the best.

The food and wine was excellent my special meal came individually labelled with no glitches on all four sectors and the cabins were fresh and comfortable. Transfers at Helsinki were fast and efficient. The A330 from Delhi to Helsinki offered flat beds albeit with a rather strange layout that seems to be unique to Finnair - two seats in one row and one seat in the row behind with footwells extending quite deeply. The seats turn into flat beds which are tolerably comfortable but there is a distinct feeling of being cramped. At 5'10"" my feet were running up against the end of the footwell. The A320s to and from London had the standard European seating pretty much three-across economy class seats with limited legroom but with the middle seat left free. Three hours from Helsinki to London in those seats was tiring to be frank. The A340 back from Helsinki to Delhi had clearly older seats which turned into inclined beds (in a 2-2-2 layout).

Seats were the standard Embraer 190 economy seats so substandard for business class. Only one row for Business Passengers from Helsinki - Warsaw so felt cramped in section. Light snack and drinks on first sector. Hot meal on second sector and was quite tasty. Travel part of a longer route so quite good value. Business class poor value if travelling only between the city pairs.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,5,,,4,,,True

Finnair customer review,8,2012-09-11,Just arrived on AY 070 from HGK in to HEL and am just enjoying the Finnair Lounge in Helsinki before my onwards journey to Hamburg. Was seated in AY's business class cabin in seat 4H on A343. Plane on the in and outside spotless and the business class cabin in immaculate condition. Well presented looking cabin crew took excellent care of us in a packed business class cabin without being obtrusive. Skipped dinner as flight leaves HKG shortly after midnight and had a filling meal in the CX lounge in HKG. Breakfast a bit bland but sufficient. If AY could just upgrade their A343 business class seats to full flat beds. Arrived in to HEL 30 minutes early and transit clearance a breeze.

Finnair customer review,8,2012-09-11,I took the afternoon flight from Helsinki to Warsaw on the 10th of September. The check in agent was kind and did her job well. The same kindness was shown from the lady who handled the departure gate alone. She was generous and offered me another seat where I was able to have the whole row alone. The onboard service was good and crew smiled a lot. There were a lot of verbal interaction between cabin crew and passengers. The announcements from technical crew were loud and clear.

Finnair customer review,1,2012-08-23,SIN - HEL. Flight departure was delayed according to ticketed departure time. Entertainment system did not work nor did overhead lights. Seat offered no support and was uncomfortable after 10 minutes. Row spacing meant that it was not possible to stretch legs out under the seat in front. Consequently it was difficult to get any sleep on the overnight flight. Hand basin taps in toilets did not work for most of the flight.

Finnair customer review,9,2012-08-22,MAN-HEL-HKG. Finnair has adopted a 'budget' approach to food and drinks on European flights but there was a complimentary food pack (biscuits crisps and tea) on the MAN-HEL journey. Flew out to Helsinki on a good day - early arrival few travellers extremely smooth transfer. Embraer 190 is perfect - quiet cabin. HEL-HKG journey was decent. Food could be a bit more delicious (per personal taste) and the available choices of music could be more varied. Two things that I have long missed as a traveller in our cost-cutting aviation industry: spacious washrooms and warm comfortable cabin temperature. I found both on Finnair. It seems to me they are cutting costs without losing their customer-oriented attitudes - also to mention the friendly courteous crew members.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,,True
Finnair customer review,5,2012-08-16,LON-HEL-SVX. Flew Finnair a couple of years ago on the same route and I am sorry to say that the quality has dropped even further. No inflight entertainment or anything to help keep the kids occupied. I asked if they had any children activities and was told they didn't do it anymore. The quality of the food is poor for the price I paid I don't think a cold chicken curry sandwich is acceptable. You can of course get nicer food but you have to pay for it. Inflight service on the Helsinki legs was inadequate. I needed to get some water for my boys and my call light was ignored when I finally asked I was told to wait until the trolley came through. The plane only had 2 toilets and when my oldest boy needed the toilet there was a long queue my wife asked to use the business class toilet and after several curt refusals he allowed to use the toilet. There was a general feeling of a lack of care from the IFA's on the flights as if we were annoying them by being on the plane. Service on the Helsinki - Ekaterinburg legs was better but no more than adequate and nowhere near the high standards I was expecting. Finnair is taking on a lot of elements of budget airlines in its ethos and this is starting to filter through with poor in flight service and really poor food.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,,False
Finnair customer review,3,2012-08-16,Helsinki (HEL) to Toronto (YYZ). The route is flown by a B752 aircraft in leisure configuration.

Finnair customer review,5,2012-08-09,YYZ-HEL-ARN-HEL-YYZ. Boeing 757-200 between Toronto-Helsinki. I am aware that other airlines also use these smaller Boeings for equivalent routes between these smaller European capitals and US. It was first time I flew this type of aircraft on a transatlantic flight. I found it to be small packed and the fact that there was barely any inflight entertainment system on board didn't maker the 8-9 hr flight between Toronto and Helsinki any better. The flight itself was however very smooth and Helsinki airport is excellent for someone who likes quick and efficient transfers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,,False
Finnair customer review,2,2012-08-08,HEL-SIN in July 2012 was a terrible experience. Delayed 2hrs where we sat inside the plane waiting. Then the seat didn't hold it looked old. The screen was scratched and tiny. Many times the films didn't work properly. Next the food came really late and it was horrible - served with plastic utensils.

Finnair customer review,10,2012-08-08,Flew from Tallinn to Berlin over Helsinki-Vantaa last fall which was my very first experience with Finnair.

Finnair customer review,7,2012-08-07,HEL-SIN-HEL on A340 in June-July 2012. Haven't flown with them for 4 years because competitors have been cheaper on long haul. Flights packed to the last seat but both flights on time two hot meals served on this 11-12 hr flight pleasant and adequate service by a Finnish-Chinese-Malay cabin crew and the IFE worked well on both flights. However there is room for improvement on this 4-star airline: Meals from Helsinki Airport flight kitchen are bland and cheap quite the opposite on the SIN-HEL leg with tasty chicken or beef plus a proper hot breakfast IFE is too limited. A wider range of newer films are needed. No overnight pack (socks etc) which is a standard on many airlines. The price was right this time and we felt it was good value. Moreover their new uniforms are quite classy. When the price is right Finnair will be considered again although they are clearly behind many other 4-star airlines (LH TG TK etc.).,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,9,2012-08-06,BKK-HEL-BCL-HEL-BKK in business class. A330 business cabin BKK-HEL was spacious and the bedding comfortable. Quilts provided are not your typical itchy wool type quilts. Flights generally on time. Baggage allowance of 2 pieces up to 23kg each was favourable. 10 hour long haul flight was comfortable and service attentive. Requests for further drinks were met with a polite smile and efficiency. Self service area in the galley had enough treats. IFE on the long haul product is not as fancy as that on other carriers but had ample selection for the relatively short long haul sectors. A320 product within Europe includes business with a 3/3 layout with the middle seat kept empty. Drinks a plenty on this service as well and champagne served when the BCL takeoff was delayed by 20 minutes. Staff attentive and friendly. Overall a pleasant experience.

Finnair customer review,8,2012-07-22,Prague to Helsinki return connecting further onto domestic flights. Finnair still provides a very decent service on its European routes even though they've not been immune to aggressive cost cutting which has affected the service somewhat. Asking 8 € for a pre-assigned seat is shameful but if you're patient you can choose your seat freely (even exit row!) during online check-in. On the upside flights were on time (even despite some delay on departure) and legroom on the A320 family is good. Water soft drinks and tea/coffee are offered free of charge there's food (cold but very tasty) even on a 2 hr. flight; and the overhead screens show live take-off/approach footage. Staff are delightful.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,,True
Finnair customer review,9,2012-07-22,We flew last week from Helsinki to Hamburg in Business. The Finnair Lounge is always nice but quite crowded as it's the only one for the schengen flights. But you could tell it's July and holiday season as quite empty. Buffet good and tasty. Onboard the Embraer 190 is quite small but service was really good. Was surprised to see that no menu cards were offered. Would have been nice to know what we were eating. No starter as well. The main course was quite tasty and the dessert but was very small.

Took the option of extra leg room on both flights (both night flights) - row 41 and was glad I did as I managed a reasonable sleep.

Finally around 11.30ish a few passengers went over to the Finnair Lounge only to find that the flight had been delayed. The previous plane hadn't come in - you didn't know this before letting half the plane check in? Many people had been there since 8.30-9pm!

Finnair customer review,5,2012-06-21,We had travelled 7hrs by car to get to Toronto on the 5th and spent the whole day of the 6th waiting for our flight to go out at 10.30 pm and then we were told the flight was cancelled. Finnair did pay for our hotel that night and paid for our breakfast but then we had another day of waiting around and which cost us money for more meals. Because of this delay we missed a day and a half in Copenhagen which was part of our trip that we had paid for. We feel we lost about four hundred dollars a person for the delay. The plane was like a sardine can. There was no leg room and very hard getting in and out of your seat. Anybody with claustrophobia would not have been able to handle it. The flight attendants were very pleasant and friendly. I can't complain about the service at all. Our flight from Copenhagen to Helsinki was in a much roomier plane.

Rebooking agent was rude. Worse I know these cancellations are a matter of routine - same happened to two relatives in May.

Finnair customer review,8,2012-05-22,Bangkok-Helsinki A330-200. A fairly new aircraft and I was impressed with the appearance of the cabin. Nice and cool pale blue layout which was spotlessly clean. I found the seating very comfortable with ample leg room and didn't feel closed in when the pax in front reclined. Cabin crew were not overly chatty but professional and attentive constantly offering water and keeping the toilets clean. Entertainment worked well but found the choices a bit limited. After the first meal service any additional alcoholic drinks and snacks are charged. The second meal was complimentary but again alcohol is charged. The food was basic nothing to look forward to very salty. I will take this flight again as the comfort Finnair provides over others is far better plus it's a daylight flight to Europe. Transit in Helsinki was 1 hr 55 and I was pushing to make my next flight. Helsinki-Berlin 737 aircraft looked a bit tired inside and seating was cramped.

Cabin crew polite and helpful but smiles not abundant. Food dreadful. My main complaint is the over-ambitious scheduling of connections. ICN-HEL-MAN with a 2-hour layover is great in theory but one minor delay torpedoes the whole thing. Rebooking HEL-LHR-MAN on BA wasn't a disaster but it cost me 6 hours.

Finnair customer review,8,2012-04-03,Four long-haul business class flights in 2 months to BKK and HKG from London with a connection in Helsinki were generally favourable. Time keeping is good and transfers in Helsinki are smooth. Business class cabins are smart and very well maintained toilets are kept clean and presentable. One out of 4 flights (to BKK) had seats that converted to fully-flat beds while the other 3 were the less comfortable angled lie-flat ones. Seat cushioning seems thin and on the hard side.

Finnair customer review,6,2012-03-29,We (2 of us) flew economy from Brussels to Helsinki Helsinki to Kittilä return. Onboard staff friendly the seats comfortable with a little more leg-room than usual. However food was lousy! I reserved seats in advance for the return from Helsinki to Brussels.

Finnair customer review,1,2012-03-29,SIN-HEL-SIN. Flight to HEL was empty which made me even more curious about the lack of service the flight form HEL was oversold 2 hours late arriving at the gate and then went on a 3 hour mechanical problem. Finnair's shabby A340 was in appalling condition. Broken IFE armrest tray table and dirty seat both directions but in different seats. Aircraft was too warm no air vents and the floor was dirty - both directions. Cabin crew socially awkward brisk and unfriendly.

Finnair customer review,1,2012-03-13,"Flew CDG-HEL. Finnair has a code share with AF and operates the flight instead of AF. The crew was very cold and distant. During this 3hr flight they served a tiny sandwich. Most of all they now charge 5euros for wine.

Finnair customer review,2,2012-02-21,A dreadful experience flying Helsinki to Dubai. Leg room on 757 aircraft only suited for a 5 ft tall person. It seems they took out toilets and added extra rows of seats. It was impossible to make your way to the toilets as the hostesses were too busy selling duty free products in the aisle and the queues were much too long.

Finnair customer review,9,2012-02-09,SIN-HEL-HAM return DUS-HEL-HKG in business class. Am a big fan of the unobtrusive service flight attendants offered on all flights. As OW Emerald got first food choice on both long haul flights and on the short European flight was sole customer in business class. Slept well on angled seat and did not use AY AVOD as I had an iPad. All flights on time except HEL-HKG - delayed 12 hours but was very well handled. Busses took us to terminal and all business class passengers were escorted to the taxi rank and taken to a hotel.

Finnair customer review,7,2012-02-08,LHR-HEL-BKK and SIN-HEL-LHR in Dec-Feb. Service was good staff language skills outstanding. IFE is poor in comparison to other major carriers. A330 has lie flat seats but if travelling as a couple avoid the left hand seats as there is less room than in the middle paired seats. A340 on return was awful for sleeping: the low back shell design means limited space in footwells and the seat does not go flat. I'm 5ft 8 and could not fit into the space to lie down. European leg was economy seat with middle seat vacant. We'd booked flights to Australia so the onward connections were with Qantas (on Finnair codeshare) who have great seats and lounges.

Finnair customer review,7,2012-01-09,Economy class round trip ARN-HEL-KIX. Pleasant trip with an easy connection in Helsinki. The aircraft seemed new and the entertainment system excellent.

Finnair customer review,7,2012-01-09,LHR-HEL-BKK return in business class. European sector economy seats are three across with the middle seat blocked off. Dinner and drinks served soon after take-off from London early evening. The meal looked attractive and tasted good. Departure of Bangkok flight is scheduled 55 mins after the London flight arrives. 20 mins after landing I was in my seat for Bangkok. A330-300 business class cabin on the outbound flight a muted grey colour seating is 1-2-1. Each seat has a generous side table seats are on the narrow side and a broad shouldered person might not be comfortable. The fully flat bed is welcome but seat padding not generous. The duvet is thick so folded several times provided a comfortable base for sleeping. The meal was adequate but not outstanding. I did not use the inflight entertainment except to display the map. The return flight seating configuration was 2-2-2 across. It boarded on time but departure delayed 45 mins. The seats again had limited padding and provided only an angled lie-flat bed. Sleeping was uncomfortable. Cabin crew were attentive and friendly. In Helsinki the Finnair Lounge is underwhelming. The food selection was uninteresting there was a cash bar for everything except soft drinks and a small wine and beer selection but Wi-Fi was free and the showers excellent. The flight to London left on time. We were seated three across in regular economy seats in front of the dividing curtain. Not the expected ending to an otherwise good service.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,5,,,4,,,True

Finnair customer review,6,2011-12-21,OSL-HEL-HKG return. Catering seems to be worse than it used to be. It's like an upgraded economy meal. Wines were ok but had to ask for refills. My main complaint is the lack of sleeping comfort in these angled seats. It's worse than anything else I have tried. Finnair should offer flat beds to HKG when they offer it on the BKK route which is more of a leisure destination than HKG. AY were actually more expensive than both SAS Lufthansa and CX so I feel that this was not good value for money. I will travel with AY again when they have installed flat beds throughout their entire long haul fleet. Until then I will stick to CX OZ and TG.,False,,,Business Class,,,2,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,,False

Finnair customer review,1,2011-12-13,YYZ-HEL-WAW. The 757 they fly to Toronto should have been sent to the junk yard a long time ago. It is incredible they are using these aircraft on transatlantic routes. Very little leg room. Very small overhead bins. The flight HEL-WAW-HEL a completely different story. New aircraft. Started to board early to allow everybody lots of time to settle down. I liked that a lot. Good service. YYZ-HEL service was good too but this aircraft just spoiled it all.

Coming back two of us were directed to Los Angeles instead of Chicago spent 1 hr fixing that problem then they separated us to 2 different planes. We found out that instead of 1 stop in Helsinki we will have to stop in New York and there will be 6 hrs wait. So instead of regular 12 hrs trip we had 18 hrs trip and almost no food.

Finnair customer review,8,2011-10-21,Singapore to Helsinki on a lie flat seat less room and a bit hard to get to sleep on as you keep sliding down towards the end compared to Qantas A380. Nice pillow and duvet though. Food reasonable and a nice touch being able to access the menu online before the flight and make your selection. Flight attendants very friendly and would give other airlines a run for their money. Helsinki-London are all economy seats however business class have the middle seat of 3 blocked out giving you a bit of extra room. Nice lounge in Helsinki. Return flight delayed out of Heathrow due to fog and with only 40 minutes between the arrival from London and next leg to Singapore. This was a bit of a worry but in the end it was not a problem as the Singapore leg waited for passengers from London to arrive. Didn't use the AVOD.

Finnair customer review,9,2011-10-14,BKK-HEL return. Flights punctual. New business class product outstanding - full flatbed seat with a lot space around it plus aisle access for all even window seats without a herringbone layout. Crew very pleasant and attentive. My only reservations were the seat cushions which I found too firm and the AVOD selection which was rather restrictive - not as good as economy on the best carriers. On the return leg I did not have time for the buffet dinner in the lounge but it did not appear to be very extensive. On the basis of other reports I had expect only a light meal on the plane but in fact a full dinner was served.,False,,,Business Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,,True

Finnair customer review,6,2011-09-29,LHR-SIN via HEL. A journey of 2 halves. Arrived early and used Cathay First lounge as Gold BA. First leg to HEL was on 320 with good meal and service transfer on arrival easy and lounge impressive although you have to ask for alcoholic drinks. Also offered free use of the Spa which was good. Boarding the SIN leg was painless and service onboard old style but First Class. A340 had the lie flat beds which are okay but they really need their new product on this route. The return was chaotic late boarding and poor service. The IFE had to be reset which meant passengers in Business Class could not recline their seat for 30 mins.

Finnair customer review,6,2011-09-15,HKG-HEL-HKG on the A340. Food and service were adequate and the seats comfortable by day. But they are not flat beds and only reach an angle of about 15 degrees making them very uncomfortable for sleeping.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,,False

HEL-BKK was excellent modern planes with good service. Only gripe was the lighting from Bangkok we flew out at night and they wouldn't dim the lights which was frustrating.

Finnair customer review,1,2011-08-31,Helsinki-Toronto with a rather old single aisle 757 which are designed for holiday destinations.

Finnair customer review,8,2011-08-29,JFK-Beijing return with stopovers. Food was good for myself and my kids my wife did not like it. Service in general was good except for one incident going to China. As we were nearing Helsinki people in other windows seats opened their windows letting in the sun.

Economy class seats comfortable if slightly cramped. Plane interiors painted in very attractive shades of blue. Inflight entertainment screens available with very good flight map graphics. Frequent updates from the pilot kept us well informed. Flight attendants were helpful and not too obtrusive. Online check-in process and the boarding of planes was reasonably smooth though it was not clear during the boarding process which rows were actually supposed to be boarding at any given moment.

Finnair customer review,7,2011-08-03,VIE-HEL-TAL return. On-board service is definitely above average on the Vienna-Helsinki flight all the announcements and instructions were made in 4 languages and the catering was also suitable. On the other hand the price reflects it and you cannot feel comfortable when your flight is 1.5 hrs late and you miss your connecting flight. But I got a reasonable accommodation and arriving to Tallinn late morning instead of late night was no problem for me.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,8,2011-07-28,HEL-MUC return. Hadn't flown Finnair short haul for a while and was pleasantly surprised. Pushed back early on the outbound flight and only a short wait before takeoff despite morning rush hour at HEL. Standard chicken sandwich offered with rounds of coffee and soft drinks. Adequate for a short flight - the taste was quite good they've apparently responded to the critique. Seating in A319 Economy is sufficient for a short run. On the inbound leg a sandwich again very nice in taste. Had a few drinks I think 5€ is a reasonable price for them. E190 seating is ok the seats are a little hard though. A lovely older purser very service-minded and smiling. All in all a pleasant change from a few years back. No frills but gets the job done. An ok alternative intra-Europe depending on the fare.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,7,2011-07-27,BKK-HEL-DUS-HEL-HKG after connecting from/to SYD with Qantas. Long-haul new planes (A330/ A340) in excellent condition. In Europe A319 and E70 slightly older but no problem. Long-haul the entertainment system was okay providing an acceptable size for in-seat screens but with a somewhat limited selection. Headphones were inadequate. Service level without issues if a bit on the colder side. Meal sizes smallish but sufficient. It was disappointing to see that breakfast on the Helsinki-Hong Kong sector only contained a small bread roll which was not sufficient at the end of a 9 hr+ flight. We were told that additional snacks could be purchased. Legroom no problem for 180 cms not overly generous but I have experienced a lot worse. In Europe catering below-average especially in terms of size. IFE through overhead monitor but no drama on relatively short (2 hours) flights. Due to status I could make use of Finnair's lounge in Helsinki and the lounge is very well-presented. The detour via Helsinki is not as time-consuming as one might think so avoiding LHR or FRA to connect to other destinations Helsinki is a great transit airport. Overall good value for money and acceptable service but nothing spectacular.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,8,2011-07-20,Zurich-Helsinki one way on A320 Business Class. The Business Class seats were the same as in Economy but the middle seat was blocked. The seat was a bit hard but ok for a 2hr 20min flight. No meal choices but a tasty hot meal was offered with a wide selection of drinks. Finnish and international newspapers available. Attentive service and the crew gave a professional image. The lounge they use at ZRH is rather modest and does not really match the rest of the product.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,9,2011-07-20,HEL-HKG on an Airbus A340 which was new and in good condition. The flight departed and arrived on time. The Business Class lounge in Helsinki is almost new and amongst the best in the world. The angled flat beds on this overnight flight were very roomy but a little hard after a few hours. I managed to get about 5hrs sleep. The quality of the food was very good as was the wine which was freely available. The outstanding feature of this flight was the attentive and professional service. The flight attendants were mature experienced professionals who did not have the charm and warmth of some of the Asian attendants but provided a high level of service. I have used Finnair many times and have always felt confident that the more mature Finnair crew would handle any major problems far more capably than the young glamorous attendants on some of the highly rated airlines. In summary a great flight.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True

Finnair customer review,8,2011-07-20,Malaga (AGP) to Helsinki (HEL). Unfortunately the flight was delayed about 1.5hr due to some problems with one of the brakes on the aircraft. The crew however was very professional and offered candies and water to all the passengers while waiting they also showed a Disney cartoon while we were still waiting on the ground. When we were in the air the food service started very quickly and went by very smoothly. The meal was a sandwich which actually was just enough for a night flight. Drinks were complimentary. The only thing that I can complain about is that the cabin was very worn including the toilet. It felt quite dirty and shabby for example the armrests were very loose. But still the crew were very professional.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,5,2011-07-17,Toronto-Helsinki-Milan return. Starting off with my flights to and from Milan they were fine. Went off without a hitch. Service was fine no complaints but I did find the one skimpy little sandwich they fed you for that 2.5 hr flight was pretty mediocre. My flights from and back to Toronto were another story though. It wasn't the service that got me but the type of airplane they used (a Boeing 757). The 757's are meant for short to medium-haul flights so why they use it for a long-haul 8.5hr flight is beyond me. It had next to no entertainment leg room seat width or seat recline. It was like being a sardine. So my advice: for European domestic Finnair is perfectly fine. For specifically Toronto-Helsinki though don't fly Finnair unless they change the aircraft used. You would be far better off flying indirect with another airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,False
Finnair customer review,8,2011-07-15,SYD-BKK (BA)-HEL-LHR-HEL-SIN-SYD (QF) in J class. AY has not yet let me down another enjoyable trip with Finnair. Angled flat beds for BKK-HEL and HEL-SIN legs somehow I missed full flat bed with the new aircraft for both legs. Cabin crews are professional friendly and helpful for all flights. Food was great and well presented. On LHR-HEL flight  Bulgugi (Korean BBQ beef) was served very interesting trip for European flight. The highlight of my trip was the new Spa at HEL airport it was amazing and definitely push the airport lounge experience to the new level. 4 saunas (Finnish sauna steam sauna stone bath and brechel bath) and mineral spa pool are available. The new lounge is so modern and well designed lighting is fantastic. AY is still my choice for European flights.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,8,2011-07-13,Helsinki-Singapore return. Flights were on time return flight slightly ahead of schedule. Plane was a new and clean Airbus A340 and the crew was professional. Dinner was ok breakfast was good. The personal in-flight entertainment is modern but could have a bit broader selection. Overall a pleasant experience both ways where everything went smoothly from check-in to arrival.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,10,2011-07-12,Changi-Helsinki-Heathrow on Finnair. Service superb everything on time and efficient. Meals adequate and more importantly alcohol served. Loved the exterior camera. Beautifully executed crosswind landing in a thunderstorm at Heathrow. At the same price point as any other European national carrier. Cannot fault.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,,2011-07-11,Australia-Denmark. The first part of out flight there was with Qantas and was quite pleasant. The second part was with Finnair and was highly disappointing and continues to be so. Our flight from HK to Helsinki was delayed. That is itself while annoying is not so much the issue but more of a concern was the lack of assistance provided by Finnair to rectify the situation. When we arrived in Helsinki no attempt was made to assist us with making it to our connecting Finnair flight to Copenhagen. Not only did we miss our connecting flight we were then scheduled onto an SAS flight but somehow Finnair misplaced our luggage and we were without luggage for more a couple of days. Allegedly however this was not finnair's responsibility but SAS's. Again Finnair fail to take any responsibility. At the point of writing this we are sitting at Helsinki airport. Our flight to Bangkok is currently due to depart in 15 mins. At this stage the only information airline staff can give us is that the flight might be delayed but that they will let us know in about half and hour. In addition we found the service on the flight appalling. My husband is currently sitting with his right leg elevated and swollen after an air steward banged him in the knee while returning the drinks carriage.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Finnair customer review,4,2011-07-10,"ZRH-HEL-OUL return. Left quite unimpressed. ""Meal"" on Intra-European flight consisted of a small sandwich. No free alcohol. Plane interior was in ok shape but strange smell on return flight HEL-ZRH. A stale bread roll and some small ravioli in a cold box isn't very impressive for a 2.5hr flight.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Finnair customer review,8,2011-07-10,Helsinki-Budapest check in went smoothly the flight was delayed 30 mins for some problems with gate computers so boarding passes were checked manually. Flight was full service was professional. Catering ok meatballs and potato salad. If compared with the price what we paid can not complain.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,8,2011-07-07,Bangkok-Helsinki-Riga (BKK-HEL-RIX) in Business Class. As many people mentioned here already the food looks like Economy Class catering it's served in one tray and doesn't look very attractive. Attendants are a little bit cold but otherwise professional. The rest was great clean cabin and toilets friendly pilot good lounge at Helsinki airport. Taking into account the price Finnair's Business Class is surely value for money. Second leg (Helsinki-Riga) was an Embraer 170 where Business Class seats are 99% equal to Economy (they are exactly the same just slightly more leg room) so actually doesn't make sense paying extra.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,7,2011-06-29,Flew Finnair HKG-HEL-BER after connecting from MEL on CX. Was overall impressed by Finnair. Very efficient ground staff. Cabin clean and A340 on first leg was fairly new. Cabin crew polite and attentive. Captain made flight and destination updates regularly which is always nice to hear. Food was average but sufficient. Seat pitch at 32 inch was a bit tight and IFE was not as extensive as Asian or Middle Eastern airlines. Overall a good airline with no extra frills. Good value for money considering the fare I paid.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,8,2011-06-19,LHR-HEL-BKK-HKG-LHR good value in J class. LHR-HEL half full cabin. Used CX lounge at LHR which was adequate. No boarding drinks. Once airborne efficient and friendly service nice light dinner. Onward flight to BKK on A330-200 with new business class layout. Beautiful cabin pastel blue and grey colours. Solo window seat great flat seat allowed for comfortable sleep. Cabin crew although on the mature side very efficient friendly and warm. Also had oriental FAs who were probably more friendly. Entertainment system although AVOD was under par in terms of choices still lagging from their SE Asian counterparts! Food tasty but lacking presentation and probably the wow factor you expect in a premium cabin. I would compare it to SQ or CX excellent economy class fare but on fancy plates. All served in one tray needless to say servings on the small side. Breakfast was good but in terms of presentation had the feel of a very good economy cabin presentation. Arrival into BKK on time and was able to use fast track service for immigration. HKG-HEL-LHR. Morning flight ex-HKG on A330 with older cabin. A bit disappointed but as it was a day flight was manageable. Not my favourite for sleeping though. Food much better than previous flight separate trays for starters main and desert. Nice crew extremely friendly and chatty Oriental FA. Great service on time arrival into HEL. An hr connection which felt eternal; that's how seamless and efficient this airport is not an ounce of stress to get the onward flight. HEL-LHR on time departure nice lunch great crew. All in all great experience. If new cabin can be guaranteed no doubt I'd fly them again.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,8,2011-06-16,LHR-HEL return. I've not flown Finnair for over 2 years since a bad experience of a trip to Japan when service was awful and food even worse. Something must have happened as this week the service and food on the short haul to HEL were fantastic. The attendants were very friendly and attentive. 3 drinks runs on both legs. They now charge for alcohol which might be a reason why they can afford better food now. LHR-HEL we had some very tasty sandwiches properly prepared with crust cut off etc. On HEL-LHR they served us tortellini with chicken and a salad which was rather good! Well done Finnair for getting back on track service wise. Shame about the alcohol I did not want any but would have been upset if they had charged for a beer on long haul! It just seems a bit mean.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,9,2011-06-15,DEL-HEL-VIE A330. New A330 with full flat seats. Food good crew professional. I missed my connection to VIE due to a storm in HEL (3h delay). Finnair rebooked me the same evening via Stockholm to Vienna (SK and OS) so I arrived only 4 hours behind schedule and didn't have to sleep in a Hotel in HEL.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,8,2011-06-15,VIE-HEL-SIN E90/A340. Delays because of storms in Vienna and 60 min connection in HEL was pending. Finnair offered a rebooking to Emirates if I would miss my connection in HEL. As the delay was only 30min and HEL confirmed to wait for me I took the planned flight. I made the 30min connection even the luggage did. A340 a bit old inside seats are not flat but okay for sleeping. Crew professional but not overly heartily. Food good wine selection very good.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,9,2011-06-14,LHR-HEL return on A321/A320. On time and efficient.

Long walk though from the gate at Helsinki with no travelators.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,5,2011-06-12,Bangkok to Helsinki A340. During the night trip my TV didn't work - I was given a Finnair duty free voucher of 20 euros. The food was okay but for anyone who can't handle spicy food would have been in for a shock. I felt sick during the flight and flight attendants were helpful. They gave me some soda and told the staff members to keep an eye out for me really nice. On this airline if you get a window seat and you are travelling as a couple you sit by yourselves which is great. We also had another flight Helsinki to London and food was really good. It was a small platter of salad pickles cheese and bread.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Finnair customer review,8,2011-06-08,MAN-HEL-MAN on time both ways clean cabin good leg room. 2 servings of drinks going 1 coming back. Chicken sandwich going chicken salad coming back. I flew with them 2 and a half years ago and alcohol was free but no more. Feels very greedy from their part. If you want to order vegetarian food you have to ring an expensive phone number to get it you can't order it at the same time you make the booking online really annoying. I didn't get my luggage until 3 days after arriving in Finland due to a strike so now have to go through a complaint procedure. I was told though that I may not get any compensation since the strike was illegal! Unbelievable! The help passengers got from the airport workers was very poor indeed. We had to help each other to get and fill in the lost luggage forms. The lady behind the desk said she's going home now in the middle of all the chaos and I think my form was the last one she took in. There were plenty of distressed passengers in front of her desk without any idea what to do. Absolutely appalling very bad service at the airport!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,8,2011-06-08,ARN-HEL-BMA. Cabin clean and FAs smiling and attentive. Flying back aircraft was E170 no boarding music and cabin not very spacious but adequate for 45 minute flight. FAs attentive on this flight as well. BMA is very efficient airport close to Stockholm city. I hope Finnair will keep this route.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,8,2011-06-08,GVA-HEL-BKK J Class 3hr flight in small E70 cabin a bit on the limit seats like in Y and free neighbour seat doesn't seem to be guaranteed. Service good food mediocre. HEL-BKK excellent seating comfort in the new A330 flat beds single seat on the window. Excellent service and pre-ordered gourmet meal excellent (only ex HEL possible). Food on flight back not of same quality a bit average. Smooth connecting in Helsinki airport.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,4,2011-06-01,WAW-HEL-NRT with A340. I have been flying with Finnair on this route for years as for me it is the fastest connection from Europe to Japan. However my current trip had more cons than pros. I have observed a gradual falloff in quality of catering during years. Now they reach the point that you should take on your own food with you. WAW-HEL not even a single sandwich. HEL-NRT two poor meals low quality and quantity. In addition a strike at the airport and decision that we'll fly without people's luggage. Waited 4 days for it to come. Lost connecting flight from Tokyo due to delay (separate ticket). Seat assigned next to the lady with infant (her husband was seated in business). No power outlets in this type of A340 what I always considered as their differential advantage in Y.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,False
Finnair customer review,6,2011-05-28,Helsinki to Shanghai A340-300. Clean cabin food was not good enough. AY did not serve free alcohol. IFE should be improved. Toilets were clean.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,8,2011-05-19,HKG-HEL-HAM and MUC-HEL-HKG in business class A343 and E190 in very good condition. Brilliant lounge/spa in Helsinki. Angled flat beds on long haul comfortable and managed sleep both ways. Missed dinner on both flights due to very late departure time of both flights. Breakfast of very good quality. Very friendly flight attendants on all flight but especially impressed by crew from HKG to HEL. After waking up approx 5 hours out of HKG for a brief toilet visit flight attendant immediately asked I would like dinner or some sandwiches as I had missed my dinner. Only negative aspect would be the business class seating on the European segments on the E190. Same seat and pitch as in economy and as I was seated in row 1 a very unstable tray table. Crew on European segments friendly and food of good quality. Will certainly consider AY for my next trip to Europe especially as they have recently introduced full flat beds on their new A330's between SIN and HEL.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,5,2011-04-26,HKG-HEL then back through Bangkok in economy. Flight was okay staff were very icy (except for one nice FA) and connections were good. Flight time to Europe for Australians is lessened so another good thing. Food was reasonably dire and drinks expensive. Not sure I would go with them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Finnair customer review,7,2011-04-24,LHR-HKG PEK-LHR on Business via HEL. This is my second trip with Finnair and I still think they offer the best value for money in Business class. My main complaint is that the roll-out of flat bed seats is only beginning and the lie-flat on A340 to HKG was not very comfortable as I felt like sliding off my seat all the time even though I'm of medium build and weight. The 40 min connection in HEL to HKG was a concern for me but the flight attendants on the London flight assured me the flight would wait due to 20 passengers on the LHR-HEL leg waiting to connect on that flight. However it took a bit too long to de-ice the plane and some passengers who probably had short connections in HKG were getting quite agitated. Return flight from PEK was smooth and the Finnair lounge in Helsinki is always agreeable for a short layover though some warm food would have been appreciated like the Cathay Lounge in LHR which Finnair shares. Overall good value for money and they haven't let me down so far.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,5,2011-04-20,LHR-HEL-HKG return Economy. First experience of Finnair and overall impression is passable. LHR to HEL A320 on time. For a 3hr flight the onboard catering was miserly even by todays standards. HEL-HKG A340 departure on time which I understand is somewhat for a rarity on this route. Twice in the previous week this flight had been delayed by over 7 hours. Seat 43A recaro type seat with enough leg room for a 6 footer to get comfortable. Again catering was extremely poor with both option of main meal close to inedible. To add insult to injury 5 Euros for a G&T on a long haul flight was just plain greed. Staff efficient enough if not full of the joys. BA flight back from HEL-LHR reminded me of how good BA can be when they get it right. I would use again but only if cost was the main criteria.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,False
Finnair customer review,9,2011-04-18,A leisure flight Helsinki-Las Palmas in Comfort Class - new Business Class on A333 was a pleasant surprise especially the flat seats. A delicious breakfast was served though that was the only meal served. A modern AVOD system but the music/flim selection was rather limited. A friendly service.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,7,2011-04-17,CPH-HEL-HKG return. First leg of the flight was with Finnair A320 seats good with generous legroom and a free glass of juice. Pretty standard. The long haul legs were flown with A340-300 the seats had a good recline (more than my last experience with Aeroflot A332) but get a bit hard after a ten hour flight. Legroom good. The food was below average it felt very cheap and I have definitely tasted better. The AVOD have an OK amount of films and series but not a wide array like Emirates or Cathay.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,7,2011-04-16,LHR-HEL-SVX return. The trip began earlier in YUL on BA but from LHR on Finnair. The whole trip was booked on Finnair web site with codesharing OneWorld flights. LHR to HEL and back on a fully packed A320 nothing special plenty of drinks and a sandwich poor entertainment small screens most of them illegible no brightness/contrast. HEL-SVX started with a 1-hour delay waiting in the plane for de-icing. Embraer-190 was 20% full. Sandwich and plenty of drinks. I ordered special meals and got it 3 times of 4. However they have constructed the special meals of 3 different parts: rice cakes sliced veggies and cheese and wrapped each part separately with the plastic wrap than all three together with a plastic wrap again and put a big sticker on the top. So it was nearly impossible to unwrap the whole assembly. Also I have selected the exit row seats and those have been granted 3 times of 4 every time the questions have been asked if I spoke English etc. and a FA verified. The 4th time from SVX to HEL those seats were given to somebody else without any verification. Because the different airlines as a part of Oneworld Alliance were involved in my whole trip there were some inconveniences like it was impossible to check-in online for all legs of travel or to print all boarding passes at once or to select seats for each leg.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,7,2011-04-05,ZRH-HEL-HKG-HEL-ZRH before and after Christmas. Price for this season cheap. Feels like a tale of two airlines. Within Europe friendly staff (some more some less but still good). Sandwich nowadays in Europe normal but fine. Neighbour asked for second round and was willing to pay. Was given additional one for free and even asked if he liked another one. Transit from Europe to Asia easy even with only short transit time. Long haul seatpitch ok. IFE good but very limited choice. Food okay. However still weird that one has to pay for everything between the meal services. Even crew seems a bit embarrassed about that. Cabin crew (except for one FA on the way back) is reserved some clearly showing that they don't like their job. One already knows when advertising states that water bottle in seat pocket in Y means no or only one drinks service during the flight. Transfer coming from Asia a bit longer which is clear due to Schengen but some of the screening staff is borderline racist if one is not Caucasian looking. Still think value for money as one gets what one pays for.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,False
Finnair customer review,5,2011-04-03,HKG-HEL. The economy experience is very coarse heavily plastic a little like RyanAir gone long-haul. Flight attendant refused to hang my suit even though they had space and I'd been assured this wouldn't be a problem for economy on the outward leg. Food ok but clearly priced to a level only one pass with drinks. Slightly cheaper ticket buys a basic environment. Channel based entertainment system seems very dated in the modern era of VOD. Didn't feel four star. Very slow security process at HEL. Not recommended. HEL-MAN a much more pleasant experience - felt like a different airline; staff helpful and attentive.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,False
Finnair customer review,,2011-03-31,LHR-HEL-ROV. Plane broke down just prior to boarding at Heathrow. No information and farcical situation where we went to check-in 4 times back through security 3 times =(+ 3 times wrong way) passports twice customs once - without even leaving UK. Put on flight 8 hours later and told onwards connection that night. Arrived at Helsinki to discover flight actually next day and had to seek out Finnair staff at midnight (they were helpful) to sort out hotel for night. Flights themselves comfortable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Finnair customer review,6,2011-03-23,MAN-HEL-BKK return. Inflight entertainment is poor or non existent with very little choice. Meals either a sandwich or limited selection. Transfer from Helsinki to Manchester woeful hundreds of passengers queuing with no priority given to passengers and their flight times. Complained to Finnair regarding this but have not replied. Airbus fleet is modern is the only positive point I can find. Long way off middle east competitors.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Finnair customer review,9,2011-03-05,LHR-HEL-LHR. 0730 flight out of LHR nice breakfast in empty CX Lounge. Flight out was fine. Lounge in HEL great good seats overlooking gate area and good soup and salad. Adequate champagne on flight. Economy seats with a space in the middle as is usual for European flights 3 hours is about the most I would want in this seat.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,5,2011-01-29,OTP-HEL-BKK and return. Seats not terribly comfortable but acceptable AVOD not working well (sound so bad on most films that it was impossible to hear them) and the food on HEL-BKK the worst I have ever experienced.

Finnair customer review,9,2011-01-28,BKK-HEL-AMS-HEL-BKK Economy Class. The new A330 BKK-HEL-BKK was great (new AVOD IFE - if a bit limited in options) and cabin crew were very friendly. I don't like Finnair's free-grog- with-mealtimes - the window is too short but the haul is too long for this sort of thing. But at least the pay-on-board options were extensive. I found the meals on Finnair good - even the short-haul snack from HEL-AMS-HEL. A warm sandwich goes a long way in my book!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,,2011-01-21,Finnair either hit or miss. Sometimes you have very helpful staff and good experience - others very bad. Whenever something goes wrong they seem ill-equipped to handle it. I regularly fly a route that ends up connecting to the HEL-LHR flight and I've missed the connection several times. That in itself is not Finnairs fault but the staff at the transit desk despite you having been put out make it seem like they are doing you a favour to transfer to another flight. They won't transfer you onto the next BA flight as they prefer to make you wait for their next flight despite being code share / one world partners. Then having got your ticket you ask if you can be seated aisle/window/closer to front etc like your original seat but they won't fobbing you off to ask at the gate where they know full well they will be too busy to be able to change anything. Finnair used to be a first class airline and was doing well upgrading its fleet getting rid of all the old long haul MD80s etc but despite new fleet new code sharing it is still the same old staff who certainly in my opinion need refreshing as well.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Finnair customer review,6,2011-01-17,I travel London-Helsinki route regularly and prefer Finnair to BA. Finnair newer and there's programmes running on the tv-screens. I've found cabin crew friendly and attentive but food has recently gone a bit downhill - they're obviously tightening their belts. The seat pitch is what it is doesn't even seem to be much different in Business anymore either but is somewhat helped by the new design of the seats.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,7,2011-01-09,Bangkok - Manchester via Helsinki. This is a trip that we make nearly every year and normally we travel with one of the middle eastern carriers. This time however we left our booking a little late and were unable to get our preferred dates. Finnair was the only alternative at a reasonable price. Friendly service Helsinki an excellent place to transfer. The airport is very easy to navigate through staff are friendly and it was quiet when we passed through. There was even a play area near the gate to keep the kids happy. And free wi-fi that works straight away - no need to request a password first. Dislikes - No choice of meal: on one of the flights the only option was a beef sandwich. - The food was quite plain and boring in comparison with the airlines we usually use. Browsing through the entertainment system I couldn't find much worth watching.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,2,2011-01-04,CPH-HEL-HKG return. Food poor. Crew rude and patronising clear that there are union issues. Strikes common place. Information and apologies for missed connections in HEL little or none. Would avoid at all cost. I am gold on BA and Star alliance. Had surreal experience of senior stewardess telling my wife of at length for using the wrong toilet - hours after - we had to ask her to be quiet and leave our seat.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Finnair customer review,9,2011-01-03,LHR-HEL-RIX return. LHR-HEL delayed due to weather A320 spotless condition and attendants on this flight were superb. The snack was large enough and nice. The next morning we checked in for the flight to Riga and the plane was a comfortable E90 provided with drinks (Juice or water) for the 50 minute flight. Our return flight from RIX-HEL was delayed by snow. It left 40 minutes late and we were advised by the stewardess that we would not make the connection for our flight to Heathrow. Upon arriving at Helsinki staff at the transfer desk had arranged for us to stay at a hotel near the airport inclusive of meals. We were booked onto the flight to LHR the next morning. This flight was completely full and service on this flight was superb with a warm baguette snack and 2 drink runs. The seats in economy were comfortable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,7,2010-12-30,HEL-BKK in Economy. Fresh cabin on A340-300 good legroom seat a bit hard but comfortable enough. Cabin crew professional and attentive. AVOD entertainment but very limited selection of music and films. The dinner was the worst part of the experience looked as bad as it tasted. The breakfast was a bit better but expected more. Will choose them again to BKK if the price is right but catering and AVOD should be improved.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,6,2010-12-27,JFK-HEL A330. Cabin clean and nice looking. Check in smooth and on boarding we were greeted by 3 stewardesses and given newspapers and a bottle of water. Friendly cabin crew helped with bags. Efficient service and they managed to get my special meal right (after several phone calls) however food was average. Crew spoke several languages. IFE ok but have seen a lot better on other airlines. Easy disembarking in Helsinki Vantaa a pleasant airport. However Finnair customer service is non-existent. Had problems due to the strike and it was handled badly. Would recommend Finnair for onboard service but any kind of contact with the airline is handled in the most appalling way. The tickets are quite expensive and the service not matching many other 4-star airlines.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,True
Finnair customer review,,2010-12-20,I cannot submit a review for the onboard experience as we could not even get on the plane. I can however tell you about their horrible customer service which is almost non-existent. Trying to get a flight during the snow at Heathrow we were left standing at the check-in for 6 hours before we received any information from the 1 Finnair staff member who had stayed at the airport as all the others went home and left all the passengers stranded. When the announcement went over the loudspeaker that the flight was cancelled they told us to consult the check-in staff. By that time they had all gone. The UK Finnair customer service number was closed all weekend and the only 24-hour number was all in Finnish. There was no information about the delays anywhere on the website and although we had been told to come back the next day to the airport we found out from other sources that the flights were again cancelled. We then spent 2 hours on hold to finally be told that there were no flights available until a minimum of 4 days later. When I asked why other passengers who had booked on later flights were taking priority over us the customer service rep just kept reading the script 'Sorry we are fully booked'. Even after I explained that we had to make a connecting flight or we would miss our non-refundable trip in India that we had been saving for 6 months for there was no attempt to help and a refusal to upgrade us even though there were seats available on business class. I have to say this is the worst run airline I have ever encountered with the least helpful staff and the most shambolic management of any airline anywhere. Terrible check-in terrible website terrible phone support and shocking treatment of passengers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Finnair customer review,3,2010-12-13,I have had silver status for some years and Finnair has deteriorated considerably. The only plus is new planes but that`s it. Entertainment system with very poor selection meals below standard - on Asian routes they serve only one proper meal and one tiny hot sandwich. On short European routes only beverages are complimentary. FAs rather indifferent. Customer service is very poor - I emailed FF customer service asking about an award ticket but after 10 days they replied that I should call E-Business Help Desk in Helsinki (I live in Poland). What a poor customer service! Not up to 4 star airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Finnair customer review,7,2010-12-11,BKK to MAN via Helsinki. Due to the Finnair strike was re-booked onto BA for a flight leaving 15 hours later.

Finnair customer review,8,2010-11-16,AMS-HEL-BKK return. AMS-BKK was very good new single seats on A330 service and food very good. Return flight delayed almost 2hours later then planned. Captain and staff informed passengers every 20 minutes - delayed arrival missed connection to Amsterdam. Airport staff very friendly and did all they can to book on other (non AY flights). One thing AY could change is their IFE not much choice.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,9,2010-11-10,LHR-HEL-BKK return Business Class. Normally I travel direct to Asia so I was dubious about transfering in Helsinki but no worries. The lounge is bright and comfortable. BA Silver card holders get free drinks and food (also pre flight dining). I used the Spa (cost €40) - surprised to have to pay as I thought it was free for business travellers but worth every penny. A330 is spacious with mood lighting. Very attentive service delicious Scandinavian food and wine and the seat went flat. There are a number of single seats in cabin which I would have liked but was unsuccessful at checkin - should have been online earlier! Return leg I was convinced the 30mins connection time would mean a lost bag but my case was first off in London. . My one criticism would be the inflight entertainment system - choice is limited and bland and the blanket was too heavy and hot.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Finnair customer review,,2010-11-08,We were using Finnair for their direct flight Helsinki to Hong Kong. Arriving 30 minutes before midnight in Helsinki we were denied bording (due to overbooking as we found out the next day). We were not given any explanation ground staff was unfriendly and not at all service minded (refusing to discuss compensation or meal vouchers at all). We had to stay in a sub-standard airport hotel without facilities). The next day the experience continued: staff was unable to handle to the re-booking in a smooth fashion showed a high stress level and no service culture. Food at the Finnair long haul flights is 3/10 at the best. Cabin staff was alright but certainly not as friendly or customer oriented as Asian airlines. Our summary: never long haul with Finnair again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
