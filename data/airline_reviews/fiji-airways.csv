Unlike crew in the US who hide in the galley to gossip among themselves after service, the Fiji crew are on their feet, preparing carts for the next service, interacting with passengers in the galley, and making rounds with water. They had a mini snack bar set up in each section of the cabin, offered hot towels before breakfast and their meal quality is top notch. I mean who can complain about pancakes for breakfast!

The manager said someone from Fiji will call us but no one did. About 15mins later, I decided not to continue waiting and asked the on-site manager to call Fiji side for me. I finally had the chance to speak to the person in Fiji. She insisted to that we were supposed to pay a penalty for change of flight but we did not.

Also the boarding went smooth and all four flights I had departed on time. On one of my flights, just before take-off, a steward came to me and asked me whether I preferred to move to another seat that had an empty seat next to it, because of my height (6 foot 6/1.95 m.). I think this was very kind of him and in general I found the stewards on board very friendly and willing to help. The food and the in-flight entertainment was alright. It may not be as fancy or shiny as the food and entertainment you get at huge airlines like Emirates or Qatar, but for the money it was good value. For the meals you had a vegetarian and non-vegetarian option and the in-flight entertainment was sufficient. (again, Emirates may have a 150 movies to choose from and Fiji only 30, but you can't watch them all anyway) Also the seats were fine and just like any other company (besides maybe the more luxurious A380 seats). I would really like to recommend Fiji Airways to fly with if you want a good value for money.

Numerous passengers, including us, had to take items from their carry-on baggage and place them in their checked baggage. This seemed odd in that the total weight of all baggage taken did not change. Company policy varied by airport. For example, the airport in LAX refused to tag my wife's carry-on bag because, they said, it was oversize. She was, however, allowed to take it as a carry-on. (The attendant seemed to be very afraid of consequence with management.) On our return trip, my wife's carry-on bag was not questioned, but mine was. Also, an umbrella my wife was carrying was allowed to be sent as an item of checked baggage in Apia, but when we arrived in Nadi, they refused to allow her to take the umbrella either as a carry-on or as a checked item unless she was willing to pay $200 to have it checked. The hassle was unnecessary and the result of lack of uniform policies with the airline.

We had spend most our holiday in Suva while checking-in for our flight to Sydney which was via Nadi we were told by Fiji Airways that we will have to recheck ourselves again at Nadi for the Sydney flight. We were very disappointed to come to know about this? We were told well in advance prior to making our booking and while paying for the trip that we will not have to recheck ourselves at Nadi and will receive our bags in Sydney. The customer service staff said that we had been misinformed which was very disappointing and after my husband and i explained to them that this was our first trip to Fiji and we had big bags and we would appreciated it if they can check to see if it was a mistake of some sort. Fiji Airways customer Service said they couldn't do anything and were rude in their approach towards us. We were really disappointed and did not want any drama so we asked them if they can put us on a later connecting flight and were disappointed to know that there was no another flight late in the evening so sad and very disappointing since our connecting flight was 7 hours earlier.,False,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Suva to Syyney via Nadi,August 2015,1,1,,1,1,,,False

The flight over was okay, though the service wasn't great as meal service was slow and the food was really poor. Fine for 3.5 hour flight. Return flight was awful however, as we were on a smaller plane (the type usually used for domestic travel). It had only one aisle, so trying to get to the toilets was a nightmare. The toilets were filthy when we did get there. The food was again really terrible - bland chicken and pasta, no bread roll - just a weird cabbage and corn salad. My 7 year old son refused to eat any of it and was hungry for the rest of the trip. No snacks available. The seats were small and uncomfortable, there was no inflight entertainment other than shared screen playing ""just for laughs"" a gag comedy show. No flight map. The trip took almost 5 hours.

Meals were palatable and traditional curried Fijian fish was served. Once meals were cleared, no other drink rounds were offered but available when I asked.

They had downgraded the flight and half of the passengers (including us) had to wait for 9 hours, while the aircraft transported the lucky passengers and returned for us. This meant that we did not arrive at our hotel until 3.30. In my view, they failed to advise us of the situation to avoid cancellations.

We had excellent and friendly service in Auckland. The planes were reasonably comfortable especially if you got the two seats by the window. Flight attendants were friendly and as attentive as possible. Our sole problem was at the transit lounge in Fiji. While I'm assuming it's a temporary arrangement during construction it is cold depressing and a hard place to spend several hours. In addition the many repeat security searches seemed like overkill since we got off a Fiji plane were trapped in the concrete dungeon and then got on a Fji plane. Also a flight attendant on the plane from Auckland gave me a bottle of water as I de-planed which a security guard took away as we boarded our flight for LAX. Many people had bought water which was taken from them. This seems like a scam or at best a bad policy - passengers need to be warned if their drinks will be taken from them.

One thing that might have caught some people out was an earlier than normal check-in time for LAX-NAD (5pm for a 9.30pm flight) although this was sign-posted at the airport in the early afternoon. Boarding commenced an hour prior to take-off presumably because of a full flight. The inflight service was fine on all legs. The attendants were friendly and attentive.

Fiji Airways customer review,,2014-08-11,On transit in Nadi my name was not on the passenger list even though I had a ticket. According to a Fiji Airways representative this was normal: the communication between their central reservations and the airport could be better. Our flight to Honiara was aborted over Vanuatu and we returned to Nadi where Port Vila passengers were told to leave the plane and the rest of us were informed that we would have direct flight to Honiara. This departed three-and-half hours later. Two hours were spent matching the boarding passes with passenger lists. We arrived in Honiara at night after a six hour delay.

I called Fiji Airways to give them a heads up. I was informed it was the weather that caused the problem however then learned it was a fire in one of the main traffic towers. Again I called and informed Fiji Airways what was transpiring and that my flight was getting me in later. Finally we started to board and I called and said that I was going to miss the flight - this was a good 4 hours before FJ811 was due to take off. I was told that the fare was to be $120 for the change plus the change in fare which came to a total of $350. While I was giving my credit card information I was cut off. I immediately called back as I was in line to board and was then informed the fare was now $780. I do not know what sort of scam that was in motion but I am disgusted at the manner that the transaction occurred and feel I should be compensated back to the $350. A change of one day cannot be almost a full fare. I called numerous times to say I was going to be late and was accepting the change in price but to go to double in a matter of 2 minutes is contemptible and it would appear on the surface a way to extract more money due to duress.

Fiji Airways customer review,7,2014-02-13,Flew BNE-NAN as part of a longer itinerary in business. I wasn't provided with an express pass in BNE for exit immigration when I checked in though I barged my way through when they saw the biz class ticket. The ordinary line was 150 deep. The Qantas lounge in BNE used by FJ leaves something to be desired for an int'l biz lounge but it's adequate. The cabin condition on the 737 was worn. Service was excellent. The salmon in my lunch was rather desiccated from overcooking. Wines ok good spirit selection. Dessert was delicious and simple: a strawberry mousse cake. Would recommend.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,5,,,5,,,True
Fiji Airways customer review,8,2014-02-05,Flew FJ from LAX to SYD via NAN LAX-NAN was on a A330-200 the plane condition was good and clean still had the new plane smell the seats were comfortable even it was angled flat the meal and the service was good and was able to get 6-7 hours of sleep. We had 5 hour layover in NAN as we arrived at 4am every shop and lounge was closed until after 6am. The lounge condition at NAN was OK at best. Originally was booked on a A332 from Fiji to Sydney but noticed that they have switched equipment to B738 was looking forward to stretch out on flat bed seats and watch couple of movies on the 4 hour journey but unfortunately had to put up with regular recliner seats and provided tablet to watch the movie the service and the flight crew were excellent.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,,True
Fiji Airways customer review,10,2014-02-03,29th Dec 2013 Sydney-Nadi-LAX then return on 29th Jan 2014 with 3 other family members. Very pleasantly surprised-all cabin staff on all 4 flights very friendly and polite. I asked for a hot tea during cold drink service and it was brought to me as soon as service had finished. Sydney-Nadi boarded 10mins late but managed to leave only 2 mins late and all flights arrived 30 mins early. Nadi was longest transfer as only 1 person on desk. The food varied from ok to really good. It is airline food in Economy Class and Fiji Airways is not your top end Airline. Flight from Nadi-LAX left at 9.40pm so we had a small roll with vegetable patty served as snack but a large breakfast of scrambled eggs grilled veggies fruit muffin yoghurt juice and a breakfast bar. On return trip was prawn cocktail beef and rice fruit juice chocolate bar and scone. Both large meals were very tasty and vegetarian rolls also had a great flavour. Water was on offer regularly during flights. My only negative was that I had requested Vegetarian Meals for all 4 of us however this information did not get through. On trip to LAX there was a vegetarian option (although not booked) however on return flight there wasn't. The planes were new which was a bonus and seating although a little uncomfortable at times was probably more to do with being on a long flight than anything else. It felt no different to the 5hr flight Sydney to Perth on Qantas. Toilets were exceptionally clean at all stages of all flights. We went with Fijian Airways mainly due to cost. I was more than happy with the service and happy friendly nature of the cabin staff.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,,True
Fiji Airways customer review,2,2014-01-30,We booked our holiday's return flight trips to Fiji with Qantas airline. The route from London to Sydney was superb. Unfortunately Qantas have code shared with Fiji Airways and the trip from Sydney-Nadi-Sydney was operated by the Fiji Airways newest fleet. There's nothing good to say about the flight crew airline and services. The plane may be new but the inflight entertainment wasn't working properly and was told to pay if my family wanted to watch movies! There's no option when it comes to food. The only option including kids was a horrible wrap stuffed with scrambled eggs/chicken/tuna. The flight attendant looked disinterested and almost unwilling to help most of the time. Overall I personally wouldn't recommend Fiji Airways to anyone travelling to Fiji in the future.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,3,2014-01-28,Nadi to Melbourne. Flight was on time however there were multiple problems with the flight. Service staff was rude. They never handed out headsets so there were movies on but you couldn't hear them. I did ask an attendant for a headset but she said it would be a while because she had to serve everyone food and then she'd be able to bring it to me. Well I never did get the headset. The food is awful. Nobody expects great food on a plane but what they serve is just a small bun with some sort of nondescript patty coleslaw juice and a biscuit. Lastly we travelled with small children and they do not let people with small children board first. They also call people from certain rows and then just let anyone from any row board so it is a real free-for-all in terms of getting on the plane. Improve the service and the food and this airline could be considerably better.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,10,2014-01-17,Flew AKL-Nadi-LAX-Nadi-AKL in December 2013 and January 2014. Excellent service. Very nice clean and fresh cabin. Always on time (on the dot).

Fiji Airways customer review,4,2014-01-13,LAX-NAN-BNE. Check in at LAX efficient and friendly. Boarding and departure smooth and punctual. The cabin crew were polite and efficient. The airbus still had that brand new feel about it. The personal IFE worked well though the selection was limited. The two meals served LAX to NAN were actually pretty good. Regrettably the seat width and pitch seemed the most constricted I had ever experienced in an economy class on any airline. After two hours in the air I was very uncomfortable and eventually just being there was something like torture. I was glad when we landed at Nadi and I had a chance to get off the plane. The flight from NAN to BNE was on a rather dated 737 but the seats were wider with more legroom. Unfortunately the uncomfortable seating conditions on the airbus preclude me from ever flying with this airline again no matter how cheap.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,3,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,8,2014-01-13,Nadi-LAX. Business. Return evening flight back to States from Fiji. Fiji Airways performed to the great standard flying down here a weeks ago. Full cabin with children in business but very well behaved. Service was prompt and friendly as crew tried to give us as much time to sleep. Meals very good and seat was comfortable enabling 6 hours sleep which is great. I don't get that on BA club world. The angled flat sit is very good as I am not a fan of this seat at all. Breakfast wake was very cool with passengers lightly woken up which was a great touch.

Fiji Airways customer review,6,2014-01-09,MEL - Nadi and Nadi - HNL via Christmas Island. Booking-in in Melbourne was easy and we had no trouble changing to exit row seats with the very helpful air Fiji staff. Had a 12 hour layover between flights once in Nadi so needed to clear the airport which again was easy. Booking back in at Nadi airport was terrible. Only one counter open initially serving the business class passengers. Economy customers were booked in very slowly - we were 6th in the queue and it took us 45 minutes to get through. Flight was smooth although the air pocket we hit certainly woke everyone up. There was an hour layover in Kiribati on Christmas Island 5 hours into the leg to Honolulu. Worst experience we've ever had on a flight. Had to disembark and take all of our carry on. We were shuffled into what could be described as an animal holding pen which was at least out into the fresh air. We then had to be 'processed' in the most disgusting old building I've ever been in. Bags searched manually men had a hand held scanner waved over them and women got patted down. We were then herded into what could only be described as a chicken coup - the front door was locked and those lucky enough to get a seat had a good view out through the chicken wire window. Was very grateful it was only 30 deg outside as there was no fan and no air-conditioning - oh and the septic toilets joined onto the room so you can imagine the smell.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,,True

Fiji Airways customer review,10,2013-12-29,LAX-NADI. Business. What a great change this airline has made with fantastic crew superb planes and great food. The new A330 is a dream as are the seats one of the best angle flat I have slept on and got 6 hours sleep. The seat is incredibly comfortable. The cabin looks spacious. The crew are great and charming with nothing being a problem. Everything was delivered on a tray with a smile and bedding pulled out after dinner. Amazing surf and turf with good NZ wines breakfast was filling and delicious. We now have another Fiji Airways to AKL. Although the TV screens are large the film selection could be a little more current although not shabby. The overall performance is somewhat better than the Australian and New Zealand airlines.

Fiji Airways customer review,3,2013-12-25,SYD-NAN-SYD. Price was approx 40% higher then other airline due to inflight entertainment/meal. Entertainment was Ok. Would have been better with sound.

Did same trip in August 2013 business class. Flight 2.5 hrs delayed with no warning. Sitting at the airport in Melbourne with three very small children until 2 am was awful. Plane downgraded to 737 from 747. No kids meals. Despite having 4 out of 8 business class seats we did not get a meal choice. No individual televisions except bright overhead ones that kept our kids awake the whole flight. Who needs TV at 4 am? Luggage lost. Flight back delayed 2 hrs but no communication.

My wife was 5 months pregnant and her tray table had to be held up with a cushion TV did not work on any of our 3 seats (row 65 - but spoke to a lot of other people and their TV's did not work either) - food not fit for economy! Staff were pleasant enough but plane was falling apart cosmetically and because they retire the 747's in November no effort is made to make the journey more comfortable and no apology or compensation for putting up with such low standards. We requested to change to the newer planes hard enough to entertain a 3 year old for 17 hours but we booked as they said they had personal screens. Would help if they worked. I was very polite on the phone and asked if they could make this date change to travel on the Airbus a few days later and they said not without a high date change fee per person!

Bags: Only allowed 1 bag as to check in anymore would cost 120 usd each - no notification on ticket or booking ref about this. Water: security take all your water off you even water purchased in transit lounge but sadly apart from a drink with so called meal there was no more water offered on LAX to Fiji flight. Food: would hardly feed it to my dog. Entertainment: if you get a seat that the wires work to the earphones you have done well. Speaker above us screamed some hideous noise for about a minute every 20 or so minutes for the whole trip and even though aircraft sat on tarmac during transit no repair was done so from Fiji to SYD same very loud screeching occurred.

Fiji Airways customer review,,2013-09-22,Booked a flight via Qantas website so expected quality of a full flight airline which is code shared with Qantas. Bitterly disappointed MEL-NAN-MEL - 5.5 hour flight is extremely uncomfortable - even the new A330 has the most uncomfortable seats I have ever experienced. Food on a previous Jetstar flight to Hawaii was far superior to the chicken burger (mini) and mushy salad (mini). The flight to NAN was the coldest I have ever experienced. Entertainment was at a cost (except for one movie and three TV programs) - even music was at a cost. Staff were pleasant but not interested - so different to the resort staff and other tourist staff in Fiji. The airline has made a lot of the change of name and change of uniform - a change of value for money as a full priced airline is in order.

We went to Qantas at 4.30am and they had had no information from Air Pacific. Qantas staff were excellent and booked us on a Qantas flight to Auckland and then Air Pacific/Fiji Airways to Nadi. Some passengers had been warned about the lack of seats and others including ourselves had not.

Fiji Airways customer review,,2013-07-07,Nadi - Melbourne - 15/06/2013 and 06/072013. All Melbourne flights delayed due to operational issues. This seems to be normal for Fiji Airways you turn up to the airport stand in the line for 45 minutes and get told the flight is delayed.

Fiji Airways customer review,9,2013-06-11,Sydney to Nadi June 7th on the brand new A330-200 (first time in use from SYD). What can I say they overtaken any European or US airline even Qantas (which code-share on these flights). Specious seats best legroom a full service airline can offer. Food was surprisingly very good. Free alcoholic beverages. Personal IFE on demand with the latest movies. A quick and good service. Always with a smile. I ask for vegi meal on board and immediately after take off received one. It seems they have made 180 degrees change for their new branding. I flew a lot with many airlines around the world and I'm not easily giving away complements. Except for the screaming Aussie kids which really not the airline fault the all experience was very good.

Fiji Airways customer review,10,2013-03-01,Roundtrip LAX-Nadi-Auckland in Feb. This is a tiny airline that is trying hard to provide good service. We got a great deal on our flights so my expectations were low from the get go. Their 747s are older. They only have 2. One was in better condition than the other. They are being retired this year. The inflight entertainment didn't work on many seats. Sometimes the screen wouldn't turn off so it was hard to sleep with it on. The seats recline perhaps a little too much which I'm guessing is to do with their age. The food is fair. The larger dinner and breakfast food was better than the smaller snacks. Its not as bad as some people have made it out to be on here. I would buy food in the airport if you are picky. They seem to keep their cabins on the warmer side so it was a bit uncomfortable until they lowered the lights for people to sleep. Then the temp got to a comfortable level. Staff were friendly and seemed to care about the airline and their work. Id fly them again on a budget.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,,,5,,,True
Fiji Airways customer review,,2013-03-01,I flew into LA only to wait 3 days for a flight to NZ! They were terrible at communicating and the problem had been going on for a week.

Return flight took us from NZ to Fiji where again we spent another 2 days mostly waiting in the endless lines at the hot and dirty airport.

On the return we were never notified that our flight was cancelled! We had even gone to the counter early and they said to come back when we came back they said our flight was cancelled and they did not assist at the counter with new flights. We were stranded!

Fiji Airways customer review,9,2013-02-18,Nadi to LAX today and was pleasantly surprised. Flight was on time an upgrade was offered to upper deck and my wife and I had 3 seats each which allowed plenty of room and comfort. The dreaded food box arrived and to be honest for the time of night was perfectly adequate sandwich wrap crisps coleslaw and a drink.

Fiji Airways customer review,4,2013-02-12,BNE-NAN-BNE. Basically this is an airline that charges full-fare for what is in reality a low-cost business model to them at least: awful food (a revolting soggy 'sandwich' of some kind and a small plastic pot of coleslaw on both the outward and return journey) a cramped ugly and dirty cabin toilet doors that do not lock. All this is mentioned in many other reviews. No IFE apart from the one movie broadcast from overhead. I was not interested in the selection at all. On the positive side beers wines and spirits are available and the crew do try and display the well-known Fijian friendliness and cheerfulness despite working in the same dismal conditions that we are travelling in.

Fiji Airways customer review,9,2013-02-04,I chose them simply because they were by far the cheapest. I flew LA-Nadi-Sydney this morning: although this meant a nearly 4hour layover in Fiji it was actually the same 747 which took me the whole way. Check in was quick and friendly (even Tom Bradley operated favourably for me!) and my first impression of the cabin was that I liked the colour - somewhere between lilac and purple. I had no problems with the seats (although I did have a very large person sitting next to me on the second leg who kind of spilled into me I fixed that by moving) and they seemed to recline as much as any do. Dinner was fine the coffee actually tasted better than any other airline coffee I've had. Beer was freely available. I knew that breakfast would not be great but I don't really eat breakfast anyway. I also knew the IFE was old so came prepared. But the crew were the stars - full of good humour.

Fiji Airways customer review,7,2013-01-29,MEL-NAN-MEL - Departed and arrived on time on both legs. Cabin crew were good. IFE very limited and food for a non-budget airline was beyond a joke. Due to change in circumstances we had to change our return flight in the end it was cheaper to get a one-way ticket than amend the existing booking. There are limited carriers to Fiji therefore have few options unless you want to upgrade to business class.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,1,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,2,2013-01-28,PER-SYD-NAN return. Given we booked with Qantas we had not realised the SYD-NAN leg was with Air Pacific under their codeshare agreement until it was too late too change. I can only reiterate what others have said. The food is a joke the IFE barely functions and the seats are very uncomfortable. The toilets were filthy the sinks did not drain and so on.

Fiji Airways customer review,10,2013-01-28,We travelled from LAX to AKL. We found them excellent no delays fast check-in lots of leg room on the 747.

Fiji Airways customer review,8,2013-01-28,I had not been expecting much in the light of previous comments but I was pleasantly surprised by a well- organised flight. It was a late evening flight and the airport and lounge were deserted. The fairly small lounge had good canapés and drinks but only one computer and very little reading matter. The 737 appeared old and the seat rather battered. I could not make the recline controls work properly. The 8-seat business cabin was full. The beef dinner with wine was tasty. The cabin crew were friendly and efficient. IFE was satisfactory for the length of flight. The flight departed on time and arrived slightly early. Apart from the old seat a very good flight.,False,,,Business Class,,,2,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,,True
Fiji Airways customer review,,2013-01-14,Sydney - Nadi return. Check in good on time flight. My issues were with the food and entertainment. For a full service airline the food was appalling and inedible. 06.30 flight food consisted of orange juice tiny yoghurt bag of sliced apple and a small piece of fruit cake! Return trip was orange juice 2 biscuits tiny tub of pasta and a tiny hotdog in a bun. It was also barely warm. Any extra food was charged for. I have been fed better on no frills airlines! Entertainment was drop down screens from ceiling that due to the seat I was in was either too far away or right above me making watching impossible. I understand the entertainment will be fixed when their new planes arrive! I will fly another airline next time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,8,2013-01-10,Flight was on time - no trouble with check-in or out. We got food and headphones/movie included without charge and pillow etc. Got from A to B in good time.

Fiji Airways customer review,,2013-01-09,Worst experience in 30+ years of flying. Checked with airline 3 times prior to going to the airport as there had been a storm in Fiji. Told all was well and on time. Arrived at airport and stood in line for 2 hours to be told of a 12 hour delay. Got to LA far too late to catch any planes to San Francisco. Put up in a reasonable hotel but then the same thing happened in LA! Told we were booked to San Francisco to find the flight was cancelled the night before and we weren't notified. Didn't get to SFO until nearly midnight after spending a night in LA. Things happen but keep us informed and don't make people stay in airport lounges for 10-12 hours needlessly. Will never fly with them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,,2013-01-09,My wife and I were booked on a flight from Sydney to LAX (with stop in Nadi) on Dec 9 2012. About midnight on Dec 8 I called to confirm the flight and was told the flight from Nadi to LAX had been cancelled. No attempt to notify anyone on the flight. Told Air Pacific would provide vouchers but no other assurances were made. There was a long wait in Nadi for Air Pacific to make arrangements for all the passengers. There was a minimal voucher provided that did cover the hotel cost plus one meal. The flight to LAX the next morning was on an ancient 747. In the 3 seats in which my wife and I were located and the 3 in front only 1 light worked. Two seats did not recline. None of the 6 seats had a working TV so there was no entertainment. The food was bad. When we finally arrived in LA we were told that Air Pacific would not reimburse any expenses we incurred except for providing hotel in LA. We were forced to pay the change ticket costs of our connecting flight in LA.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,2,2013-01-09,AKL-NAN on 12 Dec. The service and food was unacceptable considering the cost of a return ticket I have travelled a lot with Air Pacific in the past and the service and food has deteriorated considerably. Food and beverage supplied - small hot dog container of inedbiel pasta and an orange drink - smacks more of a low level budget airline. My wife and I also travelled from NAN to CHCH return on 23 and 30 Dec. Same horrible inedible food and definitely no Xmas spirit. Shocked at the quality of the food on this flight considering its a 4 hr journey. We travel for the last time with Air Pacific to AKL on the 13th Jan.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,1,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,,2013-01-02,Return trip Honolulu to Brisbane. My wife and I arrived at Honolulu International and were told that our flight to Brisbane was delayed two hours and we might not make our connection in Nadi to Brisbane but Air Pacific would get us on another flight and accommodate us as necessary. We had no issue with this as delays happen. When the two hours were up the airline announced that there would be a further 90 minutes delay and they would issue a voucher for lunch. We returned to the gate after 90 minutes and Air Pacific told us that the aircraft would not be flying. After a considerable time we managed to retrieve our bags lined up for the shuttle. We were about to board our shuttle when Air Pacific staff turned up to announce our aircraft was now flying - everyone thought he was joking. They had to retrieve people from hotels who had already checked in. Again we had to check our bags back in and go through security. Finally we were aboard the aircraft 7 hours late. We arrived in Nadi at midnight - a general announcement was made about the options. There was mass queue jumping and they were dealing with 2 or 3 people at once - it was farcical. When we got to talk to someone we asked could we fly to the Gold Coast. At first this couldn't be done then this changed and we were on an Air Pacific flight to Auckland then a Virgin flight to the Gold Coast. We went to the shuttle to be transferred to the overnight hotel. In Auckland the Transfer Desk is only manned by Air NZ and they issued us Qantas boarding passes to Brisbane. The flight to Brisbane was like 5 star service compared to 2 star service we had received from AP.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,,2012-12-20,Flew Nadi to LAX on 10 Dec 12. No boarding organization. Paid a lot extra to sit in Business Class. Narrow uncomfortable seats. Seat broken - would not recline so little or no sleep during 10 hr flight. Headset broken sound was all static no movie menu from which to chose screen was extremely small movie already in progress and no controls to restart. Because of this didn't watch or listen to anything. Because of dietary restrictions could not eat anything on the dinner menu. Cheese offered during inflight snack was stale. Ordered drink which I did not receive. Always had to ask for water or get your own. Slow unacceptable service. This was not even close to any other Business Class comfort and service. Will not fly Air Pacific again.,False,,,Business Class,,,1,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,7,2012-12-20,Flew out Nadi on Tuesday 18/012/12. Ground staff were helpful. Flight crew and service very good given the circumstances.

Fiji Airways customer review,2,2012-12-14,Flight SYD-Nadi on 7th Jan 2012. Flight was cancelled and ground staff unhelpful. Contacted the reservation team in Fiji that appeared helpful at first but were really were not accommodating. Had to book alternative flight to reach destination. My return flight from Nadi to Sydney was with the carrier on a Boeing 737-800. The flight was mediocre nothing memorable. Staff pleasant enough but not above the call of duty.

Fiji Airways customer review,3,2012-12-14,Flew from LAX to NAN and back. TVs don't work. Food is pathetic. Cabin crew disinterested. NAN check-in is long lines with unfriendly staff.

Fiji Airways customer review,1,2012-12-05,Our flight home from Fiji to Sydney was scheduled for 9am it was delayed 2 hours and ended up being delayed 7 hours before we left at 4pm. Our flight broke down in Sydney and they didn't have an aircraft for us. Once they had arranged an aircraft it wasn't even Air Pacific it was a Portuguese airline. We arrived in Sydney at 7pm but had missed our flight scheduled for 5pm back home. Air Pacific refused to take responsibility for the delay. We were stranded in Sydney overnight and they basically told us to sleep on the floor of the airport.

Fiji Airways customer review,6,2012-12-04,NAN-SYD Boeing 737-800. Check-in was quick through dedicated business class check in with friendly check- in staff. Express through security and immigration. Tabua lounge is small and adequate choice of drinks and food was just sandwiches. Plane was old and seats were uncomfortable was an old aircraft. Cabin crew friendly and attentive. Didn't have my choice of meal but my food option was excellent. Entertainment pretty old and screens were small. All in all good flight but planes need to be upgraded.

Fiji Airways customer review,2,2012-11-26,Flew to Hawaii via Fiji. Flight delayed for over 3 hours in Sydney due to internal PA system not working. All passengers were on board and communication was limited. This delay caused us to miss our connecting flight to Hawaii and the next flight out was Sunday evening. Service was below standard - flight attendants didn't display any concern for your situation and the food was awful. If you do send an email to provide feedback or raise a complaint they take about 4-5 weeks to respond - you have to keep following up with them. I would recommend using another carrier when travelling to Fiji.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,7,2012-11-19,NAN-VLI. Check-in was smooth and quick. Friendly agents at the counter. The Tabua lounge is a nice area to relax whilst waiting for the flight grabbing a snack and working on emails.

Food was ok not the best but edible!,False,,,Business Class,,,4,3,,,4,,,True
Fiji Airways customer review,4,2012-11-16,Upon boarding we weren't greeted at all. I sat down to find my seat was broken which the flight attendants ignored me whenever I tried to point it out. They continued to be quite disinterested throughout the flight. The inflight entertainment screen (one every three rows from the roof) was broken so we couldn't watch the movie so the flight was a little boring! I would choose to fly with a different airline in the future.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,2,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,1,2012-11-13,Sydney to Nadi (747). The cabin crew were excellent and polite however what let the experience down was the very sub standard in flight meals and entertainment. I have never seen until now that the meal was delivered in a box similar to a Happy Meal that contained an artificial sausage on a bread roll a fruit juice cup of paste and some biscuits. I remember the old Air Pacific that had a 1st menu for economy. The seats on the flights were so close that when the person in front put their seat back you couldn't see the entertainment screen. The actual movies and picture quality was so poor you could not watch the movies. My advice is to select another carrier to Fiji.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,7,2012-11-12,With the exception of one flight departure change my wife and I found AP very good value for money. The positives were on time departure and arrivals for all but one of our 4 flights ground and air staff were helpful pleasant and courteous. Ordered special meals on every leg and they came prior to other passengers and they were correct every time. Yes the 747's they fly for long hauls are dated but they were comfortable enough and when I look at what other fares were from LA to Brisbane the value for money equation was decidedly in favour of Air Pacific for our budget. The only negative was a schedule change that came out of the blue. Overall budget considered I would fly AP again. A suggestion to potential future flyers of AP is to check double check and maybe even triple check your itinerary at each leg of your journey.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,,True
Fiji Airways customer review,,2012-11-06,LAX to Nadi and back in October 2012. On the flight down TV screens did not work no overhead light working and their were no air vents. Staff tried to fix TV sets after their solution didn't work all they could say was 'sorry do you want a comment card'. On the way home from Nadi to LAX we were hoping for better seats and got worse. The seat in front of me was completely broken and occupied by a rather large lady when she sat down she was practically in my lap and our TV screens didn't work again. Food was awful service poor.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,7,2012-11-06,We flew in Sep and Oct 2012 from LAX to Nadi on our way to Port Vila Vanuatu. All four segments were on time to the minute. All checked baggage which originated in SLC through Delta arrived on time and unscathed. Meals were adequate and served with a smile. Seats were no more uncomfortable than any other 747-400 (although the transfer airport in Nadi was woefully inadequate.) We would not hesitate to fly with them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,,True
Fiji Airways customer review,2,2012-11-05,FJ910 SYD-NAD on Fri 2 Nov this is a holiday or budget airline and rightly deserves the 2 star Skytrax rating. For lunch they provided a small hotdog juice small pasta salad and biscuits in a small box. Very bland. Seat was very uncomfortable - I guess old 747's while they wait for their new A330's in March.

Fiji Airways customer review,2,2012-11-01,We flew Brisbane to LA and back. The food was awful as indicated in many reviews. On Brisbane to Nadi flight door lock for one of the toilets was broken and could not be locked and the other one was faulty as well but it was lockable - not very convenient obviously. On LAX-BNE flight ground staff said we should have Fiji visa to go on transit. She called Fiji department of immigration from US to get clearance and made us wait 20 minutes during check in realising that we did not need any visa she did not apologise at all instead she mentioned that we are not allowed to go to Fiji and we have to transit to Australia (which obviously was our intention in the first place).,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,,2012-10-29,SYD-Nadi-LAX 14-10-12. Flight was ok food - the worst airline food I've seen. Staff very slow or just not enough of them they give you your boxed meal drinks etc at cruising height then about 1 hour later they finally come back to collect the rubbish. At this point you are locked in by your tray table. LAX-SYD 25-10-12 overall the same problem as 1st flight - terrible food slow staff.

Fiji Airways customer review,7,2012-10-23,Brisbane to Nadi on 19/10/2012 found the flight comparable to other airlines based on the short length of the trip we were fairly satisfied. Flew a 747-800. The food as indicated on so many reviews was not the best however it is a short trip. Staff were great could not say the same for some of the passengers letting their kid run up and down the plane this flight was FJ920.

Fiji Airways customer review,2,2012-10-22,Travelled Sydney to Nadi return with 11 members of my family. Pre-arranged seating was ignored family scattered in several areas from front seat 2nd floor to second last row on lower deck. Food is perhaps the worst that I have ever experienced. Staff friendly but inefficient airline promises a child pack for entertainment. On 1 sector 2 of 4 delivered and on return with maybe 40 children on the flight none were distributed. Air Pacific is the only full service airline on this route but has it's own definition of full service. A very poor airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,2,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,7,2012-10-12,Flew Sydney and Nadi and back in September. All flights on time and staff friendly. The flights had a holiday feel with the island themed music when you first board. The dreaded lunchbox service was a bit of a shame - there wasn't much food and what was there wasn't very appetizing. The 747 service is by an old Singapore Airlines plane (still some logos in the toilets) with the old first-generation seatback from the late 90s. The movies aren't on demand so you can safely watch one but the second will probably be cut half-way through when they switch the system off some time before landing.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,,True
Fiji Airways customer review,1,2012-09-18,Flew from Melbourne to Nadi on March 2012. Flight got delayed (as always). No explanation given. Our return flight was delayed due to weather and communication. Having paid premium airfare food served was pathetic. A chicken burger with a cold slice of chicken on a tiny bun. Air Pacific needs to revamp it's catering and customer service to win good ranking as other airlines like Emirates Singapore etc. I will definitely choose another airline next time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,1,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,2,2012-09-16,They changed flight times by 8 hrs without giving notice. This caused missed connections with other airlines and left us stranded without hotel reservations.

Fiji Airways customer review,2,2012-09-04,Travelled Air Pacific for the first time in August 2012 with my wife to Los Angeles with a stop in Fiji to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Flight was delayed over 1 hour before takeoff with no communication on the reason for the delay or how long until take off. We were kept seated on the aircraft without air conditioning on a very hot day during this period. In any case I accept these things happen and is not the reason for my dissatisfied flight. On arrival to Los Angeles for our three week vacation my luggage was missing and no assistance provided to find it besides asked to complete a form.

Fiji Airways customer review,5,2012-09-04,My first experience flying with Air Pacific I found the meals to be very unsatisfactory. Sydney to Nadi at 6.30am I survived only on an apple bag small yoghurt and juice. Couldn't stomach fruit cake at that time of day. On return from Nadi to Sydney midday meal was worse. Some sort of terrible chicken sausage thing on a dinner roll (that my two children found inedible) biscuits and juice. Almost a five hour flight and I had to ask for additional biscuits as my kids were starving which the air hostess wasn't impressed about. Had to stay on the tarmac in Sydney and wait for quarantine to board our plane to check on a sick child.

Fiji Airways customer review,3,2012-08-29,SYD-NADI on 737 and return on 747. No complaints with the actual flight itself and the staff were polite and as good as other airlines. However the catering on board at the moment is insufficient and not appropriate for a full service air fare. On the way over on the early morning flight we were served the dreaded 'breakfast pack' along with tea/coffee/water. The box contained apple pieces tiny orange juice tiny yoghurt and a small piece of fruit cake. Even know it is a relatively short flight this is not good enough when leaving at 0630. Unfortunately the return flight was worse and after a 60min delay after boarding we again received the 'box' which contained orange juice yoghurt a small tub of fruit salad and a cup cake the size of a 20c coin. This was all that was served in 5.5 hours of flights with no further offers of drinks or snacks. People had to grab the hostesses as they walked past (the call buttons did not work) and ask them for food and drinks as they were hungry. Not good enough in my view and would not fly with them again if could help it.

Fiji Airways customer review,3,2012-08-16,On round the world trip I was connected with Air Pacific flights from Christchurch to Nadi and again from Nadi to Sydney. I was really happy with the flight staff but I was so disappointed with the in flight meal. Served in a small box with very small portions.

I spent 4 extra days in travel on one trip. Air Pacific does not care about customer service because they are the only airline that goes direct from LAX to Fiji.

Fiji Airways customer review,8,2012-08-09,I have been travelling to Fiji for many years on Air Pacific and yes the service has changed considerably particularly in the last two years. I have left some negative feedback in the past. However we must accept changes. Is it absolutely necessary that people travelling from the east coast of Australia be offered more than a snack and something to drink. In economy now on an early afternoon flight you get a cup of tea and a biscuit. Yes there are some things that we would probably like to have changed.

In flight entertainment was not suitable for the length of the flight as the movie had to stop prematurely. The aircraft interior looked old and worn out. The flight was full of carry on luggage.

Lounge basic but comfortable and away from kids. Flight departed on time. Aircraft downgraded from 747 and re-timed 2 hours earlier but this was communicated via email. Seat comfortable enough for 737 with much better leg room than Qantas J 737’s. Did not eat however the menu looked extensive. Crew happy to put aside a cheese plate for later and wines kept topped up. Service delivered efficiently if not as enthusiastically as I would expect. IFE available but was unwatchable due to video and audio quality. Digi-players provided on some flights/aircraft and I would have appreciated these being available for this 6 hour flight given Air Pacific seem to be aware of the poor quality of the IFE. Priority bags delivered first and through customs and on the way home in 20 minutes of arriving. Would be disappointed in this flight except that the sale price of our J fare was only A$250 more than discounted economy fare so excellent value for some extra comfort in this small cabin of 8.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,1,2012-05-09,We travelled from Nadi to Auckland and the flight was awful. A few years ago you used to get a nice hot meal with quite a good breakfast and lunch/dinner. These days they serve you garbage in green cardboard boxes consisting of snacks which cost less than $10. You are better to grab a snack at the Airport before boarding as the food is awful.

Fiji Airways customer review,9,2012-03-23,We connected in Los Angeles from Alaska Airlines to Air Pacific for our Fiji flight. We walked between terminals however the boarding pass issued by Alaska in Seattle was not sufficient to get past TSA at the International Terminal. Wwe felt very rushed at LAX and were the last to board. We sat in Row 28 with no one between us so had an extra seat. My TV didn't work so it was a long 10 hours.

Only upon noticing the changes were we able to rebook our flights which meant extended layovers in Fiji. We were told due to the delay our hotel would be covered by Air Pacific. We arrived in Nadi to find the help desk closed and at the hotel told there was no booking.

From Nadi to Sydney we were advised we are only allowed one piece of carry on luggage and had to pay excess baggage and check-in the second piece of carry on. Encountered substantial delays which seemed to be the result of poor organization.

Fiji Airways customer review,2,2012-02-16,My experiences with Air Pacific staff have been lacking in dignity professionalism and basic courtesy. I have seen an air-hostess roll her eyes and 'tch' at a young boy because he stopped her to ask for another drink. I walked to the galley to ask for a second drink. The female attendant picked up a glass that already had something in it and proceeded to put ice in it. I made a point of asking for a fresh glass. Her response was immediately sarcastic 'oh you don't want this one..okaaay' and when she handed me my 'fresh' glass remained with her back to me while continuing her conversation with her colleague.

Fiji Airways customer review,3,2012-02-04,I travel to and from Melbourne to Nadi every 3 months in business. Part of my enjoyment of the upgrade is the business lounge before boarding. For about 1 year now the business lounge has downgraded! There used to be a wide variety of snacks as well as a good selection of wine and champagne. Now one can only expect toasted sandwiches no wine no champagne no nuts of course the spirits are still there but I always leave hungry- disappointing considering the extra money I paid. Once onboard I have to agree that most flight attendants are rude and make you feel as if you are bothering them. As the planes are usually small by the time the attendant gets to you often your meal choice has run out. The wine on offer is so cheap it should not even be offered in economy let alone Business Class. Also used to receive complimentary toiletry bags now they have also been stopped! I would like to know why when we are paying more and the prices are going up but the quality is continually going down.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,2,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,1,,,False

At the back of the aircraft it was hotter than the ambient Fiji air temperature when we arrived midsummer. The food was a warm unrecognizable soft slop consistency. Crew - What crew?

Fiji Airways customer review,1,2012-02-03,This was the worst experience of flying I have encountered. From start to finish the service was nothing short of appalling. Some of the problems were - not notified of a departure time change delayed in Nadi for 10 hrs with no information or assistance provided. No inflight entertainment that worked seats did not recline or had broken tray tables. Over hot cabin temperature causing many passengers to feel faint. Extremely poor service from cabin crew who did not attempt to provide any beverages or assistance. Dirty toilet facilities.

Fiji Airways customer review,1,2012-01-31,Nadi through to LAX. Staff members were not interested in customer service nor did they smile at boarding passengers. After a relaxed safety briefing I attempted to use the inflight entertainment many of the televisions did not work. The aircraft was extremely cold and seating area was very cramped. Many passengers became quite alarmed when the air conditioning vents started leaking large amounts of water people had to move seats to avoid getting wet. Furthermore the meal was a cold hot dog bun with shredded chicken and grated carrot.

Fiji Airways customer review,2,2012-01-28,Pacific Sun is the domestic subsidiary of Air Pacific. They have serious trouble keeping schedule. In the past 6 weeks friends visiting here in Fiji were delayed one day each trip from Nadi to Savusavu. They had to fly in and out of Labassa each trip a 90 minute drive from where they booked to arrive. My brother was held up for 2 days on the way back to Sydney and one day on the way here. As I write my mother in law is waiting for her flight in Nadi to Labassa she will arrive at 16.30 rather than 11.00 and again a 90 minute taxi ride from where she was suppose to end up. Pacific Sun’s excuses are numerous however it does seem to be factor of poor management and poor discipline. The lack of domestic competition gives them no reason to pick up their game.

Fiji Airways customer review,3,2012-01-28,We flew LA to Sydney via Fiji and then Auckland via Fiji back to LA for four flights. The total time delay we experienced on these four flights was more than 8 hours ranging from 1/2 hour to more than 4 hours.

Fiji Airways customer review,5,2012-01-24,Auckland-Nadi Jan 22. Arrived at Auckland airport to find flight delayed from 2pm until 3pm. An hour later the issue was fixed but we were told there was a more serious problem. At 7pm 4 hours on we were told that connecting passengers were being transferred to the LAX flight on Air NZ. Fiji passengers were delayed until 11pm as a plane was coming from Fiji. Air New Zealand ground staff were handling the issue and did a fantastic job giving out vouchers and helping passengers. We finally took off at midnight – thankful we had paid $300.00 for an upgrade to a very old and tired business class – with a tired crew who were doing an unexpected double shift. The flight was uneventful the food and service OK (but well below what you would expect for an international airline) and the crew clearly tired.

Fiji Airways customer review,3,2011-11-17,Sydney to Nadi return. Our outbound flight was delayed 3 hrs and the food was terrible. The inflight entertainment was a selection of movies and the system worked intermittently. According to resort staff Air Pacific have a shocking on time record.

Fiji Airways customer review,2,2011-10-27,Melbourne to Nadi B767-300. We were served a meal as soon as the flight levelled off and it was awful. 3 hours into the flight I asked an attendant for water I had to wait 30 minutes and when I pressed the courtesy light the FA said she would be with me shortly. 10 minutes she appeared with a warm bottle of water with an unpleasant smile. Thirty minutes before landing there was an announcement that the bar was closed. Air Pacific advertises itself as a full service airline however the service on this flight was that of a limited service airline.

Fiji Airways customer review,2,2011-10-21,Seattle transfer through LAX to Nadi Fiji. The only airline that flies to Fiji from the USA was Air Pacific and they are the worst. Our original flight going home was 9pm Tuesday - Air Pacific canceled the flight at 5.30pm Tuesday and didn’t notify anyone. We got to the airport to wait in line for over an hour to get our vouchers. The flight rescheduled for 0600 Wednesday and we waited in line for two hours to get rebooked (airport was unorganized and complete mess). Air Pacific agents allowed us to carry on our bags but airport security wouldn’t let us carry on our bags because we were over their ridiculous 7 kg limit – our bags were the right size but a bit overweight 9 kg and 11 kg but we had nothing but original clothes we carried to Fiji! The plane was delayed another 6 hours after we boarded the plane so we de-boarded and waited. Total delayed time of 16 hours plus missing our connecting flights which Air Pacific said they would re-book but failed to deliver on – we worked it out with our connecting airline Virgin America which was great about re-booking us. I highly advise not flying Air Pacific and they are the only reason why I will think twice about going back to Fiji.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,,False

Fiji Airways customer review,,2011-09-08,Nadi-Auckland Economy on old 747. All seats and fittings are long in the tooth. Food and beverage service was terrible - a sandwich in a plastic bag is not good enough for a full service airline. We experienced heavy turbulence during the flight the Pilot said nothing of the incident and the crew pretended nothing happened. The Tabua Club at Nadi is a sad excuse for a lounge there was toast and a tiny fruit platter. The only good thing is that it was quiet compared to the madness of the wider terminal.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,7,2011-09-08,Been using for years to fly from NAN to AKL CHC and SYD both in Economy and Business cabins.

This is not good enough for what the airline is calling full service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Fiji Airways customer review,,2011-09-07,Return to Nadi Business Class from Brisbane. Old aircraft with only 8 seats in BC. My seat would not recline at all headsets crackly and distorted. Service was awful my husband and I chose the chicken dish but were told they only carried 2 of each choice and someone had already ordered the chicken. Same with the dessert only one cheese plate available. Tray covers had been used on the inbound flight and turned over to the clean side for outbound flight. Not good for BC.

Fiji Airways customer review,8,2011-08-28,NAN to HNL on 737 aircraft. Served a cold dinner wrap (chicken or beef) on departure with a good selection of spirits and wine. However prior to arrival in Honolulu there was no breakfast offered - just a glass of watered down juice. This could be improved.

Fiji Airways customer review,,2011-07-31,On arrival at the airport 0900hrs we got behind a queue of more than 80 passengers and it did not move at all. After close up time at about 1115hrs an agent staff told passengers that the flight was full and all of us who were left behind had to be routed to either SYD MEL or overnight BNE to catch the following night's flight which was scheduled to depart at 2300hrs. The four of us opted for the overnight stay in BNE we eventually checked into the BNE (not NAN) hotel as it was 1445 which was supposed to have been the scheduled arriva of our flight at NAN. The airport representative knew of the change in the aircraft type and was not forthcoming in warning the passengers of the offloading. We were made to wait like cattle in the queue and eventually wasted five precious hours. Our flight was rebooked for the next night with meals accommodation and transport to and fro the airport. Vouchers refreshments were only handed to passengers after the 2 hours wait. Air Pacific staff should have adopted a positive attitude and taken advantage of the situation to provide a high standard of service with proper planning and execution to lessen the already inconvenienced passengers. Service on board was mediocre. With a flight of more than 3 hours from BNE/NAN a cold snack was inappropriate for a scheduled airline which charged international fares.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False

Fiji Airways customer review,7,2011-07-22,BNE-NAN on a 737-700 flight was delayed by over 3 hrs apparently due to a member of the crew calling in sick. Since we had come in on another flight from MEL we had little choice but to wait the 3+ hrs at Brisbane airport. Once we boarded we were given a very warm welcome by the flight crew. The aircraft's condition was satisfactory - not great but you can do a lot worse. Once in flight we were served breakfast consisting of tropical fruits orange juice and a cupcake. I did notice that when the head flight attendant spoke over the PA he would take frequent and long pauses which made him come across as nervous. The remainder of the flight went without a hitch and upon landing in Fiji the flight crew was once again very apologetic about the delay. Overall a nice experience (3 hr delay aside) and very good value for money.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Fiji Airways customer review,4,2011-07-15,"Air Pacific remains the least expensive way (usually) to travel NAD-LAX. But as noted by many others service is only barely adequate. Very few smiles no friendly words. Flight attendants appeared very bored with their jobs. (Big change from several years ago!) Economy seats are very uncomfortable for 11+ hr. (Probably okay for somebody under 30 but not for a mature person.) I don't understand their ""requirement"" to keep all shades shut as dawn over distant Hawaii can be spectacular and there's nobody out there to peep in! Aircraft interior appears aged with inadequate care. Customer Service (misnomer!) does not answer emailed questions (e.g. anticipated excess baggage limit/cost) despite giving that option. They also lie (or are completely ignorant of) seat selection policies assigning seats months ahead and then denying that possibility at check-in. This airline clearly has a near monopoly on their route (Qantas and Air New Zealand share the airplane and all its elements) and considers passengers as mere annoyances to collecting their salaries.

Of late I ensure that I have a meal before I board the flight and simply then try to sleep through the flight. This is because the service the meals in particular are unacceptable. Cold sandwiches on a ""full service"" airline? The fleet is also very old and Air Pacific have dreamt dreamliners are stuck with this old fleet. What that means is that ""on our all flights meals and handsets are complimentary"" spare us the headsets not worth watching or listening to.

First part of the flight was average Boeing 747 desperately needs renovation inside fittings broken sink in toilet smashed electrical and IFE problems stained curtains and upholstery seatbelt and smoking signs burnt out. Seat was quite comfortable and padded there was a flickering light above my seat cabin crew said that they couldn't turn it off. Instead they distributed eye masks but the FA refused to give me one as he thought that the light wasn't disturbing me. Even though I demanded one he refused. The food served was very poor. NAN-LAX flight at 2230 was delayed for 4 hours due to a mechanical fault and we were not allowed off the plane. LAX-NAN the already poor IFE failed to work I called the flight attendant who was rude and she said ""yeah it clearly doesn't work does it?"" then stormed off. She never returned to apologise for the issue that was only with 2 rows of seats. NAN-SYD the same aircraft with faulty IFE and even poorer food. A child in front was disturbing me so I asked to the flight attendant to ask them to stop. She walked off and never did a thing about it.

Fiji Airways customer review,8,2011-05-14,LAX-NAN-AKL. LAX check in friendly and helpful. Agent changed our seats on NAN-AKL leg as requested. Gave us a coupon for admission to the departure lounge at LAX which was well stocked with snacks and drinks . We flew business class and had seats in the first row of the B747-400. With the seat fully reclined there was still two feet of space in front of us. The business class section was very small for this airplane. Cabin service was friendly food pretty good. Entertainment system adequate. Newspapers available. Transferring from the 747 to NAN-AKL B767-300 involved walking a few hundred feet into the terminal building where our names were checked off on a roster then carry on bags put through the x-ray and hand searched thoroughly. This seemed a bit extreme as bottles of water given to us on the previous flight were taken away from us. This caused quite a bottleneck behind us as most passengers aboard were in transit. Any duty free liquor purchased in LAX and carried was taken by authorities in Nadi.

Fiji Airways customer review,,2011-04-27,Worst airline ever. Food terrible service only friendly on the surface. Onboard entertainment worst ever. not even a local newspaper. Nearly could not leave from Nadi to HKG because they told us that we need onward tickets from HKG which is rubbish when you are on transfer to Macao or the mainland. They forced us to buy an expensive ticket to Frankfurt (German passport holder/2000 Euros per ticket one way on a Cathay Pacific flight) and told me I could cancel it at their counter in Hong Kong. The staff refused talking to me and others and just said we would have to buy another ticket (with time running out and only 2 flights per week that are mostly sold out for several weeks). Some couples were left behind since they did not have the necessary funds available to do so. On Spanish couple started crying - can understand. At HKG it became clear that they do not have a ticket counter in all of HKG. They sent me to Cathay Pacific (partner airline) which explained that they are not responsible which made sense since Air Pacific received the money. Contacted the handling agent in HKG (only available Air Pacific contact in Hong Kong) and told me has to send copy of ticket to Fiji and it will take 3 months to refund me.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,1,2011-03-31,Nadi to Los Angeles as part of a round-the-world package with Air New Zealand. Paid for Premium Economy but automatically downgraded by Air Pacific to economy. Seats uncomfortable food dreadful entertainment system sub-standard. Worst of all Air Pacific would not honour the higher baggage allowance of Premium Economy so whole trip had to be planned around this leg. Told to confirm booking 24 hours in advance a practice I thought had stopped many years ago. When I asked about an upgrade I was told a 100 FJD rebooking fee was required plus the cost of the upgrade. As flight was an hour late leaving we were confined to a small hot area with no toilets and seating for about one third of passengers for over 2 hours.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,7,2011-02-19,LAX-NAN-BNE. I booked the ticket for a very good price at last minute and was not sure what to expect. Check in at LAX the toughest part - I am a professional musician and fly regularly with my instrument I was informed at the check-in desk that I would have to pay $50 USD for extra equipment and gate check the instrument as the flight was full and it wouldn't fit in the overheads on a 747-400. Check in clerk got the manager who advised me they would tag the instrument and if the flight crew deemed it too large than I would have to gate check it. This was great as I never have a problem with any flight crew and I know it fits in any over head locker it's smaller than most peoples carry on bags and very precious to me. LAX-NAN was fully booked and the overhead lockers were packed I did what I do every flight and presented myself at boarding at the front of the line secured my space in the overheads and took my seat we managed to fit everyone's carryon's from the row behind me my row and the row in front in the over head bin. The food was OK entertainment system was awful but I never use them. I did manage to catch a movie when I awoke 3 hours outside of Nadi they seemed to have got the system working by then. Seats were comfortable cabin crew friendly more so than Qantas. Nadi was unorganised with 3 departing transfer flights leaving at the same time roughly with one transfer desk with two staff for everyone. I think the entire 747 was transferring. There was also another security check point after the transfer desk which I thought was strange. NAN-BNE was great on time and no problems on a 737 had an entire row to myself on a 4 hr flight! I didn't bother with the entertainment again as I stretched out and slept the duration of the flight. Got all my luggage with no problems walked straight out onto the street and into the car. Cheap good Service excellent flight crew good friendly cabin crew on time and spacious. Against - charges for equipment despite it being my carry on. Food only OK Entertainment system poor. Management staff at LAX not the best and not that friendly. Will fly with them again if they are the cheapest.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Fiji Airways customer review,4,2011-02-04,"Sydney to Nadi. Would say crew were friendly but need to smile a bit more as their slogan says ""the worlds friendliest airline"". I had flown Air Pacific several times mostly in economy class but have found some serious cost-cutting. The lunch served was shocking 1 packet of cheap crisp 1 packet of local savoury bhuja mix and a chicken roll on sweet bread which was disgusting. They still charge a high fare price but customer care is very poor.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,8,2011-01-31,Business Class SYD-NAN. Seats are very old although we found them quite comfortable for a short trip to Nadi. Service was excellent and food fantastic. Old IFE and very small screens. Great value for money and would fly them again.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Fiji Airways customer review,7,2010-10-28,Air Pacific economy SYD-NAN-HNL and LAX-NAN-SYD. SYD-NAN on 747 was reasonable. Hot lunch served with beverages. Seats reasonably comfortable. FAs quite pleasant. FAs asked passengers to return seats to upright position during mealtimes which I appreciated. NAN-HNL on 737 a small plane for an 8-hour flight. FAs wonderful with humour and a smile. Food was okay hot breakfast before arrival in HNL. LAX-NAN on 747. Check-in LAX was quick counters opened nearly 4 hours before flight time. Service superb meals a bit disappointing for an overnight flight. Transfer in NAN was chaotic and departure lounge at NAN is way too small. One set of toilets for 4 flights in departure lounge. NAN-SYD standard of service dropped markedly. Crew couldn't wait to get to SYD. Overall we found our Air Pacific experience on 4 flights to be positive.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Fiji Airways customer review,3,2010-10-03,AKL-NAN-AKL Economy class. World's friendliest airline? We didn't get one smile the whole trip! The one and only smile we actually got was from the Air New Zealand check in clerk in Auckland. B767 terribly old seat was lumpy and had a dip in it so was very hard to get comfortable. Food very poor and not enough. Crew unfriendly and seemed uninterested the whole flight. On the way up there were passengers standing in the cabin talking to each other across the seats drinking as if they were in a pub. Cabin crew did nothing about it. Way back was a surprisingly spacious B737-700. Same as flight up - food disappointing crew unfriendly. Although I am not a fan of Air NZ at all I will certainly pay the extra to fly them next time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,2,2010-09-30,Melbourne to Nadi return My wife and I bought Qantas Business class flights and were given Air Pacific to fly on - had I known I would not have flown The seats were large and fairly comfortable but not up to Business Class standards nothing on the flight was up to standard and I have written a formal letter of Complaint to Qantas as their codeshare partner is well below the business class that I expected. I would only recommend this airline if Air Pacific changed their class to Premium Economy as Business Class is way off the mark in their case.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,7,2010-09-26,AKL-NAN September B737-700 clean. Cabin crew indifferent. Cabin Manager friendly and chatty. Excellent welcome on board. Meal was cold and was a hamburger bun with chicken and salad a small pack of potato chips and two biscuits. Vegetarian option available. Free wine available. IFE drop down screens and showing was a documentary. Overall a pleasant flight. Old 767-300 on the way home. Clean and tidy. Continental breakfast was muesli fresh fruit coconut cake tea or coffee and orange juice. Was very tasty. Staff okay. When offering water later on in flight cabin manager flew through the cabin with glasses and water so no opportunity to ask for drink at that time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Fiji Airways customer review,,2010-09-02,Booked a flight from Malololailai to Taveuni via Nadi for part of my honeymoon trip. We checked online the day before to ensure everything was on time and got confirmation that we were good to go. On the day of we headed over to Malololailai only to be told that Air Pacific / Pacific Sun are no longer flying from there. We then proceeded to get a boat and taxi to Nadi but still missed our connection flight from Nadi to Taveuni. Air Pacific told us that they notified us but they did not. We were stuck in Nadi until the next day for the next Taveuni flight. Air Pacific didn't even offer to put us in a hotel for the night. I'm speechless about the whole event. All I can say is if you have a choice choose another airline. Its not worth risking your vacation.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,8,2010-08-26,SYD-NAN return B744 Service. Overall an excellent experience. Crew gracious and attentive yet unobtrusive and kept drinks refreshed. The seats are showing their age but I find the old wide and padded cradle seats quite comfortable especially for short haul international flights. AV is poor - not AVOD and screens are so small. Meals were of an economy class standard but served with business class service. For the price - would do it again.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Fiji Airways customer review,7,2010-08-02,BNE-NAN-BNE Business Class. Flight departing BNE comfortable enough but dated Business Class seats and older plane. Food was excellent and customer service good outward and return. Good IFE with a portable movie player. It seems when things go well they go well but when things go wrong it seems disastrous!,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Fiji Airways customer review,,2010-07-24,We were a group of 7 flying Business class from NAN-HKG. Upon check in shocked to be told that the flight was cancelled. No one called us beforehand. Total chaos at the airport and apparently there were other flights to MEL and SYD from a day before that were also cancelled due to technical reasons. Total incompetence prevailed and just 1 staff serving a huge line of pax at the service desk. Absolutely no consideration or preference for premium fare pax. Not for all the money would I ever fly this airline again or recommend it to anyone.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Fiji Airways customer review,6,2010-06-30,SYD-NAN in economy and NAN-LAX in business class. Air Pacific economy is rudimentary and that's putting it politely. There is an extra inch of legroom over most other airlines' economy classes but that's where the superiority ends. One major bugbear was the time it took to collect the trays after dinner - a full two hours after putting them in front of us. Dinner itself was less-than-ordinary pasta made with mystery-meat. Wines were the cheapest bulk-buy available. IFE was a tiny screen with a serious colour-balance and contrast problem but it worked in the front economy cabin unlike the seats down the back. The staff were pleasant and polite but I got the impression they felt intimidated by the passengers. Air Pacific economy is pretty awful. Air Pacific business class is a throwback to the early 1990's but it's much better than their economy. The cabin is in the nose of the 747. Seats recline to about 150 degrees. Food quite good - delicious fried-rice snack on departure from Nadi and a huge breakfast before arrival at Los Angeles. Breakfast was substantially larger and tastier than the offering in Qantas business a couple of weeks later. The FA who looked after Biz on our flight was charming and professional. We arrived on time at LAX and unfortunately we parked at a remote gate so disembarking before the economy passengers was of no benefit. I was happy with Air Pacific biz and for the bargain-basement fare we paid it was great value for money. Economy was not great though which markedly effects my overall score.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
