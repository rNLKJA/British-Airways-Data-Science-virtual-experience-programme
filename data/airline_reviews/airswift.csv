"""crews and ground staff friendly""",7,2018-05-26,"Manila to El Nido. AirSWIFT is a Philippine boutique airline offering daily roundtrip flights from Manila to El Nido. And this is the only way to go to El Nido. If you book any property of the El Nido Resorts, you would get a discount on its flight. And there is also a VIP lounge for guests of El Nido Resorts in the airport. They fly AT4, a very old plane. Do not expect to have much service in this short one hour ride. Of course also no any entertainment. But the crews and ground staff are friendly.",True,AT4,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manila to El Nido,February 2018,3,4,,4,3,,True
