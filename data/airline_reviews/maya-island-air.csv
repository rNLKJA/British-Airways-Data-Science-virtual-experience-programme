"""would only offer usage of our tickets for a 2 year period""",1,2021-09-08,Not Verified |  We cancelled our flight tickets because of Covid and the increasing numbers in Belize 2 months in advance of our trip. The airline would only offer usage of our tickets for a 2 year period rather than fully refunding the ticket price. I can understand this for a late cancellation but not in this situation.

"""1950’s era third world airline""",1,2020-03-01,San Pedro to Belize City. Enjoy the experience of a 1950’s era third world airline. Reservations and confirmations mean nothing. Your flight will always be leaving in 15 minutes and passengers cheer when they are finally called to board. Particularly difficult on families with children. Officials sit inscrutably at the front desk and must be approached numerous times to ensure you have not lost you place in line. Really great way to start and end a vacation.,True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Pedro to Belize City,February 2020,2,1,,1,1,,False
