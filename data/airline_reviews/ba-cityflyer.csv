LCY is so easy to get through in arrival and I was on the DLR to the city in 10 minutes flat. A great start to the day. Returning home on Oct 3 at the 14:40 on the smaller EMB170 was much less comfortable due to turbulence for at least 20mins thanks to the tail of a US hurricane passing over GB.

Traveling to Rotterdam The Haque Airport is pretty doable by public transport from Rotterdam Central Station or The Hague Central Station by bus and/or underground. Once arrived, I went straight to check-in my luggage which was fast and efficient as there was literally no queuing time. After passing the usual struggle at security I had a hour left before boarding starts. Due to work in progress on Rotterdam's terminal, there wasn't much to do (wifi was fast and constant though with lots of seating areas). Boarding was done in a nice and efficient way, however what do you expect of only boarding approximately thirty people? The cabin was comfortable. Plenty of legroom, leather seats and a good view in front of the wing, however I'd like to note that it would have been better if they actually replaced their magazine and safety card by a new one as the current one was in a very very poor state. Departed on time, it was a pretty short and straight leg with the pilot informing us several times with departure, arrival and weather information and 15 minutes into flight, the flight attendants served us a pretty limited service for British Airways terms (might had to do with a short flight of only 55 minutes), which included a drink of choice and a biscuit or chips. Once arrived with a not so smooth landing, the plane was quickly parked and deboarding started within a few minutes.

I've noticed that so many complaints seem to be over problems caused by missed connections due to delays caused by air traffic issues or bad weather, or both. The Golden Rule is simple! - never trust the short transfer and connection times between flights listed on airline web sites or suggested by some travel agents - its just not worth the hassle these days, even if that means staying overnight at an airport hotel for your next flight, especially if that is long-haul or vv. Anyway, I allowed many hours between my flights through London City (a delightful little airport) and was also able to fit in a business meeting at the airport. BA City Flyer flights on the smaller EMB190 jet are excellent.

BA CityFlyer customer review,9,2014-10-12,RTM-LCY. The lunchtime flight departed Rotterdam precisely on time. The aircraft has 2x2 seating with sufficient underseat space for hand luggage and a table big enough to work on with a laptop. Although small the Embraer 170 aircraft newly deployed on this route feels agile spacious and comfortable. Despite rough weather on the approach into LCY the flight arrived ahead of schedule. Service on board was highly professional with all passengers receiving complimentary drinks and snacks. The RTM-LCY service is a great way to avoid the crowds and queues of Heathrow and Schiphol.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,8,2014-09-09,"EDI-LCY on 31/08/14 and LCY-EDI on 03/09/14. The flights both ways on Embraer 190s were excellent but BA's customer service at LCY was less than impressive. There had been issues with low visibility at LCY on the morning of 03/09. After checking in at one of the machines I was walking past the BA customer service desk and noticed that two employees were sitting chatting to each other. I approached them and once they'd actually stopped chatting I asked if there was likely to be a delay to BA8716. Them: ""What makes you think it might be delayed?"" Me: ""Well there were lots of inbound delays earlier today"". Them: ""Not got a clue"". No I'm not making that up. As it turned out BA8716 left bang on time and I have no complaint on that score but being told that customer service ""haven't a clue"" about the departure time of a flight due out in a little over an hour really isn't good enough.",False,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,10,2014-09-01,"Used BA frequently to Frankfurt the last 6 months. Really friendly staff. Seats or OK given that I’m 6'7"". Price is OK and it is value for money. Also travelling in an out of LCY rather than Heathrow is a bonus. No M25!",False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,10,2014-06-04,AMS-LCY on EMB190. These aircraft's are great for European flights 2x2 seating plenty of leg room. Good service beer and snack on 40 minute flight. London City is a breeze at Victoria station within 30 minutes of landing.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,10,2014-06-01,LCY-GLA/EDI-LCY - UK Domestic (there is one class only on UK Domestic flights). LCY is a favourite airport but having to tag your own bag before getting to the check in desk is annoying. Great smiling crews on both legs but the EDI crew were particularly very happy and jovial not bad considering it was a Sunday lunchtime flight down. Love the Embraer jets for the 2-2 seating which makes for a comfortable journey. On time departures and arrivals on both flights. Seating good and space adequate. Drinks and snacks ok but for the lunch time return it would have been nicer to have had a wrap or sandwich instead of just a small packet of crisps or cookies - although the Lilly O'Brien's chocolate shortbread was rather decadent! Well done BA!,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,8,2014-05-28,RTM-LCY. Short 40-minute flight in Saab 2000 turboprop operated by Eastern Airways. 1+2 seating with good seat pitch. Boarded by bus. In-flight service was to BA standard: full meal tray for Club pax drinks and snacks for Economy. No cabin separation. Limited bin space for bags but enough under-seat space. Only discernible non-BA feature was ban on mobiles throughout flight. Good value.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,6,2014-01-14,AGP to LCY one-way. I occasionally upgrade to Business Class to get lounge access and - most important for me - more space. The E190 which BA Cityflyer operates on this route has good seat pitch and comfortable seats but the 2x2 arrangement means that you'll be sitting next to someone on a busy flight which mine was (I was travelling alone). I have no complaints about the service and the food though I'd mention that I was the third person to be served the meal and the last person to have a choice. The lounge at Malaga is spacious and plenty to drink but little food. and the Wi-Fi didn't work. Not a bad experience overall but the lack of space in Business was a major disappointment and I won't be using again if travelling alone.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,5,,,3,,False,
BA CityFlyer customer review,7,2013-10-25,Flew on new BA route to Granada from LCY on 6 Sep. Appalling organisation at the check-in area. Total chaos. Stood in bag drop queue for solid 30 minutes. Slow security resulted in nearly missing flight despite being at airport well over an hour before departure.. Pouring with rain - no air bridge - we boarded plane to be told by pilot that the airport system to calculate weight of bags had failed and he was doing it manually. He was a bit concerned as we near our maximum weight. Hardly reassuring. Plane eventually took off 50 minutes late and faced strong head winds through France resulting in an hour's delay vs hour landing time. Crew made up for it by offering excellent service. Flight back much better - still an hour late but less people and totally relaxing. Inflight catering much better than LGW.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,9,2013-10-25,FRA-LCY-FRA on excellent BA Cityflyer - what a pleasant experience! flights in Business/Club Europe fairly lightly booked and very good value if one chooses carefully. Meals wine and close to on-time performance out of Docklands (which is such a classy little airport in downtown London) made for such a better experience than slogging through Heathrow. I enjoy the smaller Embraer aircraft and sense of personal service on BA Cityflyer.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,,2013-09-16,Flew economy from London City to Mahon Menorca on 6th Sept. Flight was overbooked so some people got bumped off and flight was delayed 1 hr 30 mins whilst they tried to sort it all out. Had to stand in very crowded gate area whilst this was going on. Staff attitude was appalling and they told a different story re overbooking to the one the pilot gave on the plane - so who was telling the truth? On arrival in Mahon discovered our luggage had never been put on the plane. Luggage was then supposed to arrive the following day but this was cancelled and it was then moved to yet another flight and didn't arrive in Mahon until late Sunday night. However still wasn't delivered to our hotel until Monday night at 8.30pm. First trip with BA since early 90s and vowed then not to use BA again as the flight was so bad surly unhelpful crew etc. We fly at least 3 or more times a year and find that Middle East airlines and Virgin are far far better in terms of customer service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,1,,False,
BA CityFlyer customer review,9,2013-09-12,LCY to Mahon in Euro Traveller. On time arrivals and early departures in both directions. The E190 is a great plane with comfy seats and great leg room. Cabin staff were competent and polite and nothing else. Unfortunately the food offering on the O/W leg has been reduced from a cooked breakfast (0945 departure) to a tiny roll (Tuna Tuna or Tuna) and a one fingered kitkat. (Chicken chicken or chicken on the return). One bar service in both directions but a second drink provided when asked for. Its a shame the Mahon route isn't all year round but it continues to provide a great way to start and finish a holiday in Menorca.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,3,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,10,2013-08-26,Flew out of LCY to Menorca on 9th August and back on 23rd August. Excellent service and fantastic legroom in euro traveller. All the benefits of free hold luggage and good hand luggage allowance. On board snack and drink also supplied within ticket price.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,10,2013-07-01,LCY-BCN-LCY. on CE. I love LCY as you don't have to walk for miles. You come off the DLR down to the check in desk. Because we were flying Club Europe we were able to the use the dedicated check in desk so that was quick. Security was very quick and friendly. They seem to have even more security zones than my last trip. No lounges at LCY. Boarding was on time but no priority for CE pax or OW elites. However given as they board from the back and front of the plane it didn't mater. On board the 2 crew worked hard delivering the breakfast meals out to a full plane load. Nice product but the eggs were are bit crumbly. Arrived on time but bags took a while to come out with no priority. Return journey from BCN was good. Check in a breeze. Sala Miro lounge to wait in but being on the cusp of lunch there wasn't much in the way of fresh food about. Boarding was done by cabin/status. Not as full as before - 6 in CE only. Both meal options were salads ie fish or meat on rocket with some other little bits. Could have done with more leaves and some vegetables! Dessert was some cream concoction imitating an Eton mess. The crew were good and even offered their meal to a pax that didn't fancy the options. Bags at City came out in some order ie some priority bags then standard then a few more priority. Still a quick airport to exit. Shame BA is cancelling the LCY - BCN flights from August. I hope they bring them back.,False,,,Business Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,6,2013-04-16,LCY-AMS-LCY for a weekend break. Flight delayed and then cancelled subsequent flight delayed again aircraft changed and departed 3 hours late. No communication from ground staff. Flight home on time. Excellent cabin service in Club Europe with light meal served. Cabin crew excellent on both sectors. Will choose again as normally excellent service from LCY - will put it down to BA Cityflyer having a bad day.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,8,2013-03-21,Travelled London City/Palma and return 7th-14th March. Both flights on time and comfortable. Pre-flight announcements from flight deck on return journey concise yet full clear and with touch informality that gained attention. Cabin service sound and hot breakfast on outward journey quite acceptable. The 'snack' on return journey eminently missable: best option is to eat to your choice at Palma airport.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,10,2012-10-09,EDI-LCY return in one day. I was expecting delays and various other bumps along the way as it was the height of the London Olympic games but everything went smoothly. Edinburgh airport is run well with the exception of beings bussed to the E190. Onboard the aircraft was clean bright and modern. Inflight service included a round of drinks and a light snack which is more that sufficient for an hour and 15 minute flight. The return flight that evening was just as good. This time a short walk across the apron to our E170 and onboard again clean and comfortable. Inflight service of drinks and warm snacks suitable for the evening shuttle. I was lucky in having Row 01 seats on both legs so amply leg room.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,4,2012-08-21,Flight crew are helpful and friendly but BA’s airport facilities are lacking! As this is a BA CityFlyer (only a subsidiary of BA) you don't get many of the advertised (and paid for) benefits of flying BA Club Europe. No Lounge no dedicated check in no priority boarding no fast track through security no priority baggage handling no choice of meal inflight. On wet days expect to get wet at London City the planes wait in stands away from the airport building and BA do not offer umbrellas etc. Once boarded the plane we were too full to take off on a wet runway had to wait for over an hour BA while ground crew worked out who had to be asked to disembark from the flight – could only imagine how stressed I would have been if I was actually flying from this airport on business. All other airlines seemed to be taking off okay but i did not see 1 BA flight take off while we were grounded.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
BA CityFlyer customer review,8,2012-07-25,London City to Mahon and Madrid back into City. No delay at check in and a breeze through security. 15 mins delayed departing LCY with no explanation from ground staff who just seemed slow. An ok hot breakfast and tea / coffee was welcome though I was surprised that there was no bar service after the meal was served. Return from Madrid was delayed an hour due to the flight deck walk around finding a scrape which needed checking out. A drink from the bar was fine but a 18 gram bag of savoury snacks is an insult. City flyer remains superior to flying BA from Heathrow mainly due to the E190 being a spacious and new plane. However with a bit of effort BA could achieve a better level of service - especially around catering.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,10,2012-07-16,LCY-BCN-LCY. As usual cannot fault this airline and its service. Passed through LCY with no problems and boarded the spotlessly clean Embraer 190 on time. Welcomed on both sectors by a friendly smart and efficient cabin crew. Surprised to receive a full hot English breakfast which was most welcome followed by a complementary bar service. Will most certainly use this airport/airline more often where possible. Anything to cut out LGW/LHR.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,8,2012-05-22,LCY-EDI-LCY operated by BA Cityflyer. Excellent flights on the Embraer E170 (out) E190 (back). On time departure and early arrivals on both legs. Complimentary hot breakfast on outbound leg (passable at best) bar service with a sweet or salty snack on the return more than enough for the 1 hour 10 minute flight. Friendly crew nice modern jets. LCY was busy on the outbound but the airport had opened the overflow (ie former) screening haul and it took all of 10 minutes from DLR to airside. Edinburgh busy on the return but queues well managed. Accessed BA Terraces lounge in Edinburgh courtesy of my Gold card with Cathay Pacific which was uncrowded with a reasonable selection of food and drink. All in all very good.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,10,2012-04-16,Barcelona to LCY. Used at the end of a 29 day cruise. A modern Embraer 170 2+2 seating which is a major plus. More than adequate legroom and no pressure on overhead storage. Very attentive purser in particular. Food only a snack but more than adequate for short flight. Prompt departure and on time arrival. Quickly through immigration and onto car.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,7,2011-11-29,AGP-LCY Economy. Fast check-in no queues at Malaga. Bus to aircraft (personal hate) but sent off buses quickly without cramming them full. New clean Embraer 190 plenty of legroom but storing hand luggage was a problem. Helpful professional cabin crew. Nice sandwich and a drink. Time to do some work before descending into LCY. Confusion with steps on landing had to wait 10 mins on board before disembarking. Good value for money given that no extra's had to be paid for compared to low cost airlines.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,5,2011-11-24,FRA-LCY. Took off nearly an hour late in Frankfurt due to weather flight uneventful until about 10 mins before landing had to do a missed approach due to bad fog. Had to divert to BHX and waited an hour for a coach to LCY arriving at 12.30am when we should have arrived at 6.40pm. Very frustrating although not BA Cityflyer's fault. Its put me off using LCY as an airport due to its small size and how the weather affects it.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,8,2011-09-15,Checked in at Glasgow International Airport at 09.30am to catch the flight to Naples. Once onboard we were told that the trolley with hot paninis drinks etc would shortly be coming through the aircraft. Perhaps one quarter to one third of passengers at the front of the plane were served hot paninis the only hot or substantial food offered. Minutes later it was announced with apologies that the paninis were finished and that the only food available were muffins and pringles. This flight over lunchtime and lasting just over 3 hrs had run out of hot snacks - absolutely hopeless. The amount of legroom and the 2 seats rather than the usual 3 seats together was greatly appreciated and the efficiency and cheerfulness of the cabin staff was excellent. Same on the return one week later cabin crew were wonderful but could only offer apologies for not accepting Euros. We had no sterling so had to do without for the 3 hr trip - the stewardess gave my husband and me a small bottle of water each and 2 small packets of biscuits out of her own allowance. Take off times and landings were on time and no complaints there. Would definitely use Cityflyer again but please consider taking Euros for payment of food and drinks on board and make sure there is enough hot food on board for all passengers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,10,2011-08-17,Flew MAD-LCY. An excellent experience. Great legroom spacious cabin with 2-2 seating configuration. Service was professional with smiles. Will definitely fly them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,5,2011-07-11,Barcelona-London City. Check in smooth. Slightly overweight luggage accepted with no extra charges. Boarding was good and departure punctual. Aircraft an E90 felt roomy although the placement of armrests was anything but comfortable and my arms kept falling asleep. Crew was jolly and seemed to enjoy their work. Inflight service was the bare minimum consisted of a single beverage run only and choice of biscuits or granola bars. Arrival was an absolute nightmare: London City airport closed the runway during our approach apparently due to a bird strike. Ended up in a dizzying holding pattern for more than 30mins which made some passengers ill. Pilot finally decided to divert to London Stansted the absolute furthest airport from the city. Was told buses would take us into London. After more than 1hr of sitting on the ground with no offer of water or any other service from crew and at first being told that buses were being organized and we would be on our way shortly pilot finally told us we would be taking off and heading for London City as they had reopened the runway. Finally arrived at our destination 2 hrs behind schedule having only had a small cup of tea in the more than 4 hrs since we left Barcelona. The runway closure was of course not BA's fault but all in all not a very pleasant experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,9,2011-06-06,GLA-LCY E-190 aircraft. Very full flight but cabin service was excellent and friendly and the flight both punctual and enjoyable. Would highly recommend BA Cityflyer to London City very quick and efficient connections to city.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,2,2011-04-26,LCY-MAD Embraer 190. Business class but not so you'd notice! What you don't get : advance seat selection (only option is to check-in online 24 hours in advance to discover that others have somehow managed to get in before you) priority check-in fast track security (doesn't exist) Lounge none no Priority boarding. So you've boarded the aircraft and there's not been a jot of difference travelling business class. Board the aircraft and you sit in exactly the same seat as everyone else but yours has a headrest cover!. Arrive at Madrid and your bags come off last. What you get : a hot meal but no choice of menu - stewardess walked down the aisle telling everyone that the menu was 'steak and potatoes' (actually lamb).,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
BA CityFlyer customer review,10,2011-03-14,LCY-ARN. Outstanding economy service. Brand new E170 jet with leather seats. The hard working and pleasant two man cabin crew served a hot English breakfast coffee and then bar service twice on the 2h 30m trip (aided by plane being only about 70% full). 10 minute late departure might not have raised an eyebrow at Heathrow but the LCY ground staff apologised and the crew made it up en route.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,8,2011-01-02,LCY-GLA-LCY return. New Embraer 170 excellent and comfortable flight. Heavy fog caused flight to be diverted to London Stansted on return trip obviously outside airline's control but meant long delay in waiting for coach transfer back to London City. Everything well organised although we had to wait for passengers from a second diverted flight to also arrive and join the coach transfer across town. Whilst inconvenient there was realistically nothing that airline could have done about the situation. Flights good transfer a bit slow.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,

BA CityFlyer customer review,10,2010-07-06,The new Embraer fleet is excellent 2x2 leather seating. Staff helpful so far every flight has been on time and City Airport is brilliant. I checked in for my flight to Zurich last week 12 minutes before the flight and they still let me on. Noticed the pilots have made a point of the fact that Cityflyer is not mainline BA therefore they're not subject to the strike action so I've been booking upcoming trips with them with confidence.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,8,2010-05-26,MAD-LCY Flew in C class mainly to use Iberia lounge at Terminal 4S which has excellent work facilities as well as hot food and genuinely high-quality wines. Boarding the 70-seat Embraer E-170 was swift and efficient. Business cabin (2+2) was comfortable with decent seat pitch. Food and drink adequate but not exceptional. Deplaning at LCY as efficient as ever. CityFlyer is a useful alternative to the major airports for Spanish routes which the airline is expanding this year.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,8,2010-03-04,EDI-LCY on time. E170 comfortable like the 2x2 seating free bar and some snacks although the FA missed me and my neighbour. I chose with route as I thought of the connections to London Bridge station I must say the DLR and particularly the Jubilee line was rather slow - I figured it might have been quicker to go via LGW.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
BA CityFlyer customer review,1,2010-03-01,GLA-LCY-GLA return with BA Cityflyer. Return flight was cancelled due to bad weather at LCY. BA offered us nothing apart from rebooked us on the next flight out of London airports. Hotels near LCY fully booked so I opted for earliest flight departing from LHR at 0705 rather than spend a night in the expensive hotel in the city centre. I have to make my way to LHR at my own expense. BA have definitely failed in term of customer services and I would not choose to fly with them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
BA CityFlyer customer review,9,2010-02-22,London City - Madrid return in economy. New Embraer 170 fleet from City airport. The experience was excellent. Check-in seamless. Cabin clean seats wide legroom good. Very spacious feel although stowage room for hand luggage still rather limited. Service was excellent - a hot breakfast provided on the way out which was a pleasant surprise. Both flights on time and the captain kept pax informed. Good value for money and no obvious cutbacks noticed. As an executive club silver member lounge access in Madrid and free preseating is much appreciated - although check-in online free seating policy I believe works fine. Would fly with BA from city again and recommend them.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
