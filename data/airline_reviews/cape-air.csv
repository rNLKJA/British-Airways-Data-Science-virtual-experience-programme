"""Cape Air is not dependable""",5,2019-12-14,"Boston to Rutland. This airline should change its name to something more descriptive such as “50/50 Air”, I travel for business and have done my best to work around the fact that Cape Air is not dependable. Unfortunately, as a business traveler, a tax payer, and a person who wants to promote the greater Rutland area of Vermont as a great place to live and work, Cape Air is NOT an asset. They are consistently late, often unable to fly due to seemingly mild weather issues, and often challenged by weight limits ( meaning passengers with paid tickets get bumped because another passengers luggage was too heavy ). The federal government subsidizes Cape Air almost $200 per passenger for Rutland, plus whatever Cape Air charges per ticket. Tonight I got bumped due to Cape Air accepting other passengers with too much luggage, so Cape Air, with YOUR TAX DOLLARS, had a driver deliver me from Boston to Rutland (3.5 hours) in an attempt to make up for their poor planning and tiny planes. At a minimum, the airline should set a weight limit for passengers and luggage, and for those that travel heavy, force them to buy a second ticket to cover the extra baggage weight. Long story short, Rutland needs a new airline, with larger planes capable of handling more passengers and cargo. Local, state and federal authorities need to do more homework and see that many folks traveling from Rutland drive to Burlington, Albany, and Hartford to catch flights.

"""this was a nightmare""",1,2017-06-20,"✅ Verified Review | Cape Air canceled both of our flights between Saranac Lake, NY and Boston.

But on the way home to Saranac Lake, they canceled our flight from BOS at the last minute while we were waiting at the gate. Their solution to cancelling our Saranac Lake flight was to rebook us into Plattsburgh (a 1+ hr drive away from Saranac Lake) and book a driver to take us from Plattsburgh Airport to Saranac Lake airport (where we had all left our cars). Sounds good but we got into the Plattsburgh Airport and there was NO driver. It was late, the rental car desks were closed. We were on the phone with Cape Air reps for over an hour - none of whom offered any solution. Finally, but sheer luck, a taxi driver pulled up to the airport and found us there. We had to hire him to drive us to Saranac Lake airport and pay the cost. Cape Air says to fill out multiple forms, attach receipts, etc... and they will reimburse us the taxi fare.

Once I scheduled the first flight back to Nantucket because I was coming in on a red eye, they didn't run that flight and gave no reason, I had to wait another 2 hours. Recently when they changed over their computer system somehow my reservation 'froze' and they could not let me on the plane. I waited while two schedule flights left and had to buy another ticket just to get to Boston, to miss the event I was trying to attend. I could not believe that this company would set up their employees for such failure with this new computer system. No one was trained to operate the computer and it was a complete disaster. And this last time I was delayed due to fog in NY and even though I made it on time they had sent that plane early. Sent early despite knowledge of the east coast weather and despite the fact they didn't offer another flight for 3 hours. You may be asking yourself, ""Why would this lady keep flying Cape Air?"" Well the answer is there is not any competition for this airline and they will treat you as such. Because what can we do as a customer when there is no other option?  What do they have to offer an an apology or reconciliation for their poor service - nothing! The staff could not have cared less about my reservation or predicament. I have never been treated so poorly by a company over and over. The Cape Air website speaks of great customer service and quality but that is obviously just a cloak for their poor customer service practices and obvious lack of concern for any of their patrons.

Major pain for frequent flyers. Of course this means you won't know your gate, gate changes, flight status updates. You must go through security twice. When you fly into Logan you need a long layover time because you have to change terminals and go through security. The stated times on their site is ""Wheels up"" the flights will take off early. Today I freely admit I arrived late to Augusta airport (size of my living room). The plane is boarding and appears only 1 person on the entire plane. They refuse to check me (remember no such thing as precheck on this flight and your connection). The plane is still open. It is 15 minutes before the scheduled departure and the plane leaves. I have one bag no check in, and there is no one boarding it would have taken 2 minutes and the plane still could have left 10 minutes. Insult to injury they refuse to help with connecting flights. They can but will not. The person told me if they have an issue they will help, but if it is your issue you are on your own. So why bother? Portland is an hour away and is a real airport.

Cape Air customer review,,2013-09-09,I was bumped from a flight Rutland VT to Boston and almost no effort was made by the person in charge to find a volunteer who could take a later flight. Be aware that they can bump people due to weight issues on the plane (people had a lot of luggage apparently and I was told the flight would have been 80 pounds over the limit if the plane had flown with the normal number of passengers that day - they were not even overbooked). My understanding is there is no limit to their ability to bump for this reason and they don't need to pay any compensation whatsoever. I was headed to Boston to make a connection to MN. The woman in charge seemed unconcerned and thought that since she could fly me from a NH airport departing much later and have me arrive in time to run to my connection there was no harm done. I explained to her that I was sick and mobility and energy were issues at that point she offered to set up a wheelchair for me in Boston. My experience with Cape Air tells me they are mostly nice people but I would never rely on them again in any situation where arrival at destination on time is important.

Had this flight been cancelled in Rockland and I could not connect my flight in Boston I would have been out several hundred's of dollars and United will not give refunds.
