The accompaniment of hash browns were soggy because chef in his wisdom had them up against cabbage...which of course is wet. So a main of a sausage, wet hash browns and cabbage.

A two type wine selection for Red and white....no quality spirits...no dessert wine. No cheese board for after. The IFE is dated with a very small selection.

FA didn't say much and kept saying that we will know more once on ground. That was a LIE!! 0 out of 10 in terms of taking responsibilities.

My review is in connection with the long-haul flights between Cape Town and Zurich. Edelweiss is overall a good carrier. The aircraft was new, clean and engendered trust in the airline, however there are two points which the airline has to improve upon: Accommodating babies. On the Cape Town to Zurich leg, there was insufficient time to book a seat at the bulkhead with a Bassinet, however the Cape Town ground crew assisted us and upgraded us to 'Economy Max' which provided us with bulkhead seating and a bassinet for our baby to sleep in, which was appreciated and not expected. However upon our return trip, which ironically was when we had the foresight to try to book a bulkhead seat in normal economy, we found that in trying to book a bulkhead seat and a bassinet (both on the website and via email correspondence) ,the airline did not accommodate us. We even paid 58CHF to secure 2 seats, however there were no bulkhead seats available and NO provision for parents with babies who actually need those bulkhead seats due to the bassinet facilities. Upon arrival at both Barcelona and Zurich Airports - on return to Cape Town - the ground crew would not or could not help us. We therefore had to travel 12 hours with a baby on our lap between Zurich and Cape Town and noted that the bulkhead seats were not occupied by people with babies. A most uncomfortable arrangement, with airline crew not assisting in making it any more easy for us or offering more suitable seating with a bassinet. It is totally unacceptable that no provision is made for booking with infants on the website or via email. We did send an email about 3 days prior to our trip, but this was only answered upon retuning to Cape Town. Not acceptable. The boarding system is chaotic. Not only in Cape Town, but Barcelona and Zurich. Everyone rushes at the same time to board the aircraft upon announcement of boarding. Why does the airline not look at what Singapore Airlines or other airlines do in boarding in a systematic and orderly fashion - thereby reducing an anxious and chaotic boarding process. They are a Swiss Airline after all - one would expect it! Ironically, upon getting into the aircraft, the aircrew constantly harass passengers with an announcement basically saying that passengers much step aside and get in their seats as soon as possible to allow other passengers to board. Surely if they instituted an orderly boarding system, this would actually be far more efficient, and this announcement would be unnecessary?",True,A340-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Barcelona to Cape Town via Zurich,November 2017,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",3,2,,True,

Edelweiss Air customer review,10,2010-08-31,Excellent economy class (PUJ-ZRH) - food service & seats are excellent. Service and comfort better than Swiss aircraft. Business class (ZRH-PUJ) not bad but only in first row! If you fly on Edelweiss Air (A330-200) no sense to pay extra money for business.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Edelweiss Air customer review,10,2009-08-24,Since Swissair collapsed have had to fly from Larnaca (Cyprus) to Zurich with Austria Airlines via Vienna so were very pleased to be able to fly direct once again with Edelweiss Air. Excellent flights both ways with first class service and friendly crew. Both flights arrived early. Hope Edelweiss/Swiss continue this route next summer.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,

Edelweiss Air customer review,7,2009-02-23,"ZRH-CUN-ZRH. The onward Economy flight was just great. Seats were a bit worn but comfy. The Inflight Entertainment consists only of some audio channels. No individual screens so no individual movies no games just two movies on the big screens - unsatisfactory. But the food was great a tasty main dish and lots of ice cream and sandwiches during the flight. Also the crew was friendly and efficient. I consider the inflight economy product on Edelweiss apart from the in-flight entertainment better than the Swiss economy on long haul. But definitely not so the ""Relax"" Class on the return flight which is also sold by Swiss as Business Class. We decided to do so because the flight back was a night flight and we wanted to sleep - it's a complete waste of money. There was separate and fast check-in at Cancun but we had the same latest check-in time than economy what a joke. When we asked for the lounge we were told that there wasn't any for Edelweiss Passengers. That definitely was not a joke. Once aboard the seats looked like old economy seats some 30 years ago. Small ridiculous seat pitch of not even 39 inch that's just 7 inch more than on economy. It was a bit reclinable but probably not more than 45°. I could not stretch my legs and it was impossible to sleep. There were only few newspapers and 2 low-quality gossip magazines. What was not a good alternative to the 6 movies offered in the media player distributed at the beginning of the flight. The only highlight was the food and the drinks offered they were very good. And again the crew were friendly and nice although a bit slow - the first course was served 90 minutes after take-off. But on my opinion not only the passengers but also the crew deserves a better product than this so called ""relax"" class probably they feel very embarrassed to work in such an ambiance. Swiss should be ashamed to sell something like this as Business Class.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Edelweiss Air customer review,5,2009-02-04,ATH-ZRH in economy class. Surprised to fly on a Swiss flight operated by Edelweiss but more surprised and charmed by the excellent quality of service friendly crew. The hot food was exceptional.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Edelweiss Air customer review,5,2009-01-13,Phuket to Zurich A330-300. The outbound flight on time and aircraft clean and confortable. Good breakfast and hot lunch with perfect service. The cabin crew were friendly and very efficient. Nice snack before landing in Zurich ice cream during movie and countless passes with the drink trolley. Very good airline.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Edelweiss Air customer review,,2006-02-18,EDW ZRH-CLB-MLE on the 6th feb. and MLE-ZRH on the 14th feb both in Y class. Outbound night flight with hot diner and breakfast. Perfect service friendly staff clean and confortable A330. One negative point on the night flight is that they wake up passengers 2h30 before landing in CLB very annoying. Then one hour stopover in CLB remaining on board. And 1h15 flight to MLE serving sandwiches. Return flight hot lunch Mövenpick ice cream during movie sandwiches before landing and countless passes with the drink trolley. All in all perfect airline with a great level of service and food quality. This charter airline is way better than many legacy carriers around Europe.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,

Edelweiss Air customer review,,2004-05-30,We flew Edelweissair to Cancun (Mexico) in in their Business Class. Business class was 1000 Dollar cheaper then on American Airlines or Iberia. Very personal and friendly service. Excellent menu they even served fresh Ice Cream in cones! Nice snack before landing in Orlando (stopover). The only negative point was this stop in the United States. Security checks were very annoying.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,

Edelweiss Air customer review,,2003-09-10,I flew Edelweiss to Antalya a couple of days ago and back on its only A-330. The service was excellent and cabin crew very friendly. More movies would have been great. The plane was flown by CEO Kistler on the leg to Antalya. Unfortunately check-in at Antalya took relatively long since only 3 counters were open for an A-330-flight.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,

Edelweiss Air customer review,,2003-08-28,I have been flying Edelweiss Air twice since last year from Zurich airport and I have never had any problems of any kind. The staff were friendly and efficient the flights were on time and the aircraft (A320) were clean and modern. Two weeks ago I flew ZRH-JMK (Mykonos) in Comfort Class. You just have to pay an additional fee of CHF 100.- one way and you can sit at rows 1 to 3 - the service is better and you don't have to pay for alcoholic beverages. To my opinion Edelweiss Air is an excellent airline considering the fact that it is a charter airline.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
