"""there is no in-flight entertainment""",2,2022-09-01,"At first I booked a ticket to a Vietnam Airlines flight 2 days before but I could not board the flight because I just had a surgery and the minimum time since the surgery was done did not meet the requirement for boarding a flight. Therefore, I changed the ticket to this flight. Pacific Airlines flight PIC6230, from Ho Chi Minh City to Qui Nhon. Boarded on September 1, 2022. Delayed for 20 minutes due to ""late arrival"". Perhaps it's common for Pacific Airlines because another flight on that day was also delayed for the same reason. Taxi time before takeoff: 22 minutes. The aircraft still arrived on time even if the delayed time and long taxi time was dismissed. In-flight entertainment: It was a disappointment because there is no in-flight entertainment at all. No magazine, only a menu for food and beverage. Food and beverage: There are still some choices for food and beverage as mentioned in the menu even on a short flight, although I have to pay cash to buy it. Seat comfort decent. I can change the angle of the chair so that I can relax and try not to hurt my shoulder because of the surgery. The landing at Phu Cat International Airport was hard, which was quite unexpectedly shocking. Overall, this was an unexpected flight because I couldn't board the Vietnam Airlines one 2 days prior, so I really cannot say whether I would recommend this airlines or not.",True,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh City to Qui Nhon,September 2022,4,3,,1,1,,False,
"""This company has to learn a lot about communication""",4,2022-07-25,"Not Verified |  Book through Vietnam Airlines. A few days before departure Pacific changed the original schedule of departure. At departure we had a delay (time of arrival) of 3 hrs and 59 minutes. Since this is within 4 hrs they can't do anything as a token for inconvenience or so. They say they provided drinks at the gate. We did not see them providing it, until the moment we were boarding. The whole 4 hours no information was given (except ""delayed"" on the screens. No one appeared at the desk until 5 min before boarding. This company has to learn a lot about communication and about moral behaviour (sticking to the rules is more important than keeping your customers satisfied). Flight itself was okay with friendly staff.",False,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh City to Da Nang,May 2022,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,3,,False,1
"""a terrible experience""",1,2022-07-18,"First time flying with Pacific Airlines (I booked through Vietnam Airlines). They damaged my luggage. The wheel was broken and they offered only 300k dong in compensation, which is about US $10. Pretty low knowing I have to buy a new suitcase. They even brought back the wheel that was broken and gave it to me saying I could easily fix it. Was a terrible experience and I will not fly with them again.",True,A320,Business,Economy Class,Hanoi to Da Nang,July 2022,2,2,,2,1,,False,
"""Worst airline in Vietnam""",1,2022-02-18,"Worst airline in Vietnam. They delayed the flight without any notice for 2.5 hours, which one can find only in the airport after check-in. More of that, they knew that didn't will be delayed, because they delayed all their flight that day, but still didn't notify passengers. No water, no food, nothing to apologize. Moreover, they started boarding when it should be the departure time.",True,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh to Phu Quoc,February 2022,3,3,,1,1,,False,
"""ticket didn’t have the luggage tag""",2,2021-04-02,"When I checked in, I had my checked bag but the staff at the counter didn’t put the name tag on my ticket. I was busy to fill in the medical declaration form at that time, so I didn’t notice my ticket didn’t have the luggage tag on until I got into airplane. I informed a flight attendant that my ticket didn’t have the tag and she told me that I would receive the assistance when I landed. Once I landed, I got all my luggage. I follow the exit and one of their staff stopped me and asked me the tag. I told them that I didn’t get the tag on my ticket since I checked in. Instead of telling me to wait and double checked, he kept saying that I must lose my tag somewhere and I should have checked my bag. Even I kept explaining to him what happened, he ignored me and refused to let me out of the airport. I asked him what documents did he need me to present to proof that the bag I was carrying belonged to me.  When I’m starting getting annoyed and telling him off by his attitude, his colleague came to support him and behave like I was making it become a big deal. You are being rude to your customers and ask your customers to understand your rude language?",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Phu Quoc to Ho Chi Minh City,April 2021,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,False,1
