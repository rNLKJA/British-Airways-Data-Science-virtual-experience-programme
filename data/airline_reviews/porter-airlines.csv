"""crew was not helpful at all""",2,2022-11-15,"The flight was delayed twice but that's not the irritating part. They said my carry-on was too big. I've taken 3 flights in the past week with it and it was fine. The attendant said try it, if it doesn't fit, you'll have to check it. It fit just fine under the seat in front of me! The problem was my husband sitting next to me had the same carryon and we couldn't fit both of them under the seats (the overhead was indeed too small). Since the flight was only half full, I'm not kidding maybe less than half, we asked if he could sit in an empty row and put his bag under those seats. They said no. He was not allowed putting his bag under any seat except his assigned seating. Is that really a rule? I've never encountered that before. So we had to check one of our carry-ons and had trouble at baggage claim because it wasn't there. They never told us it wasn't going with the regular baggage. So more delays, and just really aggravating because we go to the trouble of bringing thimble sized toothpaste and moisturizer, and take it all out yo display for TSA just so we can skip baggage only to be forced to do it needlessly.

Porter Airlines customer review,2,2018-07-13,"Boston to Toronto. We recently flew with this airline for a short commuter flight (approx. 1 hr 40 mins). Our flight was delayed 40 minutes, but with little explanation as to the delay. Our pilots did endeavour to make up time in the air. The design of the plane is such that, depending on the seat, passengers may experience louder in cabin noise (than had been my experience with other airlines). In-service was fairly standard, but did include free alcoholic beverages - I believe there was one white and red wine selection, respectively, and one brand of beer. On arrival, we were met with damaged luggage - one hardshell suitcase had been cracked and punctured, and one softshell suitcase arrived scraped, dirty, and weathered. We submitted a claim for the hardshell suitcase and were directed to also follow-up by phone. As the damage was extensive, we declined the airline's offer to attempt to fix the suitcase, but decided to accept the reimbursement for the bag (a standard amount) that would have at least partially paid for the replacement of the bag. After leaving the counter, we awaited the free shuttle advertised as a perk of flying with this airline. However, after waiting 15 - 20 mins, we learned that the shuttle was not running that evening and that we would need to find another mode of transport into the city. When we did arrive home, we did follow-up with the airline but were only able to leave a voicemail, re: compensation for our baggage. After not receiving a return call within 2 weeks, we found another phone number for the airline and connected directly with a kind agent who apologized for our baggage difficulties and for the missed contact. She also informed us that, unfortunately, unlike what had been described at the baggage counter, this airline's policy would not allow issue of a voucher to cover the replacement of the exact style of bag that was damaged (part of a set), but only offered a replacement bag that the airline deemed as equivalent, or a travel voucher with the airline. We did learn that, because the planes are smaller, bags are stacked (more so than, I imagine, with a larger carrier) and potentially resulting in the damages we experienced and reported. We are now paying out of pocket to replace our luggage. After this first experience with the airline and for what was to be a relatively short flight, I cannot recommend this airline. Even if this was a unique experience, the response of the airline still leaves us without recourse and paying more out of pocket to replace our bag than was the cost of our flight.

"""regularly significantly delayed""",7,2018-06-08,"Not Verified |  Toronto to Boston. Frequent flyer with this airline here. When it's good it's fantastic, when it's bad it's a disaster. The Good: The higher tiers of VIP status are very useful. Free front seats, free luggage, free flight changes, priority re-accommodation, line bypass at security (although this has not been consistent lately). Free change to earlier flights on certain routes. The city center airport is great for anyone living downtown or traveling to business meetings downtown. The wait at customs is never long. Security usually not bad. Luggage to carousel time at city center airport is crazy fast. Free snacks in the lounge and free drinks/snacks/alcohol in flight. Flight attendants are usually pretty nice. Even before I had VIP status, they would occasionally accommodate a change or request where any other airline definitely would not have. The noise doesn't bother me as I am used to it at this point, but if you are used to jet planes then you will find these planes noisy. The BAD: Flights are fairly regularly significantly delayed, mostly during the winter months. Flights get cancelled more often than other airlines as the planes are tiny, so is the airport/runway, and the weather by the water is not always cooperative (fog!). 2. Communication to customers regarding delays is almost non-existent. You can track your incoming plane on a variety of apps and know the outgoing flight will be delayed by a ton, but Porter rarely reports the delay until 15-30 minutes before the original scheduled departure - at which point most people are already in the lounge waiting.  City center airport's US departures and arrivals side is mixed with the Thunder Bay/Sudbury routes for some strange reason. The result is long waits at the gate once the plane arrives, just sitting around doing nothing and stuck on the plane because a Canadian flight is offloading/boarding and the US arrivals can't mix with the domestic. I have waited up to an hour to get off the plane in the past because of this problem. One of the absolute most frustrating thing about Porter. 4. Unpredictable line bypass - this has been worst in the last 6 months. Those of us with VIP rely on our security line bypass, often arriving 30 mins before a flight with carry on only.

You can imagine the mood of about 75 passengers lining up to be handled and rerouted by only 3 people of Porter. Just do the calculation: let’s say 50 units of people times 10 minutes each divided by 3, that is a long waiting time when you are upset and tired. My turn finally came at around midnight. Airline staff were evidentially overwhelmed by the situation and not at all cooperative. First, they only wanted to reimburse the lost flight or book you on another flight two days later. These were the only two alternatives, nobody talked about taking charge of food, lodging or other expenses, which occur during such a situation. Fortunately, I had the luck to talk with our corporate travel agent during my waiting time, who consulted me not to accept any reimbursement and push for other alternatives. Furthermore, she informed me that Porter Airlines had empty seats on Saturday. Confronted with this statement of open seats the next day, my counterpart from Porter simply stated that they were for paying customers and not available to us. Also, they were unwilling to put me on another airline. So, I eventually accepted a flight on July 2, i.e. 2 days later, and they actually had to offer me to take charge of the hotel, which I had to look for myself. But, I was advised that all other expenses are on my account. Let’s make a long story short. Instead of getting to Montreal in some hours, I will hopefully arrive within 2 days. This all is quite upsetting, but what upsets me most is the uncooperative attitude of Porter’s staff. Personnel did not show any empathy or concern for their passengers in this situation, even worse, they did not even try to support or accommodate its passengers during this mishap. =",False,Q400,Business,Economy Class,Boston to Montreal via Toronto,July 2017,3,4,,3,4,,False,

That doesn't work for people trying to schedule meetings and events.

I'm not sure what shoving the suit bag into my carry on accomplished nor how it resolved the ""safety"" issue. The agent clearly had no common sense and went on to scold me to ""stop rolling my eyes"" when I couldn't fathom how putting my suit bag into my carry on fixed her ""safety issue"". I know people complain about Air Canada but I have never encountered this level of nitpicking in a weak attempt to try to get me to check in my luggage since I had ""three pieces"" or lack of common sense from staff.

I don't like flying so I tend to avoid flights with connections. Porter Airlines would not be my first choice, since most of their routes require a connection, but I have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of service and efficiency at Porter. I have flown Porter twice now and must say this airline really makes an effort to make flying a pleasant rather than an experience to get past with fingers crossed. The flights left on time, the business center, free quality snacks and beverages really helped to make the travel experience enjoyable.

Porter Airlines customer review,,2015-03-25,I have usually been a big supporter of Porter but the last 24 hours have challenged my loyalty to the airline. My flight from Newark was cancelled bad weather happens nothing you can do about it. However the response to the situation is what infuriated me. After not making the stand-by list for the last flight out I asked for assistance in booking a hotel as I imagined they would have dealt with this situation previously. Not only were the staff unhelpful they were downright rude. Given the situation and not wanting to hunt down hotel rooms to sleep for only 6 hours I decided to bunk it in the Newark airport. In the morning while getting my ticket for the morning plane the service desk tried to charge me for another $26 bag fee even though I pre-paid from Toronto. After determining that I indeed had pre-paid the fee she put the bag through. After finally arriving to Toronto at 9.30am we were treated to a 45 minute delay with the baggage carousel. For 30 minutes my fellow passengers and I looked at each other dumbfounded as our luggage was at the top of the conveyor belt. Again these things happen but you would think an announcement of the maintenance issue would be a good idea by Porter. Eventually a woman with a walkie talkie was working with the maintenance team to get things going. While it would have been nice of her to provide an update to the customers about what was going on I am not going to moan after a certain point realizing the issue was going to take awhile she took off her high heels climbed the carousel and started to pass the luggage that had made it to the top of the conveyor belt.

Porter Airlines customer review,,2015-02-18,Terrible I arrived at Toronto Island (Billy Bishop) at 7am after looking online to find the flight to Halifax delayed hoping to move it to the flight just after. Everything went fine then when boarding time came and went the excesses from Porter started first they had told us someone vomited on a seat on the planes approach and needed cleaning (the plane had been on the ground all night and should been cleaned) then they informed us the plane needed to be de-iced then they inform us that there is no first officer for the flight because he was at another airport. Lying to us the entire time I have no idea how people travel with Porter for business they are never on time and their staff is hit and miss by what I saw today also under staffed.

Porter Airlines customer review,9,2015-02-12,Flew from Toronto to Newark over the Christmas Holidays. Booked the flight less than 2 weeks out for the cheapest price available at the time.

I love the lounge at Billy Bishop Airport (Toronto) where you get complimentary (unlimited) cookies Starbucks coffee Tazo Tea water pop almonds newspapers and Wi-Fi.

Porter Airlines customer review,3,2015-01-11,I have flown with Porter a couple of times and haven't had issues but after today I will definitely be looking into other options. I arrived at the Toronto island airport at 11.00 am today for a 12.35 pm flight to Chicago. The flight was already delayed about 20 minutes by the time I got to the lounge. At around 12.30 pm Porter staff started asking for volunteers to fly at a later time as weather conditions required a lighter load on the plane. People volunteered and the rest of us finally started boarding just after 1.00 pm. When I finally got on the plane the pilot announced that we would be waiting for passengers from a connecting flight. Then around 2.00 pm the flight attendant announced that a few people would have to leave the plane and book a later flight because the reduced visibility required an even lighter load. I was one of the people selected to leave the plane which was incredibly frustrating because I did not have any checked luggage (come on how much weight could I have possibly added to the plane) and booked my flight more than two months ago. The next flight available was two days later. I did get a voucher which I appreciate but what happened today was just unacceptable - probably the worst experience I've ever had with an airline. It has been common knowledge for days that a snow storm was approaching so I don't understand why Porter had to wait until I was buckled and seated in an aircraft before telling me I had to fly at another time. Just appalling. P.S. - It turns out that four Porter flights flying out of Toronto island airport had to be diverted this week. This airline is a disaster.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,2,,False,
Porter Airlines customer review,,2014-12-22,Flight 0383 on Monday Dec 8 2014 the outbound was cancelled due to 'mechanical' reasons. Of course I was only notified of the cancellation when I was in a taxi half way to the airport. I paid $1450 for my flight to Chicago due to booking only 5 days in advance. In addition Porter charged me $26 each way for the one bag I checked. On the return flight 0392 on Dec 10 2014 my bag was 1 kilo (2.2 lbs) over the limit. I was told I could remove weight or pay an additional $75 excess bag fee. At the same time the passenger at check in next to me was advised that he should carry on the bag he was going to check because it was below the carry on weight. I removed some items from my bag and went back to check in. The check-in agent advised me that my bag was now 1 kilo under and would I like to put anything back in my bag. What a joke. Absolutely no common sense with respect to the check-in agent. The flight was half empty so weight and balance was not an issue. Flight left about 10 minutes late and after 20 minutes in the air the captain came on the PA system to advise that a latch had come loose on the cargo door and we would be required to return to Chicago. Another 'mechanical' issue I suppose. Flight eventually left one hour later so that we arrived about 2 hours late. So Porter wasted 4 hours of my valuable time yet wanted to charge me $75 for having 1 kilo excess baggage. I think the service was really unacceptable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,1,,False,
Porter Airlines customer review,4,2014-11-17,Newark to Sudbury via Toronto. I really wish I could give Porter Airlines a better rating. They have nice planes great staff the lounges are wonderful but their reliability makes me hesitant to use them again. More's the pity because it could be the best airline in North America. The flight from Newark to Toronto was on time and the service was faultless. On arrival in Toronto all looked okay for the next leg to Sudbury but then that flight was cancelled because of maintenance issues. I was shifted to a later flight scheduled to depart four hours later but was delayed by a further two hours. Many other flights were also delayed. Credit goes to the cabin crew on this flight for maintaining a positive demeanour despite being faced with a very grumpy passenger load. Based on comments I heard on the aircraft and have read on here cancellations and long delays have become commonplace at Porter. I think this airline is perhaps growing too fast and its aircraft inventory is too small to cope with anything but one of those extremely rare days when nothing goes wrong. It really needs to focus more on reliability.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,False,

The outbound trip Saturday was fine the return trip on Sunday was a total disaster. Saturday's flights were nearly empty but the flights Sunday were packed so it seems that if there is a rush the airline has no idea how to handle it. There were no weather issues or anything to cause multiple delays on Sunday and I really was never given a clear answer as to why all of my flights were delayed. It was a mix of ""technical issues"" and ""delays at other airports"". I was leaving Montreal for Toronto then had a connecting flight to Chicago. When booking my tickets all I was offered was a 30 minute change over between flights for the flight home. Porter in Toronto has a small terminal so on a normal day this should be no problem. In the end I missed my connection in Toronto to Chicago because of the original delay of 45 minutes in Montreal and my new second flight (an hour and half after my original flight) was also delayed by an hour and a half.

We flew from Montreal to Toronto changed plans to fly to Boston with a connecting flight in Boston to Houston. We missed our connecting flight because of the changed schedule and then further delays. The flight leaving Montreal was approximately 1.5 hours late. Then our connection in Toronto was late as well. We originally were to arrive in Boston at 4.35pm but did not arrive until 5.50pm.

We fly for about an hour thinking we are going to Toronto when they tell us we have to land in Ottawa. They blame all this on the weather. Put us up in a hotel 30 minutes from the airport. Porter fails miserably when it comes to having a back-up plan and communicating with their passengers.

After further delays she eventually left Thunder Bay on Porter flight 638 at 21.29 and was diverted to Hamilton during the last stages of landing just minutes before 23.00. The diversion is due to a curfew on landing and taking off from Toronto's Billy Bishop Airport. Our issue is that Porter Airline did not communicate to passengers that the flight would be diverted. Porter did not inform those waiting to pick up passengers at Billy Bishop Airport. Airport was closed at 23.00 and no staff were present. The family member sent to Billy Bishop Airport was left searching for our daughter.

Sometime after 02.00 am a local hotel was arranged where she stayed for a few short hours before making her way to the Billy Bishop Airport for her connecting flight.

Porter Airlines customer review,,2014-01-03,Dec 26th 2013. Nice sunny day. Posted a 35 minute delay for our flight to Washington USA. After an hour we ask them if we will make our connecting flight to Iceland then on to Manchester they say yes. After almost 90 minutes delay we phone the main line they say we will leave shortly and make our connecting flight. Pilot says he will try and make up some time he doesn't and as we land we still have to pick up our bags and re-clear USA customs. People let us ahead of them in line and we by pass picking up our bags and the Iceland flight had already left! Nobody around at Porter counter.

Porter Airlines customer review,1,2014-01-02,Dec 25th YTZ to YHZ. Return was Dec 31st YHZ to YTZ. Porter seems to be one of those airlines that people either love or hate. On the love side of the equation passengers get complimentary alcoholic beverages and box lunches that are tasty. Drinks are served in glass not plastic. On the hate side of the equation the airline can't seem to get organized when bad weather happens or when the plane fills up with too many leisure passengers all of whom tote 20 kg suitcases. Citing weight restrictions they remove those cases but tell nobody until they arrive at the destination. In today's environment it is tough to be a price leader as well as deliver excellent customer service at the same time. If they don't get the right balance soon they'll have more passengers leaving with bad impressions than favourable ones.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,,5,,False,
Porter Airlines customer review,1,2013-12-30,23 Dec 2013 Toronto (YTZ) - Ottawa (YOW). Porter Airlines is one of the few airlines you can count on to be delayed every single time you fly them. It is completely unacceptable that they constantly make their customers late and offer nothing to make up for any such inconvenience. Even just while sitting in the lounge for several hours waiting for my flight as other airlines had no issues getting their flights off the ground on time Porter cancelled two flights and suggested that those customers fly with another airline (and pay the exorbitant fees they were charging at the gate) just to get home on time for Christmas. In fact I was just notified that my return leg of the flight I am reviewing has also just been delayed. Flyer beware.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,False,
Porter Airlines customer review,,2013-12-25,Absolutely horrible experience over the last three days trying to get our family friend back to New York. Sunday with almost no communication to passengers he sat waiting for 10 hours at Billy Bishop until flight was cancelled. Monday same thing - full day at airport scheduled flight cancelled. Today - they are on their third (3rd) plane and still haven't found one adequate to make the one hour trip to New York. I could have driven him back and forth to New York three times in the time we have been sitting here. inexcusable terrible service and we do not plan on ever using Porter again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,,,1,,False,
Porter Airlines customer review,2,2013-12-17,"I have been flying Porter for years and appreciate the friendly service nicely turned out cabin crew and the ""more human"" approach to air travel. Unfortunately we flew from Ottawa to Halifax yesterday in the midst of a storm. Our flight did manage to depart (late) although earlier flights had been cancelled. We arrived in YHZ and waited for our bags. Now sometimes baggage delivery is slow in Halifax so I was not worried initially. During this time another flight was called to queue up at the baggage desk (two service staff) hundreds of people but no announcements were made relative to our flight. After an hour I interrupted one of the agents and asked about the Ottawa baggage. She said it wasn't coming - yet there had been no announcement or no instructions. Upon arriving home I sent an email and called the call centre. The call centre was just rebooking passengers and gave me a number to call in the morning for baggage. It's been nearly 18 hours with no response from Porter. This is not acceptable. I really expected more from this company with it's focus on customer service. How hard would it be to email everyone on the flight or have had an agent come out and explain the situation? This is the fourth time my bags have been lost and by far this the worst experience I've had with missing luggage.",False,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,,,2,,False,
Porter Airlines customer review,1,2013-12-16,I'm blind. I was flying from Toronto to Thunder Bay on Friday December 13. At first the CSRs came around to ask if I needed something every so often but then that stopped. Two to three hours of having no access to a washroom or anything they announce that the flights were cancelled due to a snow storm. I phone the Porter call center because I was stranded in the airport. Finally they agreed to accompany me to (and pay for) a taxi back home to Brantford for the night and return me the next day. I'd hate to know how much distress they've put upon other travelers with special needs!

Flying out of Toronto is excellent the lounge is so nice free coffee water etc no long lines for security. The planes are so comfortable huge seats all like exit rows. I fly to Montreal for business once or twice a year always with Porter. If you fly at lunch you get a meal which is usually a chicken wrap with salad plus free drink like wine soda etc and this is a 55 minute flight.

The flight out of Boston was delayed for over an hour because the flight crew had not had enough time off between flights. This delay caused me to miss my connecting flight in Toronto to Halifax and they could not get me on another flight to Halifax for 2 1/2 hours later.

It gives a negative first impression.

Porter Airlines customer review,3,2013-09-13,IAD-YTZ-IAD 9/11-12 2013. Why this airline gets the ratings it does is a mystery to me. Completely ordinary aircraft cabins and seats not terribly competitive pricing a thoroughly subpar waiting/services area in its hub airport (I've seen better at US Air and United) and nothing whatsoever to distinguish itself from the crowd in any other respect other than the fact that its staff seems nicer than that of most of its counterpart US airlines. Bottom line - I would neither recommend nor not recommend this airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,3,,False,
Porter Airlines customer review,1,2013-09-13,Attempting to fly out of Newark to Toronto we were told that we were held due to fog at Billy Bishop airport in Toronto. Odd thing was that was exactly what the people at Billy Bishop airport were being told were the ground stop conditions prevailing at Newark. So clearly neither condition was true. Delayed 5.5 hours in the airport with promises that the ground stop could be lifted soon and that we might be able to board shortly. We ultimately did and then spent 3 hours 40 minutes trapped on the plane on the runway. Told that the flight was cancelled. When we finally deplaned we were greeted by a line of approximately 200 passengers who had also had their flights cancelled with all of 2 customer service representatives handling the situation with a public address system that had stopped working relying instead on word of mouth trickling down through the line. There was no effort to either consolidate the lines or open another line to handle the 100+ passengers who had just deplaned leaving it to people in the competing lines to fight it out between themselves. I had to intervene to prevent a screaming match from turning to blows. There were people on my flight who had been trying to get a flight out of Newark via Porter for two solid days and failed. Customer service was AWOL and information not given in a timely manner which would have allowed passengers to reschedule their plans hours earlier.

Also the restroom was dirty and the lounge was messy and fridges were empty coffee machine (one don't work and the other has no beans and no milk). When someone ask to have it look after the csr at the desk just ignored him.

Porter Airlines customer review,10,2013-08-20,Newark to Toronto r/t - Porter Airlines should rename its cabin to Comfort Class as economy does not describe the experience. For a North American carrier to provide a meal for an hour flight is noteworthy but for it to be free is nostalgic. I am a vegetarian and on returning the chicken wrap to the cabin crew they gave me an extra salad and came round with a couple of mini chocolate bars and extra nuts - most thoughtful and then apologized with a smile. On time convenient and Canadian hospitality - plus complimentary access to a lounge with hot/cold beverages delicious short bread cookies and WIFI. Billy Bishop City airport can put you in the heart of Toronto's financial district in under 30 mins from landing.

Porter Airlines customer review,2,2013-07-17,Toronto - Boston return June 28 — July 1 2013. PD 941 — PD 946. A lot of folks are impressed with the time savings of flying an airline from the Island. Here's my experience when arriving from the US. We arrived a half hour late due to weather — not Porter's fault. However Billy Bishop Airport should have been named Mickey Mouse airport. When the plane arrived at the gate people anxiously got up to leave. After a few minutes the plane's door opened and people started getting off. Then those people were sent back into the plane. It turns out that a domestic flight was loading and it's against rules for international arriving passengers and domestic passengers to mingle in the same zone. Why there is only one zone I don't know. People on our plane had to wait until the other plane was loaded. Then at Canadian Customs and Immigration there are two officers for passengers and one other who looks after airline staff first before helping with regular folks. Since another US flight had got in just ahead of us it took about 40 minutes to get through. However I was surprised to see people who had been much closer to the front of the Customs line still on the Island waiting in another line for the ferry to take us back to the mainland. I find that Porter uses its seat sale promotions as a classic bait and switch. I was enticed by the low fares advertised but could not find those fares on any flight that was convenient. In the meantime I'll pay the extra limo fare to go to Pearson and fly Air Canada which everyone loves to hate but which over many decades has proved to be extraordinarily reliable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,2,,,,,False,

Upon arriving I was told that their Service Provider was down and the flight would be delayed a half hour to an hour. 3 hours later we boarded. As a result I arrived late and missed an important event. Porter did apologize and further claimed it was not their fault. As if that is supposed to erase the draining experience of sitting in an airport terminal for 3 hours longer than necessary.

Nothing was mentioned about a delay while checking in. About 10 minutes before boarding a Porter representative arrived to explain that the plane leaving Toronto experienced mechanical problems and returned back. The next flight after ours apparently was cancelled as a result. Reading the reviews it is clear that Porter Airlines is not very reliable. Hopefully it improves before it thinks seriously about expanding. Not convinced at this time I will use this airline again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,False,

Boarded on time and let us sit on the plane for 3 hours knowing full well the plane could not take off due to weather. Then as per FAA regulations they de-boarded us and made us sit in the refrigerator they call Newark Airport for another 8 hours. Given 3 choices: 1. Cancel your reservation and forfeit any refund you may get. The money would be given as a ""credit"" to use on another Porter flight. 2. Take your luggage and leave. You could then call Porter and see if the flight was rescheduled. Of course if you miss the flight you don't get a refund or credit. 3. Wait for endless hours and hope the flight takes off at some point. Of course if the flight is cancelled you would likely be stuck in Jersey for a couple days until it could be rescheduled (due to Memorial Day). Continually lied to by Porter CSRs and were only told the truth by the flight crew. No more slots to fit the flight in until Saturday and they hoped to fly it out after the airport officially closed and land at Pearson instead of Billy Bishop. This is ultimately what happened. Of course it was almost 1 am when we cleared customs.

One ticket confirmation - two people with same last name. Guess what? We want to sit together - what a concept. Go online 2 minutes after the 24 hour advance online check-in option opens. Only one seat indicated to be available. Call customer service. Initially they have us sitting several rows apart but finally get 2 aisle seats same row. Refuse to allow us window and aisle seat same row without payment for seat selection. We never pay for seat selection on any airline - and we fly worldwide - not starting now. Told the flight is full. Go online and pretend to book five tickets same flight pay for seat selection - get desired seating. Do this while on phone with customer service and they still refuse to change our seats. This is a simple request and a common one. Accommodate your customers. Better yet make your online ticketing and check in system work so it recognizes that people who book together should be seated together. This is not rocket science. If they can't get this basic concept they don't get the airline biz. Never flying Porter again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,1,,,1,,False,
Porter Airlines customer review,,2013-05-08,I haven't flown yet on Porter but their booking and scheduling deserves a negative review. I booked in January for a trip in May and they cancelled a flight rebooked me for 2 hours later and now today I check my booking (no email was sent to me) and they have cancelled my flight again and have me travelling a full 5.5 hours earlier than I booked! I am a very frequent traveller and thought that over the years I have encountered every type of delay and issue but this one just floors me. We are travelling for a sporting event that Porter has associated with and offered a promo code and now they have us leaving before the event is even over! I am nervous now that my flight won't even be scheduled correctly for the departure. I can understand weather mechanical delays etc but scheduling this wacky is poor customer service. I am now faced with an extra night in a hotel and a complete upset in my schedule. When I speak to the customer service they are not apologetic. I can't see flying with Porter in the future due to lack of reliability in scheduling. They just lost a customer before I stepped onto the plane.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,2,,,,,False,

Porter Airlines customer review,7,2012-10-24,I have mixed feelings about Porter. I have found flights between Ottawa and Toronto are getting cancelled more and more often. Sure they'll bump you to an earlier flight if there is room but they are also quick to cancel your flight and leave you stranded for another hour or four in the airport. It's not bad in Ottawa as you can walk around (just a huge inconvenience) but in Toronto it means you're stuck at a tiny airport with nothing to do! The lounges are nice and it's great to get wifi service but if these flight cancellations become any more frequent I'm going back to the other airlines which is why I'm giving this air service a lower score (otherwise I'd probably put it at a nine).

The direct flight from Pearson is two hours however I live 10 minutes from the island airport and over an hour from Pearson so for me the time was neutral and avoiding the crowds annoyance and expense of getting to Pearson was a big plus. Check-in security and the waiting area at the island airport makes you feel like a person travelling again. The turbo prop planes they use have no vibrations (unlike other prop planes I have flown on) and it really feels just like a jet.

On the morning of our flight back to Dulles I received an email that our 11am flight had been cancelled and we were rescheduled on the 6pm flight. I called customer service to get booked on the 1pm flight and of course that flight was fully booked. Porter had only re-booked one seat on the 6pm flight not two. I spoke with the customer agent and the best they could do was put us one in front of the other and recommended I ask again at the airport. As we were 2 hours from the airport I had to reschedule our transportation to the airport. At the airport the check in rep did manage to change our seats together.

Porter Airlines customer review,10,2012-07-19,First time flying Porter Chicago Midway to Quebec City via Toronto round trip. Bottom line: excellent. Arrived in Toronto and was a bit confused on how to transfer to the connection. Coming into Canada from USA one retrieves checked bag (even though checked through) and goes through Canadian customs. Once through customers one takes it upstairs to connecting flight bag transfer where it is scanned and sent on its way to the connecting flight. On the return to the USA this step is not necessary since USA passport control and customs is done at the USA destination airport in my case Midway in Chicago - which was very fast. I echo the comments of others pleased with on board services. The only thing that would make Porter even better from my point of view would be to add on board wi-fi. One additional suggestion I would add is to always check in at the Porter service desk once you get in your lounge (they have a USA bound lounge and a domestic Canadian destination lounge). For web check in travelers which I was one there is an added security step that they need to do. I had thought this was done in Quebec city but apparently they had missed that. In any case my first trip with Porter certainly won't be my last.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,

Tried to go to web check in but only one of two of our reserved seats showed up and there were no two available seats next to each other and web check in would not let us proceed to next screen. Had to call Porter and was told two seats beside each other weren't available and to speak to FA when boarding. Refunded both seat reservation fees but not willing to compensate in any other way.

Porter Airlines customer review,5,2012-03-30,Return trip from Newark to Toronto. This was our fourth flight in as many weeks on Porter and we are both VIP Porter members. Booked on the 6.15 but our business in NYC finished earlier than expected we arrived at Newark to get on the earlier 4pm flight. We were then told we had to wait over 3 hours as we had booked firm fare. We sat for 3 hours and watched the half empty 4pm leave before boarding our nearly full 6.15.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,9,2012-02-15,All employees gave an excellent service. Very comfortable hassle free departure lounge with free snacks and Internet access. This level of service transferred to the flight also Toronto to Boston with a personable crew comfortable leather seats and again a free tasty lunch and wine in real glasses. I just wish that we had a comparable airline here in the UK.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,9,2012-02-01,Toronto to Boston return. A problem with booking was solved extremely quickly via email. Their lounge in Toronto was excellent for an economy-class ticket (free wifi snacks and coffee). As an added plus there was a free seat next to me on both legs. Above all that cheaper than Air Canada and American Airlines.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,9,2012-01-06,Return-trip to Toronto from Sudbury and although delayed for 1.5 hours in Sudbury staff were informative courteous on the ground and in the air they offered as much as we could eat and drink. Return trip was flawless on-time great service and always with a smile at an affordable price.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,,2012-01-05,Had my whole family aboard on a new flight route from Toronto to Burlington Vermont return. On arrival in Burlington (a flight that takes just over a hour) they kept everyone waiting to go through customs at a separate building then bussed passengers to baggage claim. It took over an hour for the baggage to arrive. On the return flight to Toronto the flight took off a hour late with no milk onboard for 2 toddlers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Porter Airlines customer review,10,2011-10-13,Best experience ever! I was very impressed with Porter. From the private lounge with computers to use free snack area to flight crew - who doesn't love free booze? Great lunch sandwich and cookies!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,9,2011-09-21,London to New York then NYC to Toronto. The outbound flight was delayed due to fog but they were lovely about it and let us off the plane. They explained several times and didn't leave us hanging. Staff were accommodating. My luggage was over the limit as I had flown premium from London to NYC and that allows me two cases. They were understanding. On my return I was worried as my luggage was even heavier but I explained that I was going back to London and they were lovely. Free coffee and shortbread was a nice extra. The flight was on time and I would use them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,9,2011-09-15,This was my first experience flying Porter and it won't be my last. From the moment I got to the Ottawa airport to check-in I was pleased. The agent at the counter was friendly and helpful. She proceeded to inform me of my departure gate and where the Porter lounge was and to help myself to anything I wanted. Onboard the attendants were helpful and attentive once in the air we were served a box lunch wasn't expecting this at all (considering it's only a 45 mins flight from Ottawa to Toronto) and a beverage of your choice. Arrived at Billy Bishop airport in time for my connecting flight to Windsor.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,8,2011-09-01,Windsor to Ottawa. Windsor airport lacks services in general. The Porter staff were friendly and check-in easy. The lounges in Ottawa and Toronto were quite comfortable and it was a plus to have the free Internet access. The snacks are certainly an upgrade from anything offered on other carriers and the flight costs were far more affordable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,10,2011-08-30,YQM-YOW-YTZ. Check-in was easy at YQM with polite staff. Bright airy cabin clean-smelling inside the cabin comfortable leather seats with generous space between each row. Professional flight attendants because of a quick turn around at Ottawa before continuing to Toronto we were served food and drinks twice. Both times we were given a box containing a sandwich a salad and a piece of chocolate candy plus the drinks service. Even though it's not warm food its tasty better than pretzels and appreciated on a short flight. The flight was smooth and we landed in Toronto 20 mins ahead of schedule.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,10,2011-08-05,Round Trip from Chicago to Toronto and back to Chicago. They have a very nice lounge in Toronto which I got to experience when flying back to Chicago. Free use of the computer internet free snacks juice etc. The airlines really tries to take care of you in terms of making you comfortable. My flight was only 1 hr 30 mins and they gave out snacks. Great value for money with nice extras provided.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,10,2011-07-06,Porter from Chicago Midway-Toronto. Excellent trip best flight we've had in years. Staff was good plane with just two seats each side and lots of leg room for normal size people. Lounge in Toronto very nice with free beverages snacks and WI-FI.. There is a free shuttle to the Fairmount Royal York Hotel which is a central location.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,3,2011-07-03,A 40 min flight from Windsor-Toronto took 6.5 hrs. What a disappointment. Spending so much money on advertising and not ensuring customer satisfaction is a waste of your resources. Toronto is very sophisticated and smoothly operated. Some compensation should be offered more than a $12 luncheon voucher. I am very disappointed. Next time I will be driving to Windsor not flying Porter.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Porter Airlines customer review,,2011-06-30,"Toronto-Chicago. Incoming aircraft was delayed due to weather from departure city. Aircraft was boarded at 8:10pm. Flight is further delayed. Reason scheduled flight crew cannot exceed 14 consecutive hrs of flight time. Aircraft is de-boarded and passengers must wait for a new aircraft and flight crew. No updates. At 10:10pm was offered a small box of refreshments. Contents: 1 cold muffin and a yoghurt. At 11:00pm announcement was made. Flight is cancelled. Next flight tomorrow morning at 9:00am. No offers for a hotel or cab fare. What was stated by the ground crew ""we need to clear the building as quickly as possible because the last island ferry is at midnight"". This is the experience from a first time passenger of Porter airlines.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Porter Airlines customer review,2,2011-06-26,Montreal-Toronto. Morning flight. The night before there had been weather related issues that disrupted the positioning of crew and equipment resulting in cancelled and delayed flights in the morning. It happens and one cannot blame an airline for that. However the ground communication was not good. Porter has a problem in providing updates at the best of times. Although I received an email I was already at the airport when it arrived. I noted that the flight crew was at the gate and one of the additional delays was due to there not being a flight plan issued for the already delayed flight. I am usually a big fan of Porter's inflight service but the service on this flight was poor. All I wanted was a glass of water. The FAs forgot our row and the one behind us. Minor issue but when added to the flight delay and poor management of the situation it put me into a grumpy mood. It was my worst Porter flight experience. Porter is the preferred commuter line for business travellers and on this day it successfully encouraged a great many to consider the alternative Air Canada service into the airport. I hope Porter improves as I do like the airline but its slipping bit by bit and will see this reflected in the loss of passengers as they return to the AC shuttle flights.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,10,2011-06-09,Montreal to Toronto. Friendly crew and ground staff and super comfortable plane. I was most impressed with their lounge in Toronto with all the freebees.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,2,2011-05-26,Very poor performance and communications by Porter at Toronto. After telling us the inbound flight was in the air they kept delaying the departure time over and over. 4 hours later we were still not gone. First time on Porter and last time ever. Lounge is nice but no real food - cookies is not good when flights are delayed.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Porter Airlines customer review,10,2011-05-23,The staff and the service amazing we just flew to Halifax from St Johns Newfoundland. It was prompt and very helpful staff were fantastic offered help and anything that we need we a deaf bowling team and they treat us just like anyone else.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,10,2011-05-05,An excellent flight over the Easter weekend from Ottawa to Toronto - the lounge in both airports are great and a pleasant surprise to those used to flying Air Canada economy. Ditto for the free lunch on Easter Monday. Excellent service throughout the entire journey - I'd fly with them in a heartbeat.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,8,2011-04-03,When the destination I am going to is covered by Porter I do not hesitate to book my flight with them. Good things about Porter - lounge at YTC is amazing no waiting in line at security in contrast to YYZ-T1 on a Monday morning. They handle fragile Items in a remarkable way. Downside - not very nice staff when checking in luggage. Expensive over weight and extra luggage charges.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,10,2011-03-03,Toronto to Montreal. The check-in was simple and waiting lounge was amazing with comfy chairs free drinks and snacks as well as free internet. The plane seats were leather and wide free snack and alcoholic drinks also a plus.This was definitely a great experience and I would definitely fly Porter again!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,,2011-02-26,I used to be a huge Porter Airline fan but recently I have found that their service has gone downhill. They've canceled 3 out of my 4 last flights at the last minute (presumably because the flights were not full and they wanted to consolidate volume on a less traveled route) leaving me stranded. Their call center was rude and unhelpful when I tried to rebook - such a contrast to the service I received when calling to change reservations just a year ago! I'd recommend avoiding Porter at least until their service and reliability improve.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Porter Airlines customer review,10,2011-02-25,I just returned to YSB (sudbury) on Porter having flown them 6 times since December for personal and business travel. I can easily book a flight with a discount that they offer and get a meal and a drink. Every meal has been different and staff are very good.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,10,2011-01-21,It takes you back to the days when airlines actually cared for the customers and they were not just a seat number. The cost of the flight was perfect for our budget. We took advantage of a 30% discount that was offered during Christmas time. They gave us the opportunity to choose the seat we wanted on the flight. The aircraft was clean and for it's size comfortable. The cabin crew were courteous. It was nice getting a glass for drinks rather than a can or a paper/plastic cup. They also provided a delicious snack during the flight. There was no extra charge for a glass of wine. Check in great - they have kiosks set up so it take only moments to check in. Pleasant waiting for the flight in a very comfortable lounge area and again provided with refreshments at no extra charge.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,1,2010-11-13,I have used Porter for booking business flights for management and colleagues and in the past year we have had numerous cancellations of flights with very little or no notice. Porter should not claim to have so many flights per day to certain destinations when they cancel flights on a whim because there is not enough people on them. I would not recommend this airline for anyone using it for business travel unless they allow themselves a huge window prior to their first meeting or chances are they won't make it as their flight very likely will be cancelled and they will be bumped to later in the day.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Porter Airlines customer review,9,2010-10-26,First time flying with Porter from Halifax to St. John's and return this week. Very good service cabin crew on both flights very professional. Check in staff at both airports very good. Flight from St. John's was delayed due to weather and received e-mail notice before heading to the airport so did not have to hang around the airport.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,10,2010-08-30,Hospitality and care is outstanding. Cabin comfort seats and leg room all appreciated. Check in than pleasant and accommodating.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,9,2010-08-04,Toronto-Newark. Great first experience with Porter. A hassle free getaway from Toronto convenient island airport downtown. I appreciated that all the extras like baggage wifi snacks transfers were free - I hope they don't change. The lounge was modern and comfortable enough with frequent updates on flights delayed due to weather. The cafe area in the terminal was a nice touch but was a bit messy when I arrived and the toilet needed a bit of freshening up too. Onboard cabin was clean legroom great service friendly and professional. Tiny onboard snack served and a real glass of wine. Can't complain. Good value great service on the ground and in the air. Something that seems to be a thing of the past for most of the big US airlines.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,9,2010-07-24,NYC to Toronto and delighted by Toronto waiting lounge. The airport is extremely convenient to downtown Toronto (arriving we walked to the new Thompson hotel. Returning we took a cab for about $8.) The waiting lounge in Toronto features seating for 2-4 people with small tables reading lamps and low screens so that every seating section feels semi-private. They also offer complimentary coffee tea sodas and snacks (nuts Walker's shortbread). I found the check-in and waiting experience convenient and pleasant.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,10,2010-07-14,Toronto to Chicago Midway was outstanding. I had to reschedule last-minute and had this done with no questions asked for a pittance. The experience at Toronto airport is civilized. Check- in staff friendly and the same number of agents (check-in and waiting lounge) would probably serve like 20 times more people at a regular airport. In the lounge free wi-fi espresso teas soft drinks munchables papers power plugs and fabulous views of the city. On the plane there was some tasty food and drinks served in china and glassware. And when we arrived our bags were waiting for us taken off the belt with handles pulled out. How's that for a nice touch? Plus the immigration at Midway is a breeze. I enjoyed the lack of commercial outlets around the airport - this is down to taste but do you really want to pass through rows of greasy spoon and faux haute couture establishments on your way to the plane? The only legitimate concern remains their apparent willingness to cancel flights.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,8,2010-07-06,EWR-YTZ return. Have not experienced flight cancellation/consolidation with Porter in three trips thus far in spite of having two flights being nearly empty! YTZ is immensely convenient and in spite of some lower fares to YYZ they rarely make up for the increased stress taxi fare and time that comes with flying into Pearson. Porter is much more stress- free. Good cabin and service for short-haul excellent ground staff in YTZ - nearly missed my flight and they managed to get me from the ferry to the gate in 5 minutes flat (do not recommend trying this intentionally however)! Good service and value but VIPorter frequent flier program needs work - coordination with booking system and check-in is poor (name on VIPorter didn't match passport name necessitating a few annoying calls). Also wish you could select a seat in advance.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,10,2010-06-30,Very friendly staff in the airports and the plane. Planes clean and comfortable - only two seats per side. Web site good. Free snacks/sandwich and drinks for economy. Planes are turbo prop but modern and appear well maintained and running three flights a day from St. John's to Halifax.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,1,2010-05-31,I will not fly Porter again for business. They cancel and consolidate flights all the time - I've been the victim of this 2 of the last 3 flights I've taken with them. I almost got stranded in Boston overnight as they cancelled the last flight of the day on me. This past weekend they cancelled my flight again. I think this is because of low passenger loads. But they should not be able to claim say 10 flights per day to a destination if they cancel half of them. A free coffee in the Toronto departures lounge (no free coffee on your way back as there are no lounges in other airports for Porter) does not make up for my lost time and the stress of not knowing if I'll be able to make it home that night.!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Porter Airlines customer review,10,2010-05-26,On time departures quick no hassle check-in great in-flight service superb lounge pleasant in-flight staff - a delight. Baggage arrived at carousel in record time!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,9,2010-05-11,The fact they fly into Toronto's downtown airport saving the hour-plus commute is a bonus. Free WiFi coffee and cake in the waiting lounge pleasant staff free snacks and drinks on each flight (wine or beer on afternoon flights) comfortable seats on-time departures and a hassle-free check-in process make flying Porter worthwhile.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,8,2010-03-16,I enjoyed flying Porter out of Toronto into New York. Friendly staff and civilized service. The disappointment was flying back in foggy weather. My flight was redirected to Hamilton because the Island airport doesn't have good navigation systems for landing in fog and Porter's terminal at Pearson doesn't have Customs agents. Porter arranged buses from Hamilton to Toronto so they handled the situation well but the trip took much longer than planned. I would use Porter again for domestic flights but not rely on them for on-time arrival from the US.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,10,2010-01-26,I had a chance to try their service in order to get to Chicago. The flight had a four hour stopover in Toronto but still it was outstanding in every way. The Border officer at Midway Airport was efficient but welcoming. Certainly much better than the experience I had had at O'Hare.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Porter Airlines customer review,7,2009-12-19,Return flight from Ottawa to Toronto. The lounges at both airports are a nice touch with high quality snacks and gourmet coffee. Outbound we got offered the same snacks as served in the lounge with our beverages. Complimentary wine was served in a real glass. Returning (same time of day) we got a lunch box with a half sandwich and cheese and crackers. I would still prefer to fly in a jet than a Dash 8. They claim it to be quiet but its really only quiet compared to other propeller planes. All in all nice service and a good product. But really 20 years ago all the airlines offered a snack lunch free drinks and in a jet. The Toronto Island Airport is a great location but it will be nice when there are some facilities before security to allow people to visit before going through security. One concern is that with the amount of overwater flying Porter undertakes using this airport on Lake Ontario (and now they fly to Newfoundland too) I would have thought that the seat cushions would at least double as flotation devices.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
