"""Decent experience overall""",8,2022-06-28,I got this airline at last moment during checkin at ISB when my ticket of AirAsia found out to be invalid. Decent experience overall.

"""I'm still waiting for my refund""",1,2022-06-22,"Unfortunately chose to make a reservation on Serene for DXB-LHE-DXB dated June 11th for return trip to cherish moments on Eid in town, But, Serene expert side of the things made it worse experience to explore. Payment was successfully charged from my card but airline booking status can't be changed from reservation to issued ticket due to technical error on the part of Serene Air. Initially blame game started by call center that check your bank, later after useless week airline accepted that payment has been claimed by us but we can't validate your respective booking as confirmed. Airline's Dubai office promised that they would refund my payment in cash in two days time, but till now as of June 21st there is nothing. Almost two weeks and I'm still waiting for my refund.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Lahore,June 2022,,,,1,1,,,False
"""14 days later still no refund""",1,2022-05-10,"Flight was cancelled on 26 April by the airline. I am entitled to a full refund. I paid by Credit Card, 14 days later still no refund. Automated standard replies from Customer services, No names of employees and they do not answer the phone. Never book a flight in Pakistan using a credit card, always go to the airport and see which flights are flying that day and pay in cash.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Karachi to Islamabad,June 2021,,,,1,1,,,False

"""Overall, pleasant experience""",8,2020-10-06,"Islamabad to Karachi. I was travelling with this airline with the gap of about 2 years.

"""I was impressed""",10,2019-05-06,My first time flying on SereneAir from Karachi to Islamabad and return I was impressed. The flights left and arrived on time and the cabin crew was courteous and efficient. They are flying relatively new 737-800s with mood lighting and plenty of leg room. Onboard catering was also good. My only complaint is the inability to purchase tickets with a US credit card from their website.,True,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Karachi to Islamabad,April 2019,5,5,,5,5,,,True
"""hope this new airline succeeds""",6,2019-02-23,"Islamabad to Karachi. 11.30pm flight fully booked-had an aisle seat near the back.

"""A very courteous welcome""",9,2018-01-25,"I was hesitant to fly this new airline, but gave it a try. Its website was easy to navigate but there were unresolved issues with credit card payment. Check-in was easy and staff were professional. A very courteous welcome at the aircraft door to every passenger. The all-female staff wore an elegant uniform. I had pre-reserved Seat 3F. I could tell from the cabin interior, its general upkeep and lighting that it was a new aircraft. The cabin was also very clean. Announcements, especially in English, were made in a very warm yet professional manner. Announcements from the cockpit were also nice. Food was average in quality, but enough in quantity. No complaints about it. They served a full dinner on a 9.25pm departure flight! Drinks arrived when I had finished the meal. It seems they finish serving meals first and then bring drink carts. A passenger in front of me got sick. Flight attendants repeatedly inquired about his well-being and asked if he needed any medication or special attention. Flight arrived on time. I hope SereneAir maintains its service standards in future.",True,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Islamabad to Karachi,January 2018,4,5,,4,4,,,True
