My friend who is 186 cm tall had a hard time seating in the middle seat. Despite expensive price for the tickets, Turkish does not allow to choose your own seat - not when you buy nor when you check-in. Seat prices were ridiculously priced, where the extra legroom cost almost 90 EUR per person, per flight. My food was served lukewarm and the fresh bread was served to our hands before we could use their wipes to clean them. Taste was acceptable, portions are somewhat generous but the ingredients were repeating themselves. That includes our return flight.

That would be a message that would have grabbed my attention and led me to make alternative arrangements. No contact from them was made by phone, email or text about this.

Customer Service by Feedback is a brick wall. It is all done by email, and their email response closes the case.

On both flights, they did not note down my request for a child's meal and both times we couldn't complete online check-in, which resulted in us waiting in long queues to receive our boarding passes at the airports at YOW and KUL. Both outbound and inbound flights from Canada and Turkey were relatively full, which was expected with borders opening up all around the world.

The chaos/disorganization among the way the whole ordeal was handled was SO unprofessional . Passengers were instructed several times to move to different lines causing people to lose their places in line; causing more frustration. Since the flight did not show up online or on the app as canceled but rather delayed, we were not able to rebook on our own, even though we had been told it was canceled. The next step we were told to follow was to leave our places in line and go to the baggage claim and bring our luggage back to the check-in counter. The explanation for this was that when we get rebooked, the staff would be able to quickly tag our luggage. Once again, the lines were jumbled and people were angry. The passengers that were in the front of the line lost their places, and many were now in the back. Two areas were made for passengers wanting to cancel their flight and ones who wanted to rebook.

After hours we arrive at a hotel in downtown area where now it was midnight and nothing was open. Stranded without food, toiletries and clean clothes. We were picked up 3.5  hours later and dropped off at the airport. No one could help me from Turkish airlines in the Turkish airport!  Arriving to Serbia I called the call center from Serbia to be told my ticket numbers have changed and that is why can’t access my flights on the app or website any longer. Even with the new numbers still have the same problem. I could not select return flight seats over the phone or online. I was told i had to go to the main office in Belgrade. My husband is 6’6” and needs extra leg room. Not an option. I sent emails to complain about situation and try to receive help to only be told “we are sorry for inconveniences”. Needless to say I am in Belgrade to try and receive help at their office. Worse service ever! “Due to covid” no one in office can do anything other than ticket purchases. I am dreading the flights back home. I will encourage any and all people thinking about traveling with Turkish airlines to reconsider.

As well their customer service agents in the airport are very rude, and abrupt. They made derogatory comments to me in Turkish the customer service agents definitely do not help their customers. I made a complaint to the company and I’m still waiting for a response. Upon my arrival in Istanbul airport on Monday February 14th I immediately called Turkish Airlines for reservation for my cat. I was told (though the representative asked me of the breed and the size of my pet I provided) that the cabin had reached its capacity limit and that the only option I had was to put my cat in the holding cargo. The representative even told me that I must have a hard carrier for my cat since she’s going to be put in the cargo. She then reserved a spot for my cat and told me that I’d receive an email confirmation for the requests. I received two emails. First email was for the cabin and it was not confirmed due to full capacity but second email was confirmed for cargo. The representative did not tell me that my cat was not allowed in the cargo and went ahead with the reservation. Based on the confirmation I received from Turkish Airlines I proceeded with my flight as usual on February 16th. I was held for the entire duration of the check out at Turkish airport with many different excuses from several different agents and scenarios and no clear explanation why I couldn’t fly at that time. The first reason was that my cat couldn’t be in the cargo area because there was a large dog and then the other reason was that I didn’t have sufficient documents and then they said that Because of my cat’s breed (exotic shorthair) I hadn’t reserved for my cat far in advance. I was extremely stressed out and the frustration was unbearable and above all my cat was in a lot of distress and hunger and thirst and no where litter box for her toilet. The Turkish Airlines staff were extremely unprofessional, unhelpful, and rude with me. They all refused to provide me with their name.  I experienced the worst customer service from a big company that I once thought they were a decent airline to fly with.

I gave him the passport thinking ok some resolution finally but he took it went behind the desks, vanished there in the back in the kiosk and came back after 15 min. Asked me again, Food? I said  what's up with flight?. So again we got back in the line up so we could talk to a human maybe.

Lady said the flight that was at 9 is now in the morning (it took me good long time to get this info) she said no hotel we don't accommodate.

Forbid you have a voucher for a reimbursement for future use or whatever reasons, they will not honor it or they will come up with any excuse to cut it in half. I just purchased tickets for my wife and I for travel in February to Istanbul and I had locked my reservations. My wife had an existing voucher and I was paying by Credit card. They have rules that no one knows and they want you to know about these rules after they issue you the voucher, that if you have a voucher you can only redeem that in a sales office in the USA or Turkey or local country of Origin. Try getting a sales office in the USA. There are none and all USA sales office numbers get routed to the call center that has difficulty understanding English. So if one has to redeem a voucher, you can only do that at a Turkish sales office in Turkey. I called the call center, after 20 call attempts since either they had computer errors, or computer was down or they dropped the call, I got an agent, telling me that if I need to ticket my ticket together with my wife, I have to go to the Sales office in USA and or Turkey not willing to understand there are no Sales offices in the USA that are manned unless you have lost baggage. Finally I found a friend, who went to the Istanbul office to book my tickets that were already locked with a price but they ended up charging me and extra $60 for my tickets of $920 (total $980) and $340 for my wifes tickets that had a voucher of $1000 and the tickets were $920. So her tickets actually cost me $1000 from the originally purchase I had made plus $340 extra. Total $1340. Remember I had already locked a price of $1940 for two tickets from the Turkish website and had a reservation code and Paid for the lock of the tickets. The reason for this hike was the new ticket is being booked in Turkey, and the Turkish lira is 14 to a lira and when I was given the voucher for $1000 of refund that Lira was 8liras so I have to pay the 6liras per $1 price difference for the devaluation of currency hence the extra cost is $340 on the new ticket plus the $1000 on the voucher. Where is the logic in this? What happens if there is no one in Turkey to go to the sales office locally? I guess can never use the Voucher.

This years debacle involved Turkish Airlines booking a connecting flight on Alaska Airlines from our home town to LAX where we were to board the Turkish Airlines flight to Istanbul.

"""15-hour flight lasted for three days""",1,2021-07-29,"In Kiev we were registered without any problems for a flight to Vancouver with a transfer in Istanbul. However, apparently the company is guilty of overbooking, of which my son and I became a victim, and, as a result, our 15-hour flight lasted for three days. In Istanbul, the airline gave us an obscure background check on the reasons for entering Canada for my son, who has a valid student visa and study permit. Still in an atmosphere of terrible nervousness, because the check was carried out in the last minutes before going on the plane. In the end, we were allowed to board the plane, but by that time the exit was already closed, the landing was over, and the plane flew to Vancouver without us. There were about 10 people like us on this flight, some returned to Kiev, and some, like us, agreed to fly to Vancouver on the next flight every other day. The fact that all this was not accidental, namely with the aim of weeding out excess passengers, is evidenced by the fact that our luggage did not fly to Vancouver, but somehow also remained in Istanbul. And upon arrival in Canada, it turned out that the question that interested Turkish Airline so much was not at all relevant for the Canadian border guards, since they did not contain any comments regarding the grounds for entering the country. Since we had to wait two days in Istanbul for the next flight, there was a question about the hotel. The airline refused to put us in a hotel. Therefore, we had to pay for accommodation and food in Istanbul out of our own pocket. Although, the legislation in such cases stipulates that the airline must provide such passengers with accommodation and three meals a day and even communication. However, any attempts to prove something were threatened to deprive us of even those tickets for the next flight that we were promised. To top it all off, upon claiming luggage in Vancouver, it turned out that three of our four suitcases were destroyed, broken, torn apart, that is, beyond repair. The day after the flight, I filed a complaint about the suitcases on the airline's website, as well as a complaint demanding to reimburse the cost of the hotel and food in Istanbul, as well as to pay compensation prescribed by law.

After everyone on the plane was asking to land in Chicago because we were flying over it, they instead landed and stranded us in JFK airport in New York.

Everyone who tried to move to a different seat during the flight was forced to return to their assigned seat, even though the plane was almost empty, and several people were forced to go back and sit with people with whom they were not traveling! Unreal! The cleanliness and hygiene was fine. We got a brown paper bag with a kashar cheese sandwich, a cake, a box of fruit juice, and a small bottle of water. Leg room was appalling, but not out of line with most Economy seats. But the fun had only just begun! Upon arrival in Amsterdam, I went to passport control so I could go to the baggage claim, collect my checked bag, and check-in with Delta (via KLM) .. except at passport control, I was told that I was not allowed to enter the EU because of COVID restrictions! So, I walked up to the transfer section, went through the security check, and then tried to find my gate and someone to help me. Because of THY's refusal to check my bag through to another airline, it was removed from the plane, slung onto the belt, and dumped. Without KLM's help, they would have abandoned my checked bag in AMS with no way for me to reclaim it! Thankfully, a KLM agent was extremely helpful, called Swissport with my THY bag claim ticket number, and got it loaded onto my Delta flight. Without her, I would have lost an expensive suitcase full of expensive winter clothes and all of my souvenirs purchased in Istanbul. Thanks a lot, Turkish Airlines!

"""Not worth your money""",3,2020-12-19,"I am Turkish and used THY services more than 10 times in the last 4 years. I believe you should be looking for another airline company if you are not obliged to use their services due to the following reasons: For international flights: THY is, as far as I concern only airline which has a direct flight from Los Angeles - LAX to Istanbul - IST airport. That was the main reason I have decided to use their services again, and I regret my decision not surprisingly. There are two different scenarios: Imagine, you are arranging a flight from LAX to IST, which has a domestic transfer from IST to Izmir Adnan Menderes - ADB airport. They leave only 55 minutes between 2 flights, where you should get into passport check and airport security. As if this wasn't enough, your LAX flight gets delayed 35 mins, and they only postpone your flight for only 5-10 minutes. The cream of the pie was, they assign the domestic transfer gate to the furthest possible one. When you arrive at the gate after having a small running competition and just as you are seeing that they are shutting the gate down, you are being told that it is too late now instead of not shutting down the gate. Then you are going to the ticket office, and they are saying that the next flight is like, 6 hours later. After you have been flown like 13+ hours, you are going to wait 6 more hours. Thanks, that is classy. I will need to buy food, internet and sit here for 6 hours. I have just come here to see my family after three years, and I have only a week here. So, your free ticket doesn't solve the issues, does it? Oh, the second one is even better. The very similar scenario above, but you are flying to Beograde - Tesla Airport (if I remember the name correctly) instead of having a domestic flight. Delays only 15 mins, but you had 45 mins between 2 flights.  For domestic flights: Well, this is a short one. You are arriving at the airport 70 mins before the flight and arriving at the counter 57-58 mins before the flight. You will walk only 5 mins to reach the gate after the counter. But they are telling you ""sir, you should've been here 60 mins before"". So, you buy another ticket from another airline. General: Food was a disaster.  Not only because of pandemic considerations but also managed poorly, and their attitude confirms their current position.  As common sense, If it takes 25 mins to walk to the transfer gate and if there are both passport and security check, then you don't assign 1 hour between flights. Easy.

"""gave up before ever boarding a plane""",1,2020-12-17,"I can’t post a review about my trip with Turkish Airlines, because I gave up before ever boarding a plane. My many contacts with their support system finally wore me down at the end. All four sectors of my flight has been cancelled one by one over the last few months, which I can accept due to the Covid situation. Problem is that every cancellation forced me into the arms of the call center. I have learned a few things from these interactions. Be prepared to press a lot of numbers on the phone before talking to a human. Very few of the agents seems able to make a decision without talking to a supervisor while you are waiting. If the answer you finally get from an agent seems strange/weird/stupid don’t give up. Call back, talk to another agent and ask the same question. In my experience there is a good chance you will get a different answer. There seem to be an arcane way of doing things in this company. At one point I had to pay a fee for a date change on one of my flights, but none of the agents were able to tell me how much the fee would be. I got guesses ranging all the way from 50 to 400 euros. “Someone for another department will call you, calculate the fee and arrange the payment”, I was told. So I waited for a day, two days and finally after five days, I called back asking about the fee. Again I was told “Somebody from another department will call you, calculate the fee and arrange payment”, I was told again. “When do you thing it will happen”, I asked. “Maybe one more week. I don’t know. But if you not hear anything, you should call back”, said the agent. So after another week I gave up.  And since I couldn’t cancel the ticket online, I had my last encounter with the call center. Here is a play by play: Me: Hello I want to cancel my ticket. Agent 1: I can’t do that for you. I will transfer you. Me: Hello I want to cancel my ticket. Agent 2: I can’t do that. You have to go to one of our offices. Me: The one nearest to my home (90 min away) have been closed due to Covid. The one in Copenhagen (4 hours away) is listed as “temporarily closed” on your homepage. Agent 2 (after a long pause): You can send them an email. Me: I did that 3 days ago. I haven’t received a reply. Agent 2: You can send them another one. Me: Listen, I just want to cancel the ticket. Agent 2.: Okay I will cancel it for you.

"""cost-cutting on whatever they can""",1,2020-09-01,"Turkish Airlines (THY) used to have one of the best business class on short haul flights within Europe. Not anymore. At first, it might seem that certain elements of the older days' business class are unavailable due to some sanitary measures against the coronavirus. At least, this is what Turkish Airlines will try to make you believe in. Yet, on a closer look, you just realize that they are cost-cutting on whatever they can, even if their business class tickets cost as much as they did when it was good. What I find offensive as a customer is that deception of its customers is part of the economic model here.  They no longer serve you a proper warm meal in the business class and try to say that it is due to some anti-virus measures. But Lufthansa and many other airlines still do that with an additional measure of a transparent plastic cover on the top of your dining tray. If those airlines can, why cannot THY? The cold meal box that they provide (as an allegedly ""safer"" option) is so cheap that it just ""screams"" from within ""we are cost-cutting!"". For example, if hummus can be put there into that small covered round plastic bowl, why cannot they serve a proper dessert like say a chocolate mousse? And how is it more ""dangerous"" to serve a decent dessert in the same container in which they serve you their hummus anyway? Instead you get a Snickers bar as your dessert! Yes, a junk food in the business class! No more Champagne or French wines. Again, the board attendants will tell you this is because of the virus. Yet, the small bottles of a cheaper Turkish wines by Kavaklidere are still available (not for long may be). When you ask how is Kavaklidere wine brand ""safer"" than Louis Eschenauer wines or Piper-Heidsieck champagne that they used have you should not, of course, expect any satisfactory answer. Overall, both food and drink experience on board is just an impoverished version of what it used to be. They did not even have a Turkish ayran. The same is with the business lounge at the Istanbul airport. And given the examples I made, it is clear that these drastic downgrading in quality is far from being owned exclusively to precautions again the virus. Again, it is fine if an airline chooses a cost-cutting business model. But what is not fine is that they still sell you their ""business class"" for an old price which is nowadays a premium economy at best. So in the end, as a customer I feel tricked and deceived and realize that it is at the expense of customers like me that THY is trying to compensate for their losses by selling me the business class for an old price and then cost-cutting on my travel experience so that there is a larger net income from their new, downgraded ""business class"" ticket sales.

This was my first time traveling with Turkish Airlines and after the experience I’ve had I pray it was my last as well. I was travelling with my family of four (me, my husband, and my 2 kids). We couldn’t preselect the seats since the airline didn’t enable the online check-in which I’m assuming was to a measure taken to ensure social distancing on the flight. They placed us all separately, when I asked why they said it was because of the social distancing measures that we were placed rows apart next to strangers. Me and my husband were placed towards the front while my kids were seated right next to each other at the very back of the flight. My husband was placed one seat apart from whoever was next to him, however I was placed right next to some strangers with an empty seat next to the three of us - my kids were placed directly next to a stranger who turned out to be the mother of one who was also placed away from her kid. Soon we found out that most families were separated this way, which to me is pretty pointless.  I think if they were going to place people right next to each other they very well could’ve placed families AKA people of the same household next to each other instead. A few families were complaining about this prior to take off to which the crew responded very disrespectfully, (they went as far as name calling the passengers out loud) they kept on repeating this was ITA law, and they had to abide by it. They even called ground staff for one of the families. Thankfully the ground staff was way more reasonable and polite then the crew members. They shuffled a few people around including my kids very respectfully and without causing any more chaos. After the ground staff left one of the crew members returned to the family they primarily called the ground staff for and demanded they thank her because she “solved their problem” and proceeded to call the father an idiot once again. After witnessing all this my kids were terrified to move in fear of the crew disrespecting us in the same manner, despite the ground staff’s clearance. They were scared. Then came the flight from Istanbul to Manchester. This flight was fully booked there wasn’t a single seat that was empty. The cherry on top of this cake from hell was the food. Due to Covid-19 to reduce contact with staff they only served us once on both the 8hr and the 4hr flight with the same exact food.

"""disgusting way they mistreat clients""",1,2020-07-30,"The coronavirus-related compensation programmes announced by Turkish Airlines are there just to fob clients with empty promises. They refuse to apply them and do not follow ticket change/refund terms as advertised on their website. I had a flight booked with Turkish Airlines from Montreal to Sofia in second half of March 2020. I could not travel due to rapidly evolving pandemic situation, with new travel advisories and restriction imposed, and borders closed literally every 24 hours. At that time, Turkish Airlines had already cancelled virtually all European flights as of March 14 and had announced seemingly customer friendly compensation policies such as the Open Ticket and the Zero Change Fee. Back then, I called Turkish Airlines customer center, explained precisely my case, provided airline confirmation number and they told me my ticket was cancelled and I was eligible for free ticket change under their Zero Change Fee policy. Whenever I’d decide my new dates of travel, I should simply call them back for issuing my new ticket – that’s what they told me and this fact is well documented. Beginning of July I contacted them to request ticket change for a flight in August for the same destination and same cabin class as per the Zero Change Fee policy terms. It’s been 3 weeks now and I still do not have my new ticket issued. During that time I spend a lot of time calling Turkish Airlines call center, speaking to customer care department, writing several feedbacks through the form on their website. They would not take responsibility, I was given a bunch of ridiculous explanations and excuses, even got shameful demands to collect fare difference or cabin class ‘upgrade’ for more money, all of which contradicts the published terms of their Zero Change Fee policy. So, bottom line is that they do not adhere to the terms of announced policies, waste customers time and deride customers by asking them to contact third parties or their sales offices that may be closed, despite their website states clearly that all requests can be completed by calling the call center or online, as I was told back in March. Their call center and feedback form is a complete waste of time, they are not there to solve problems, but just to lead customers to a dead end – replies are but general wording and one can clearly see nobody in their customer care department is really following your case, aware of details or even reading what you wrote to them.

"""mistreatment by Turkish Airlines""",1,2019-12-20,"Not Verified |  I'm writing this review in my room in Yotel Air (hotel) inside Istanbul airport after having been denied my right to board a flight to Berlin with Turkish Airlines by a member of their staff earlier today (12:30 PM, December 19, 2019). I had to book a room in this hotel for an overnight stay and buy a new ticket for the earliest flight to Berlin tomorrow (December 20, 2019) without any compensation from Turkish Airlines. All this was due to the fact that said staff had no knowledge of Schengen visa regulations involving non-EU nationals/passports. I am devastated by this mistreatment by Turkish Airlines. I was supposed to fly with Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to Berlin at 12:30 PM earlier today (December 19, 2019), but I was denied boarding by a ground staff member who was in charge of checking passengers' passports and boarding passes at the gate because he assumed that I did not have a VISA/permit to enter Germany. I explained very clearly in simple English that I did not require a VISA to enter Germany and the Schengen Area for tourism purposes for up to 90 days, as my country is included in one of the non-EU countries to which the VISA requirement does not apply (for tourism purposes). He dismissed my claim (which I understand, given the priority for security) and went on to make calls and texts to verify my claim. In the meantime, he made me wait on the side while he attended to all the other passengers who were entering the gate. Because there was no conclusive answer from the other side of the phone, he and his team decided to let the plane leave without me. Not long after the plane had left, he finally got a confirmation from ""Germany border controls"" that my claim that I did not need a VISA for visiting Germany was correct. Then, he took me to a Turkish Airlines booth (airside) to get me rebooked on another flight. After exchanging a few sentences with the Turkish Airlines ticketing team, he left there unattended. He did not say sorry to me. After waiting for four hours for a confirmation from the ticketing team about my next flight, they said to me that I would need to buy a new ticket because my original ticket was a ""promotional"" ticket. I defended myself saying that I did not miss my flight. Rather, I was denied boarding because one of their ground staff members assumed that I needed a VISA permit and did not have one. I rang Turkish Airlines's Customer Service to get help and explained the whole situation via phone and then email. After two hours, they responded to my email say they could not compensate me and even defended said staff for denying me my right to board the plane in the interest of protecting all Turkish Airlines's customers and passengers (was I not a customer?). What broke my heart was the Turkish Airlines team being adamant that it was somehow my mistake - they mentioned ""incomplete documents"", ""invalid visa"" etc. But I never needed a VISA in the first place. Finally, I had no choice but to buy another ticket for a flight the next morning and book a room at the hotel inside the airport. All this without so much as ""sorry"", let alone compensation. I'm now very apprehensive about going to Europe via Istanbul. I've been traveling to Europe since I was 18. I have never been denied boarding until now.

We were taken in a hot bus from the terminal to the aircraft, then made to wait as we couldn't board. An hour after take off they came to take a drinks order. I chose a gin and tonic and was offered ice and lemon which I chose. Almost half an hour after that my drink came. A glass with a small piece of lemon; no ice, and tellingly, not a single bubble in the liquid. I tasted it and suspect it was vodka and still water. I told the attendant it was obviously not gin and tonic and she said she would change it. But by now they had started serving dinner so I opted for a glass of wine, guessing they couldn't get that wrong. The salmon starter was excellent. After that I had selected the pea soup and fish. But she brought me chicken kebab. She changed it. I was asked what I would like for desert and I replied that I would chose from the trolley. She said they don’t do the desert trolley any more. I wonder if it doesn’t fit as the aisles are so narrow it is a squeeze for two people to pass. I had some delicious ice cream then the cheese plate. The latter was so cold and the cheeses so hard they had no taste. Also I had to ask for bread or crackers to go with the cheese. Then to sleep. First problem was getting flat. Although I am average height I couldn't get my feet far enough into the feet area to lower the rest of my body on to the bed. A steward saw the problem and explained that the only way is to raise the bed half up after they have made it.

When I asked how this could happen when I had called and already had confirmed seats, the guy at the gate (part of cabin crew) was extremely rude and replied very rudely that he doesn’t know what happened but he is trying to help us find a seat. Apparently he did not think anything of letting a 3 year old and a 6 year old sit together. The two female flight attendants were a bit nicer and they said to him in Turkish that a child cannot sit alone (they were speaking in Turkish but I could tell that’s what they said because they pointed to my kids).  Staff is so unprofessional and rude. When we checked in, we simply asked reason for not assigning seats together (please note that I had called the airline and made sure that we have seats together), the person on the desk was rude and was not replying to our questions. He simply gave the reason, in broken English, that the plane has changed that caused the problem when we asked why it was taking so long to check us in and if everything was ok. However, plane was not changed and he simply lied to us. Poor communication skills: The big problem was, they don’t understand/speak English well. When we asked reason why they assigned our confirmed seats to someone else, the person on the check-in counter could not explain in English and he got frustrated as he as was trying to explain in broken English which was hard for us to understand. In his frustration, he stated showing his rudeness. The same situation was on the plane, whey they were trying to get seats for us, we asked crew members how did this happen? they simply could not reply in English and ultimately replied with rudeness, again it was language problem but I feel that the females were nicer than the man at the door of the plane, who was part of the cabin crew. The other guy was polite and ok who was serving me food but the guy at the door (part of the cabin crew) was extremely rude). He was the one we asked how this could happen when our flight was confirmed and he responded rudely. We asked if at least two of us could sit together behind each other (2 seats in front and 2 in back) and he said yes and told mom and daughter to follow him (all the way to row 27), yet dad and son were told to wait there and were given seats in row 9. Mom was waiting for dad and son to show up close to mom and daughter, but that did not happen. Dad in row 9, had to call a flight attendant and ask where mom and daughter were.

After arriving at the airport to Istanbul I came to the Turkish airline front desk to ask them about the hotel service. Since my layout time is 13 hours they supposed to offer me to stay in the hotel, and for this reason, I have chosen this airline. It is their written policy. I’ve been waiting in the line for about 30 minutes. The representative told me that there is some update on my flight, they have alternative flight that is sooner than 13 hours and they cannot offer me the hotel, but at the same time they cannot offer me a new ticket to the alternative flight; moreover, I must pay extra money for that ticket. They changed the airport of arrival so why do I need to pay in this case? Is it legal at all? I just want to mention that when I was booking my tickets these 13 hours connection time and old airport were the only options. Their system does not show any other flights. After I have been waiting for his decision more than 30 minutes at the front desk, he told me that he even cannot check that alternative flight for me and provide with some more information about its costs or how can I get that ticket. He said that I need to go to another front desk that is after security check out. I went to another front desk and there was a huge line of yelling people who missed their flight because of the delay. I was patiently waiting for another one and a half hour in the line and after, another representative told me the same story that I must pay extra money for upgrading my ticket because they are not going to provide me the hotel room. They said that since there is another option for me to get to Kyiv earlier and I need to pay for that, they cannot give me the room. Representatives were referring to their policy about offering the free hotel room. I want to mention that six months ago when I was purchasing my tickets there were NOT other option with layout less than 13 hours, 13 hours layout was the only option on their website that’s why I bought it because they provide a hotel to stay that 13 hours. They told me that I can contact their manager which is located on Turkish Airline Hotel Desk after Passport control. I went there.

In order to receive this seat with my family and babies - we have to pay an additional $109 per person, per seat - going both ways round trip! That’s over $600 extra for my family.

"""rude and lacked any empathy""",1,2019-05-24,"Kiev to Male via Istanbul. Two days lost and headaches all the way to our wedding. Horrible experience from start to finish with Turkish Airlines on our wedding/honeymoon trip from Kiev to Maldives. Sorry for the lengthy post. I will try to make it as concise as possible. Website and Mobile App issues: After creating my online profile, I needed to update my name to include my middle name, as it shows on my passport. Once my tickets were issued from Expedia, Turkish Airlines website and App couldn’t link the ticket to my Miles&Smiles profile because of the name discrepancy. It took several calls and emails to support, and even now it still shows my first name and middle name combined. Couldn’t update my rewards number: I mistakenly had the wrong Miles&Smiles number on my Expedia account when I purchased the tickets (copy/pasted without the last digit). Turkish airlines couldn’t update my ticket with the correct rewards number. Sure, it was my mistake, but it seemed like a simple request to update my ticket. Flight schedule change: Our flight times from IST to MLE on April 30th change from arriving at 11:50am to arriving 12:15pm, which was not a big deal, but logging into their website and App the system asked me to confirm the change, cancel the flight, or change the flight. There was no option to confirm the change. I couldn’t change my flight (which was free of charge). Every time I’d select the new flight arriving in MLE at 12:15, the system would say it couldn’t find a flight with that time. I made several calls to Turkish Airlines support, and they never helped me clarify if I was confirmed on the changed flight. The best they could do was tell me to contact Expedia and have them re-issue tickets. Between Turkish Airlines and Expedia support, I must have made a half dozen calls regarding this. By the end, Turkish airlines best response was that “everything should be fine”. All I wanted to know is that everything IS fine”. Cancelled flight from KBP to IST: As we were about to board our flight from KBP to IST on April 29th at 9:30pm, we were told at the gate that our flight was cancelled. • It took 6 hours to stand in line for new tickets. Calling customer support, the guy was rude and told me to just wait in line. When calling Expedia’s Gold customer support to get me a new flight, they were unable to assist because the Turkish Airlines flight was not showing an updated status, and that the flight was still on-time. Expedia could have helped me get new tickets, but they just needed to confirm the flight was cancelled. Expedia even called Turkish Airlines to get updates, and Turkish Airlines was unable to give them the cancelled status. So, after several calls to Turkish airlines and Expedia, we just continued to wait in line. We eventually got new tickets to IST, which left Kiev at 10am the next day (April 30th) and arrived in IST at 12pm. However, our connection from IST to MLE was at 1:00am that morning on April 30th, arriving in MLE at 12:15pm.

I doubt it I think it’s pure lies) Anyway I said I want my baggage back please get it to me! Oh you know it might take couple of days. Fine I said just get it please! Few days later I rang again because nothing came and find out that delivery man came to the hotel in Eilat asked for me but because me and my spouse have different surnames he was told that there’s no such person registered (but then the question is how could he leave it there if he was told the person is not there) Again I was promised that few days later I will get it. As you can imagine I didn’t. Rang again today asked for the manager (was told the manager is in holiday) got to speak to supervisor and what a surprise she said that the baggage is not in the hotel in Eilat but in airport Eilat and because it’s holiday (Pesah) the airport is closed and they can’t get it.

When I received an email to check-in, I was unable to do so. I decided to call them to inquire why. They told me they cancelled my reservation and my credit card was flagged as fraud. I was told to provide proof that the credit card belonged to me so I did. First of all, why was I not notified that they cancelled my reservation? I even received an email notification to remind me to check-in… After a long day of correspondence, they emailed me saying I can get the flight for the same price that I originally paid. I called to book my flight and they said it wasn’t going through again so I had to use a different credit card. The Turkish Airlines representative then confirmed my payment went through and checked me in online. Great! I finally have a reservation since it was less than 7 hours till departure. When I went to drop off my bag at the Dubai airport, the Turkish Airlines representative said that there was no reservation for me. I showed him my confirmation AND showed him my online credit card statement that showed I had a charge from Turkish Airlines. He repeatedly told me I no longer have a reservation and need to buy a new ticket with a travel agency at the airport. He also told me I would be fully refunded when I submit a claim with Turkish Airlines. Again, why wasn’t I notified that they cancelled my reservation? Why did they cancel my reservation after they already charged my credit card? It was 1 hour until departure so I did exactly what the Turkish Airlines representative told me to do. I bought a ONE WAY flight for $1306.98!! Since my flight in April, I’ve had a nonstop battle trying to get my refund.

Why is their protocol to respond within 7 days or 48 hours, but it’s been 2 months now and I haven’t heard from them yet? Why did they not follow the proper protocol in the very beginning when I booked my flight? Why didn’t they ever notify me that they cancelled my reservation? Why did their own employee confirm my payment went through and check me in? Why did they cancel my reservation when they already charged me? Why did their own employees tell me that they’ll fully refund me, but aren’t now? Why are they completely ignoring me? I feel like everyone should be aware how horrible Turkish Airlines is. I hope no one else has to go through what I’ve been through. It’s been seriously affecting my health dealing with them.

I flew from Montreal to Istanbul and from the beginning I felt the experience to be flawed. There were some 28 business class seats and I had chosen a seat with direct aisle access. The seat is quite comfortable and large was what I noticed at first. The cabin crew was awful. They congregated at the forward cabin near the bar and watched us settle in. As we were in the middle of winter, passengers all had heavy winter coats. I was seated in row two and could overhear some passengers asking the crew if they could take their coats. I was a bit taken aback by the crews response: ""No, later, later"". Needless to say, I was not going to go out of my way to ask them to take my coat and instead opted to leave it at my seat. The crew members did not offer to take my coat nor my neighbour's at any time during this 9,30 hour flight. We sat in the cabin at our seats with no drinks offered, no water bottle for at least 15 minutes. The crew came by after 15 minutes to offer us a selection of non alcoholic beverages. I declined the drink and was asked if I wanted anything else and I ordered champagne. All drinks during our entire flight were served with no napkin and I thought this to be a bit odd since you get a napkin in Canada even on low cost carriers! Menus were handed out and we were asked for our selection later on. After take off, the service was not well planned. It took a while before any crew member came by and when they did they offered to make our beds! We had just left Montreal at 1045 pm and I suspect this is why they were asking us prior to even taking a drink order! I declined the offer for bedding and informed they that I would be ready for it after dinner. ""Of Course Sir, anything you want"". The response lacked being genuine and I felt the crew was somewhat irked. The service began with handling out a bottle of water, 40 minutes into the flight.

He would take the order for 3-5 seats at a time and then disappear. The whole order taking for the entire business class must have taken 40 minutes. The food was served and it was beautifully plated. I can't say the food tasted better than any other overseas carrier I've flown in business class. The onboard chef seemed like it was all a show and I could not really see how he was a chef. He took our order (chefs don't usually do this) and made sure the plates looked nice. I think that is the extent of it and I don't really see any exotic or added value to this.During the whole meal, my drinks went dry for 10 or more minutes at a time.

I selected this long layover knowing that I had much shorter routes with the only intention of taking the Sunday 4:00 pm free tour around the city that Turkish Airlines provides to it´s travelers when they have long wait at the airport. Prior my flight, I confirmed via phone with Turkish Airlines that there was no need to make a reservation and that as long as 1 person would like to make the tour, that would be sufficient to do it and that I needed to be at hotel desk 30 min before the start. As soon as we landed I rushed to the desk office but the passport control took about 50 minutes and I arrived at the desk at 3:50 pm (20 min later than expected). Although I was late, I did see that the tour group was there with the guide, getting ready to leave. I asked at the desk if I could join and they told me ""No, tour is finished"". I was not going to take no for an answer as I had chosen Turkish Airlines and a 11 hours layover flight (instead of 3) to jump on that tour. The manager approached me in a very rude way and told me that she had to leave and that the buses were full. She said that she could put me in the tour but that there was no space for me (in the website clearly states that as long as 1 person will be interested in the tour, it will be arranged). According to her excuse, she had 62 people ready to go and that was exactly the maximum amount that she could take. It is interesting, to say the least, that apparently I was so unlucky that I was the only person that was left out out of an exact number of 62 people. It is really hard to believe that the group of tourist standing next to me at that same moment was 62, when it looked more like 20 people. This person was extremely rude and zero customer oriented and did nothing to help me in that situation or to find an alternative. All she did was to yell at me and say that if I was not happy that I should open a claim (so that's what I'm doing now).

The flight was delayed almost one hour due to a technical problem. Due to this delay we missed the connecting flight to Toulouse. Turkish Airlines staff were incredibly unhelpful and uncaring. The sales desk demanded I buy new tickets at a price of R40,000 ($2,800) and I refused. Customer service was pathetic. The helpline from the sales desk needed a Turkish speaker to understand the process. I was on the phone for over 30 minutes twice explaining what had happened, and was told to to wait a few hours. They would call or email me; but there is no free WiFi or cell phone signal in the arrival terminals. I checked in every couple hours for 12 hours.  The sales desk said they could not give me free connecting flights as the flight was full and the cost was R40,000 ($2,800). They could give me next day tickets to Paris, which is at least 8 hours drive from my destination.  Istanbul airport staff in general were a nightmare to speak to in English, with an attitude of indifference. They were callous and rude at every encounter even though I was friendly, polite and upbeat. From 6 am until 2pm we had no access to proper food or drinks, except pretzels and sweets from a kiosk.  We slept in the airport on the benches - my wife and I with two hyper active kids aged 6 and 8. It was a nightmare. Waited 24 hours before the next flight, and 12 of those hours we were anxious and traumatized by the situation and staff. Arrived in Paris next day, only to find baggage had not been forwarded. This after I had discussed how the baggage worked. I saw the consultant print the new baggage tags and make changes on the system. Filled in the missing baggage report at the airport. Baggage arrived 5 days later by courier. Broken. The telescopic handle was broken off and the hard case was cracked about 15 cm. A soft case had holes in from friction. I've reported this to customer service and received no response except an automated message.  I've attempted to claim compensation on the baggage delay, but the website form doesn't work. We came from super hot summer in South Africa to - 2 degree winter and needed to buy new shoes, jackets and other basics for 4 people at a cost of $800.

The system allowed the check-in and did not see anything wrong in the combination of flights. We call the customer service to make a change of flight three times and in all times the agent was unhelpful, unready for a conversation, and insisted that if we wanted to make it to Beirut, the only option would be leaving on the 23rd of December to arrive on the 24th, knowing that our initial booking was departure and arrival on December 21st. The only other option given was to fly on the 25th or get reimbursed with the ticket price paid in July to be able to buy a new ticket on another airline the day of the flight, which of course you understand how ridicule this is. So being scared to miss the opportunity to see my family this Christmas, we took the 23rd December option. After that, I researched more thoroughly the options and discovered that they were other options that made us get in time for our connection flight on the 21st, with available seats, that the agent had not only not offered, but also assured there were none. I confirmed with another Turkish airlines agent the availability of taking this flight I found, me, the client, who did what they were supposed to do if they were competent. However, now that I had agreed on the change of ticket for the 23rd, to be able to make my new change, policies applied all of the sudden, when they were completely at fault since the beginning. To make the change we had to pay a 100€ per person plus airport taxes plus the difference in price for the tickets which changed from 360€ per person to 680€ per person, which is completely scandalous since so far, all problems come from a failed system that never notified us about a change in flights, an agent who didn't do his job, and a customer service that is completely indifferent.

We had to wait like more than half an hour for the passport control due to the congestion, noting that not all counters were available. Then, the staff were shouting on us to remove our shoes and get in the scanner machine and all do not speak English so we had many difficulties to understand what they want. How come that an international airport has only Turkish speaking staff, and rude staff. Next, we went to check in with tax refund process, and here, in this airport happens what does not happen in any airport in the world: They need to check your baggage, you have to open and search for the items in the airport in order to have your invoices stamped. What a shame. We got delayed due to this process, but still we were safe and on time. Due to the disorganization and the non helpful staff who were shouting on us and telling us to move faster when scanning our items, we lost a cell phone. We were told we had to go to the lost and found office and everyone you ask in this airport tells you to go in wrong directions so we got lost. We lost lots of time and we arrived at the gate 15 mins earlier, after running miles and miles to reach our gate after 15 mins of running. The staff taking care of checking passports was still available in the gate but refused to check our passports since boarding had ended 2 mins ago. We had to buy new tickets, even though we were at the airport and we checked in on time. Concerning Turkish airlines, we were told that we had to pay only the fare rates which is not too much because we are transferring our tickets, and we were surprised to know that the fare rates were higher than a brand new ticket. So we bought new tickets for all of us. Also to mention that we were told by the transfer desk of Turkish airlines and by the sales office of Turkish airlines that our bags were unloaded and they will be transferred to our new ticket. However, our bags arrived to Beirut with the flight that we missed, and when we were complaining about our bags they did not help us and were insisting that the bags are still in Turkey, till we showed them the pictures of our bags with our parents in Beirut, who managed to take them from Beirut international airport.

Instead of being allocated the row as promised by the check-in attendant, seats 15E and 15F were allocated to two other passengers meaning that not only was this trivial attempt at recognition of our honeymoon trip not honoured, but we had to sit apart for the entire 9 hour journey to Mauritius! We were also told that we could not change seats even by the cabin crew when I spoke with them. A similar lack of empathy for our honeymoon was demonstrated by Turkish Airlines on our return journey also. In summary, if you are planning for a special trip (E.g.

We went to the lost & found offices of 3 airports in turkey - Istanbul, Kayseri and Nevsehir, all of them got us to ""contact a different department"", bla bla bla, basically shrugging off responsibility and bringing us all over the world. When the baggage finally arrived at our hotel, it was an 18 hour delay. That's normal. What wasn't normal was that there were no forms to sign to acknowledge receipt of the baggage! The handling company said that ""we are a third party engaged by the airline"" and there was nothing to sign! While outsourcing of such responsibilities are normal, all other courier companies have let me sign a document at the point of collection to acknowledge receipt as well as to document the time of baggage arrival. So the story continues. When we finally managed to get our hands on a PIR, it was a computer generated one with no letterhead, no company stamp and no signature. A 9-year old could have reproduced the same document using MS word. Most importantly, it did not even state the eventual time of baggage arrival. How is any insurance company going to process a claim if a PIR does not state the time of baggage arrival?

The delay is over three hours and they will reimburse the delay and the cost for the visa. In practice it is not easy to contact them, but finally I managed to get a customer service ticket. After 10 days a lot of regrets and a calculation that it was not their fault. They managed the calculation in such a way that the cause of the delay was only one minute less then the reimbursement threshold. Obviously the calculation was manipulated. For visa cost they advised to issue a new ticket with prove of cost made. I issued that request and asked for underlying documentation to support their calculation. After a while THY sent a voucher for the cost and did not respond on the question of proof. The voucher can be used only at the nearest sales office, and is valid for one year.

"""told my return had been cancelled""",1,2018-05-17,"On a recent ‘round-trip’ experience, Denpasar - Budapest, I found myself in multiple disappointing (borderline traumatic) situations with Turkish Airlines. When checking in on my return flight in Budapest in May, 2018, I was told that my return ticket had been cancelled. As a result, I was forced to pay an additional $1,600 to purchase a new one-way ticket on the same flight. Below is a description of what had happened. In April, on the third leg of my flight from Denpasar to Budapest, I missed the flight in Istanbul due to confusion at the gate - poor communication and gate location (ie. heavy traffic surrounding this specific gate, the sitting area hosted multiple flights, unclear instructions and lack of announcements, etc). I had been sitting at the gate for an hour when they started boarding, but was only alerted when priority boarding started --- no more announcements or callouts were made thereafter. When the line began to peter out I started to get a bit concerned, but because there were still so many people sitting around me, which I had presumed they were waiting for the same plane, and no final announcements or staff had called out, I didn’t move forward. However, at that time I did ask the people around me what flight they were waiting for, but they just shook their heads and said they did not speak English. At this point I was growing quite concerned and so I ran to the closest Turkish Airlines staff I could find, at a nearby counter. When I showed him my ticket, he began shouting (actually) at me and said that the gate was now closed and I had to go downstairs to the transfers desk. This was only a minute or two after the gate had been closed. I ran downstairs, showed them my ticket and asked what could be done. They said that I had to purchase a new ticket - no alternative was given. To do so, they ordered me to purchase a visa and exit through customs. When outside, I first rushed to ticketing at Turkish Airlines where an employee stated that I had to purchase a new ticket, but that he could not do anything for me and to go see the Turkish Airlines check-in desk. I then proceeded to the check-in desk at Turkish Airlines and they said that I had to purchase a new ticket. At no time I was told that this would render my return flight invalid, and no other information was given. I tried the help-phone for Turkish Airlines as well, but there was no dial tone and no-one was in the area to provide assistance. I finally had to purchase a one way ticket from Istanbul to Budapest for 200 Euros for a flight later that day. To add insult to injury, the Turkish Airlines staff was appalling - I was yelled at and belittled on numerous occasions. I've read other reviews and some have said that Turkish Airlines employees are inhumane, and to be honest, I agree - note: this is specific to the Istanbul Airport staff. My original ticket was over $1,400, and this whole ordeal has cost me an additional $2000.

Desperately looking for options, I went around the airport talking to every staff I came across, explaining my situation and they all told me only the (non-existent) Turkish staff could help me. Fast forward to 7 pm, (already forced to meet miss my actual flight) I finally meet the ticketing staff of Turkish airlines. I explained her my situation and tell her how I am a student planning to go home and I have already brought a connecting domestic flight back in Nepal to go from Kathmandu to home and that if I did not make this flight I would lose that ticket too. Then all she does is to tell me that I should have known that Canada requires a visa and that it is my fault. Stunned at her response, I tried to reason with her about how it is unreasonable to expect the customer to know this beforehand and that it is the airlines responsibility to let the customer know of such peculiar cases. After discussing for several minutes, she tells me that there is another flight leaving directly from Boston to Istanbul and that there is only one seat left and it will cost me USD 691 to transfer to this flight. Also she told me that if I had called the customer service immediately after this happened and changed the flight, I would not have had to pay the fine. (which is odd because my customer service call was never answered). I felt betrayed and sad at how the people who are supposed to help you make your life miserable. Although the hospitality of the staff in the plane was good, I felt deeply unsatisfied because of what I had to go through.

Boarding for the CPT – IST flight started an hour before take-off, which seemed excessive. The business class cabin has a utilitarian décor of shades of grey – no middle-eastern bling or graduated, coloured lighting here. The staggered 2:2:2 seating pattern affords reasonable privacy, although passengers in window seats still have to climb over their neighbour’s legs. Cabin crew use a counter at the front of the cabin to prepare the food and drink service; it’s probably best for that to be done behind the scenes.

The food service got off to a flying start with LED candles, laying out one’s tray and then the starter options where wheeled past. In principle, one could have as much as one wanted. The meze and mushroom soup were delicious. Less good were the main courses, which were, curiously, both overcooked and barely warm. A trolley of desserts and a cheese plate restored one’s faith in the presence of the on-board chef. Wines were largely Turkish, but the cabin crew seemed clueless about them. The cabin crew in general were efficient but somewhat robotic. Announcements from the cockpit lacked the friendliness of British Airways pilots.

Being respectful about these issues goes a long way. Nevertheless, the crew were professional and quite nice. The business class cabin is quite impressive! Lot’s of leg room, very comfortable seats, very large screens, quality headphones. I was able to sleep for 5 hours, which is out of the ordinary on board an aircraft for me. The food was ok, very well presented. We like these candlelight dinners which no other airlines offers to our knowledge. The negative side to this trip though is that we constantly had to beg for a glass of wine. We had just flown on Thai and Singapore and right after you sit down before take-off, they come to offer Champagne, water and juice. Not so with Turkish, they only offer a selection of 4 types of lemonade. When they take your meal order they ask if you want a glass of wine with your main course. No cocktail whatsoever before the meal is offered. If you dare ask for a glass of wine it is secretly poured behind a counter in front of the cabin.

The information was captured inaccurately, I just had one way ticket that was outbound with my return date on it. Confident that this is an easy fix after years of travelling with other gulf region airlines, I immediately reach out to the Sales Office in Atlanta which rings endlessly without any answers. Very surprised but again in good faith reached out to the call center number provided. This was a nightmare, the first agent could barely speak English and any attempt to get the name was met with callous response of – why are you calling. Speaking very slowly and clearly as it was obvious there was minimal comprehension, agent also confirming he could not understand leaving me very confused I patiently informed of the situation explaining that I was looking for a round trip ticket but believed there was a technical issue as screens kept switching between 2 versions on the portal. Eventually I was transferred to another department which I was informed would resolve the issue and unprofessionally transferred. I had to go through the same process. On the 6th when calling in for a status, as I tried to review the issue to the first agent, she told me she doesn’t have to talk to me if I was calling for a status and I had to persist that she could not treat customers that way.

There is no transport from the lounge to the gate for lesser abled people. All they offer is booking a wheelchair. How are you supposed to push somebody in a wheelchair while also carrying two handbags, a trolley and a guitar. Other airports/airlines have buggies at their disposal. Considering that some gates are 15 minutes walk, this is pretty poor. When flying from an apron gate (7xx e.g. 700), there are no business class buses for business class travelers and you're expected to stand in the bus for 20 minutes or so while it fills up until people step onto each others toes and everybody is squashed in. When questioning the ground staff on why there is no business class bus unlike like we were told at check-in, they said 'economics' and that business class buses are only available for incoming and domestic flights - very poor show. My overall rating of 6 explained: - on-board service & food: 8 - on-board cleanliness of toilets: 5 (floor's often wet) - lounge services & food: 8 - male lounge staff: 5 (often loud or shouting across the room) - female lounge staff: 9 - ground services (bus/transport): 0",False,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Istanbul to London,November 2017,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",1,4,,True,3

I also met the other requirements such as being in transit from a Turkish Airlines flight to another Turkish Airline flight that was international as well as the connection flight being the only option hence being forced by the Turkish Airlines schedule structure thus requiring a layover as there was no shorter connection from Istanbul with Turkish Airlines on the same day. After having arrived at the hotel desk with people who just got of the flight I was told that the hotels were full and there was nothing he could do about it apart from offering me a voucher to compensate for the hotel for a bus trip around Istanbul at 7am - bearing in mind that its was 2am and I had no sleep. Long story short he claimed to be the supervisor and a colleague beside him the manager, he gave me a counter number for the Turkish Airlines customer service number to which I called and was told I met the requirements but they wouldn’t provide, forcing me to give up. I not only wasted $30 for the visa required to get through passport control but my time. They also use a trick to bypass the free transit hotel: If they are aware of long delays (more than 10 hours) they just break down 1 big delay into multiple short delays.

I arrived very early due to few connections to HKG from my departure town Danang by Vietnam with a LCC carrier, Jetstar. Thus I had to leave transit and pick luggage after immigration. However, I could not check in early in HKG so I had to take the Airport Express train and backtrack myself some 40 km downtown for city check in which is possible 8 hours prior to departure while in Airport only 4 hours are granted. The city check-in took 2 minutes when finally there, but to access the Kowloon station in question (for city check-in) took me >1 hour. By checking in there I got rid of my luggage and the BP issued granted me lounge access upon returning to HKG airport. I tried all three Star-alliance lounges and found Silverkris having the best food, drinks, and staff, while the Thai and United lounges had stunning panorama view towards the tarmac making up for modest food and drink supplies (and no champagne) and very few staff. Onboard the FAs are friendly and caring. However, all appear to be of only one (Turkish?) nationality. This is a pity as they obvious have received limited, internal training - which results in a less perfect flight experience as the FA’s, in general, have lower skills and possess limited, modest exposure. The wandering cook onboard is superfluous in my view and makes a clown out of himself. IFE good. Headphones were of superb quality (“Devon”). Chairs turned into spacious flat beds.

I take this flight twice a year and even though the food service deteriorated a bit lately, it is still very good compared to other airlines (unfortunately on my last flights there was no more amuse bouche, no more many options of starters to pick from the trolley and no more final trolley with coffee and petit fours-the latter was now consolidated with the dessert trolley, also the champagne on board was downgraded from Taittinger to Mumm). As I said the meals service is still good but it could be a lot better if flight attendants would be more proactive at offering drinks and refills. They just do not do it, you need to call them every time you need a refill (it does not happen in many other airlines) and when you do they take forever and it is obvious are not willing to do it.

As we arrived home we found out that one of the locks of our suitcases was damaged in a way that this lock could not be used any more.  No message of Customs was left. An inquiry at Samsonite showed that this part can not be repaired. So we are forced to buy a new suitcase because of this damage. Turkish Airlines is responsible to take care of our bagage and if some problem occurs, they should offer a solution. Challenge 1 is to find out how to claim damaged baggage. Found on the internet and made a claim the next day. Challenge 2 is to convince Turkish Airlines (Customer Care) about the real cause of the damage, since they decline a claim immediately. Challenge 3 is to convince them about the fact that the suitcase is not repairable. If it would be, we should send it to a national Samsonite repair center (costs!). But they confirmed that the lock is no longer available (only during the warranty time of 5 years). A copy of these emails were sent to TA, but the refuse to accept it and think about another solution. Challenge 4 is to convince TA that for me the only solution is that I have to buy a new suitcase, which I did, and to get a refund as compensation.
