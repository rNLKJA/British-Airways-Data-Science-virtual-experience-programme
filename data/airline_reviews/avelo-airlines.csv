"""where is the customer service?""2",2,2022-11-20,"We were to fly from Burbank on Thursday 11/17 to Idaho on Avelo Airlines, as we arrived at Burbank, we received a text saying that our flight has been canceled due to maintenance problems, so far, I have called, emailed and have not heard anything from this company. We tried to book another flight while we were at the airport but to no avail, so the 5 of us returned home and are trying to recoup other monies that we paid for such as parking at the airport, renting car and most of all ruined a family function that we had planned for months. Also vacation times were used and lost time for work has occurred and no vacation. I will never ever use this airline ever! where is the customer service, there is none, I hope that I get reimbursed, and I won't lose my $1000 that I paid for.

"""it is completely meaningless""",1,2022-11-11,"Not Verified |  On November 11, 2022 I had (2) reservations to fly from Sarasota, FL to New Haven, CT. Upon arrival at the airport, there was not a single soul at the Avelo Check-in station. The tickets were booked on November 9, 2022. I tried to get e-mailed boarding passes immediately upon purchase on 11/9/2022. Avelo's preferred method of check-in through their website was not available on Wednesday 11/9/2022, Thursday 11/10/2022 or Friday 11/11/2022. Again, there was not a soul in site when we arrived at the Sarasota, FL (SRQ) airport at the Avelo desk at all for any help. We had been trying to check-in for three days with absolutely no luck. After waiting at their ""customer lack of service desk"" for a significant amount of time, we ran to the security check-in to see if we could get through using our IDs. Needless to say that was a joke. I waited on hold for a total of 1 Hour and 52 Minutes to be told that helping us find a flight out of an airport 3 hours South of us could be arranged for $700.00 more may or may not be an option. The CSR (that refused to give her CSR number) was downright rude and unhelpful, if not downright disrespectful. We are now not going to make it to our family reunion and are totally heartbroken. I wholeheartedly give this airline and their representatives an absolute ZERO for my review and will never recommend that anyone consider booking with them because it is completely meaningless.

"""customer service is terrible""",3,2022-10-31,"Not Verified |  Avelo’s customer service is terrible. Hold times greater than an hour. Our plane had a technical issue, which can happen, but we were left in the dark relative to what was going on. Very poor communication. Our departure time was supposed to be 6:30 pm and we ended up leaving at 1:30 am. Apparently the needed plane repair parts were in New Haven so they flew a plane to Charleston with the parts and took us back to New Haven on the return flight. If that wasn’t the case I’m not sure what we would have done. The airport closed at 4:30 am. There was no guidance from Avelo.

I knew I was on a discount, regional airline, and I did all the things to stay at the base rate. I safely flew in one hour each way at a sale rate rate $50–total. That is less than tolls and gas to drive the 5 hours, and I consider this option to see my kids a total blessing.

"""I do not recommend this airline""",1,2022-10-27,I have a flight booked for this Friday. Went through Avelo website to book my flight .. my itinerary says I paid 97$ for my one way flight 40$ for my carry on bag and 27$ for my seat. Total on my itinerary was 186$ when I booked it. After about an hour I logged onto my bank statement. It showed Avelo airlines took out 236$. 50$ more than what I originally thought I paid. After being on hold for 52 minutes inquiring about this charge the woman I finally spoke with after 52 minutes of being on hold proceeds to tell me that they decided to change my itinerary and charge me 50$ more after I booked my initial flight and the only way I found out was by checking my bank statement. So even though I was not informed nor booked for the price I thought I was initially paying. She told me if I wanted to keep the flight that the 236$ was final.

"""Every time my flight pushed back by hours""",1,2022-10-13,"Every single time I have flown with this airline my flight has been pushed back by hours the week before. Sometimes multiple times the week before. And every single time it has been pushed back by hours once again two hours before the flight. It never fails, I always end up buying a ticket to have a day or at least half a day to spend with my family and lose that entire first day. Don’t save the money, spend more for a better airline. You will not get refunds for canceled tickets only travel points so if you buy a ticket and don’t like the drastic change you can’t fix it anyway. I kept trying this airline because it is a direct flight and saves two hours or so from connecting, might as well go with that anyway because the flight changes are so drastic you’ll lose more hours trying to fly direct than the “longer” flights anyway.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Eugene to Burbank,October 2022,1,2,,1,1,,False,
"""absolute worst customer service""",1,2022-09-29,"Not Verified | New Haven to Myrtle Beach. Avelo changed our flight, never notified us and I only found out because I couldn’t check into my flight. I called and waited almost 2 hours to connect to someone to be told our flight was moved to the day before and we weren’t sent an email - never got one. Checked every junk spam folder etc, nothing. So Avelo sends me a screen shot of the email confirmation with the departure and arrival date for that flight as the original date I had booked, not the one they changed it too! Over a month now and can barely talk to anyone - lost $1200 on an emergency flight home because Avelo couldn’t get us out for another 2 days I believe it was. Customer service has been a nightmare, hours on hold and just hanging up, giving up. Getting connected and transferred around and no one able to Help because it’s someone else’s issue who deals with it. Going on “hearing from a manager” for a week And a half Now, no reply to Email sent by me twice or call. Wrote again today, see what happens. The flight crew was an absolute gem, it’s too bad the rest ruined our time with Avelo. Maybe someone out there will Help me change our tune to Avelo, by out there I mean the airline actually trying to rectify the issue they created and are responsible for. I’ll even take that call from a manger I’ve been waiting a week and a half for. Update two weeks later the manager finally reached out and has been no help whatsoever claims there’s nothing wrong on their end and will not give me their information to help my email company. See if those emails ever came through their domain. The absolute worst customer service I have ever seen or dealt with. the worst part is there’s reviews online that same issue.

"""do not fly Avelo""",1,2022-08-05,"Not Verified |  Agree with other reviewer, worst experience ever flying. Flight was delayed for 4 hours … then cancelled last minute. Leaving us all stranded in Eugene. We were all told that another flight would not be available for another 2 days! Several other passengers had been canceled the 3 days previously … 3 times cancelled in a row!! 2 of these were young girls flying alone and were sobbing in the airport after hearing they were being cancelled for a 3rd time. No offer of help from the gate agent, he said he didn’t work for Avelo. Hundreds of additional $$$ spent on a hotel for that night (flight was cancelled at 8:00 pm) taxis and cost of 2 flights home the next day, we couldn't wait 2 days for a flight home as we have jobs, children, pets in boarding, and lives to get back to. Hours upon hours spent on the phone trying to reach “customer service” (what a joke!) to then be told by a surly agent that you have to email in a claim, not call it in. Have heard nothing in nearly 2 weeks after we went in our email claim, nothing. Called them again and asked for management, was told the manager’s name but he does not take phone calls. The moral of the story here is “you get what you pay for” do not fly Avelo.

"""you really aren’t saving much money""",1,2022-07-27,"Eugene to Burbank. This was without a doubt the worst airline experience I’ve ever had. Avelo cancelled our flight from Eugene, OR to Burbank, CA without any type of heads up. We found out when we got to the airport. They said the next flight out would be two days later, which was so frustrating because we all have lives and jobs to get to and not everyone can wait around an extra two days. We ended up spending an extra $500 for last minute tickets from Portland to Burbank via Southwest Airlines (which was a much better experience!!), not to mention the $100 it cost to get a shuttle from Eugene to Portland (2 hours away). I have yet to get a refund from Avelo for this flight, and customer service is impossible to reach. Needless to say, I will never fly with Avelo again and advise that travelers look elsewhere. Avelo also claims to have lower prices, but once all the fees and additional things are added, you really aren’t saving much money.",True,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Eugene to Burbank,July 2022,1,1,,1,1,,False,
