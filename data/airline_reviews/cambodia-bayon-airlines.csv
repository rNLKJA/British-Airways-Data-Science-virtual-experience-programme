"""aircraft noisy and vibrates""",3,2017-03-29,"âœ… Verified Review |  Short trip from Siem Reap to Phnom Penh on March 17. One way cost $50. The plane is a Chinese Built MA60 turboprop aircraft that currently does not have a certificate to fly in Europe, N America, etc. It's very noisy and vibrates (much more than an ATR). Weather was good so no problems, but not sure I would like to be on one in poor conditions. The week before I flew PHN-REP on Bassaka Air A320 for similar cost, which was much better.",False,MA60,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Siem Reap to Phnom Penh,March 2017,3,4,,3,4,,False
