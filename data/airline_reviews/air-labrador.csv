Air Labrador customer review,2,2013-11-14,Rigolet Labrador to Goose Bay Labrador on 13 October 2013 on an Air Labrador twin Otter. Aircraft has been well used over the years but provided a comfortable and quick way back to Goose Bay. Bush flying co-pilot loaded and unloaded the bags seating - well- wherever there is an empty seat. No complaints about the service and would not hesitate to fly with them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,4,,True
