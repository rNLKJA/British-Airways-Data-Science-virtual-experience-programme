I want to share my awful experiences that I had that day. Firstly the flight was so jam-packed that the waiting area was densely crowded and during these times where Covid is out there to kill everyone. The same thing continued when the boarding was announced. Everyone rushed to be the first to get on the plane and again the staff handling the boarding seemed so okay with it. People weren't asked to be in any queue or anything. And again the boarding was done in a rush. Secondly, since every middle seat in the flight was booked, a PPE kit which should have been provided wasn't given to anyone. This being said, we could clearly see the staff members in possession of those PPE kits but for some unknown reasons, they didn't provide those kits to anyone and moreover, didn't stop anyone who hadn't put on the PPE kit. It seemed like the airline is hell bent on ""lives cutting"" rather than ""cost cutting."" Thirdly, the service on board wasn't up to the mark. Usually every flight has the service where they at least provide you water to drink. But here we couldn't see anyone coming up to us with anything. When we asked for water, it took them ages to get back to us. Lastly, to my most surprise, something happened which I have never experienced before. Be it any airlines, the pilot makes an announcement much before the landing and gives a brief pitch about the time that's remaining for the touch down, weather/temperature of the destination and stuff like that. But here no announcement as such was done and the pilot just gave a one liner, ""we are about to land at the Maldives international airport. Hope you guys had a great experience."" Clearly we didn't have a great experience! And just when the plane landed, everyone again rushed to deboard the flight. The flight attendants didn't seem bothered by this. Be it Covid times or pre covid times, attendants always ask the people on board to maintain patience and decorum. Nothing as such happened. Ultimately, we managed to come out of the plane. And all we could think of was when we would get ourselves tested for Covid. We were so sure that we would have gotten infected because of this poorly managed flight service throughout. Luckily we were okay but it clearly was a terrible experience for me and my husband.

On multiple calls, I was always told that seat 3A is having extra leg room, in short row 3 is extra legroom. When requested to pre allot the seat, I was told that booking a seat in advance is a paid service. (I'm talking about reserving a seat and not booking the flight ticket) I paid the seat fees 1100 INR. Upon boarding the flight I was surprised to look at the seat as it was a very ordinary seat without much legroom. I double checked and it was 3A. I got worried thinking how am I going to adjust there with my infant. I sat there, I waited for all the passengers to board. Front two rows were empty so out of 12 seats only one passenger was seating, remaining 11 seats were vacant. Once the boarding was finished, I called the crew member told her that I have paid for the extra leg room seat and requested if they can change my seat and let me seat at one of those empty seat. The lady said it's not in her hand and sent someone else to me. I told the same story to another who came to me, He listened to me and said it's not in his hands the seats needs to be pre-booked, they are paid seats etc. and said he will get back to me.
