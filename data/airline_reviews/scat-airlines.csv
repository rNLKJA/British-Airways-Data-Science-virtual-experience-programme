"""a decent service""",8,2019-05-31,"Ust-Kamenogorsk to Karaganda. I recently took a group tour in Kazakhstan and this flight was part of the itinerary. The check-in counters at Ust-Kamenogorsk airport were kinda Soviet-style, but the process was efficient and we were soon in the rather featureless departure lounge (bring coins, there is a coffee vending machine for entertainment). Aircraft wasn't new but was well presented. It was completely full (apparently this flight doesn't run very often) but one flight attendant managed to serve a soft drink to everyone during the short flight. We had an airline pilot in our group, he had been wondering what to expect but in the end, thought the flight was fine. Luggage came quickly and nobody had any loss or damage. Overall, a decent service.",True,CRJ-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ust-Kamenogorsk to Karaganda ,May 2019,3,4,,4,4,,True
"""not sure it is worth it""",4,2018-01-13,"Almaty to Oskemen. I flew this airline before and it was ok, but this time my bad experience started with the check-in, where I was offered to either pay 5000 tenge to the check-in attendant or 7000 to the cashier. It could lead to a situation when I could be missing a bag, but on paper everything would be just fine. I was also told that supposedly my hand luggage wouldn’t fit, so I would have to check it in, while according to their website my bag is exactly what it should be. I had my laptop in it, and there was no way I was going to check it in. I called their Almaty office to complain, but they hung up on me in the middle of conversation. The aircraft that they gave us was sitting in the cold overnight and the ice that accumulated inside started thawing as it got warmer and a number of passengers had water dripping all over them. The flight attendants acted as if it were a normal occurrence. They are cheap, but I am not sure it is worth it.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Almaty to Oskemen,January 2018,2,1,,1,5,,False
"""inflight a nice sandwich""",8,2017-07-09,"✅ Verified Review |  Astana to Almaty. After A friendly check in with check in luggage allowance without any supplemental charge I proceeded to the gate. This aircraft was quite old, the interior a little worn but OK for the short flight. Sweets were offered before take off, then inflight a nice sandwich with non-alcoholic beverages, and finally tea and coffee. Before landing again sweets. The crew handled the service professionally but in a non smiling manner. For the price paid this airline offers good value for money and to a level that low cost carriers in Europe do not reach.",False,Boeing 737-500,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Astana to Almaty,June 2017,3,4,,4,5,,True
"""I am glad I flew with them""",8,2016-05-03,"SCAT has a very poor reputation but I had no problems with them. Check in was performed by a handling agent in Almaty and as usual with any airline there it was perfunctory but efficient. I had selected my seats previously online with no issues. The flight started to board a little late alongside an Air Astana flight departing 5 minutes later to Astana, resulting in many passengers going to the wrong gate and being turned back there. This is more an airport issue than an airline one though. The flight pushed back around 5 minutes behind schedule. The aircraft, although rather old, felt comfortable and the crew were very efficient. They managed to serve candies before take off, a boxed meal and a drink followed by tea and coffee and more candies before landing all for a 1 hour 20 minute flight. Baggage was included in the ticket price and the onboard service was friendly. The price was less than many European low cost carriers would charge for their most basic service. Their low safety ranking nearly put me off but according to their website they are working on getting accreditation so this reassured me and I am glad I flew with them.",False,Boeing 737-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,ALA to TSE,April 2016,4,5,,3,5,,True
