"""crew attentive and polite""",9,2018-04-23,"Tokyo Narita to Sapporo. I found Jetstar Japan to be a good option for Japan domestic travel. As a low-cost/budget airline there is a fee structure in place for most items beyond the initial fare paid, depending on the package purchased - baggage (checked and carry on), seat assignments, beverages and food, etc. There are also strict weight limits in place for baggage, again both checked and carry on, but in-line with other airlines of this type. (In the Japanese domestic market think Peach and Vanilla.) If you can accept the carrier is not full-service, like ANA and JAL, and is a budget option, right down to the terminal facilities at certain airports, then the trade-off in fare paid will be acceptable to you. On this trip I found a short line for baggage drop at Terminal 3 at Narita Airport, agents who spoke fluent English, which was appreciated, and proficiency in performing their duties. The walk from the check in area to the gate was long, probably 1,200 meters, so be prepared for that if you have mobility issues. This is a budget experience and Terminal 3 at Narita reflects this. Once you pass security there are virtually no airport amenities though there were free charging stations, which were appreciated. At the gate our flight was boarded quickly, professionally, and on-time. Staff announcements were in Japanese and English. One thing I noticed on another Jetstar Japan flight at the next gate, the staff gave a warning that, due to volcanic ash, their flight may divert to another airport. After over 2-million miles flown I've never seen that done before and felt it was a courteous gesture. Back to my flight, once on-board the aircraft was clean and the crew friendly. Again, all spoke English, including the pilots, beyond that required for air traffic control functions, and two of the four flight attendants spoke it fluently. We departed 4 minutes early. The only negative aspect of my flight comes on board and that was the seat. It was uncomfortable, the reason being it had almost no lower-back support whatsoever. Even the legroom was fine, but the seat comfort just wasn't there. This is an area where Peach has Jetstar Japan beat. Other aspects of the flight were fine - safety protocols were carried out diligently and the crew were attentive and polite. Once on the ground at Sapporo the taxi-in was short, with our flight arriving 1 minute past scheduled arrival, deplaning was fast, and baggage was delivered quickly, within 10 minutes of arrival. Overall I found Jetstar Japan to be a good option and I would travel with them again. There was good value, as compared to the full-service airlines or the train, and that was my main reason for flying them. If you can accept this is a budget experience, and the price reflects such, you will be happy. In regards to safety and in-flight crew attentiveness, there was little difference from a full service airline. If, however, you desire better airport amenities, more personalized service, better operational integrity; for example, the ability to recover after a cancellation or irregular operation, you may find a full service carrier more appealing, but at a price. In the end, it's a value proposition, and if saving money is your goal, Jetstar Japan is a fine way to go. If you're curious about the distinction between Jetstar Japan and Peach/Vanilla, soon to be merged into one carrier, Peach, I find each to be acceptable with both having a very similar product offering.",True,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo Narita to Sapporo,April 2018,3,5,,5,5,,True,
