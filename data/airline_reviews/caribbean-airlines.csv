I used the opportunity to upgrade my ticket to Business Class which the agent did over the phone, simple transaction. I use the APP for all my Flight Management with regard to seats, meal requests etc.. BW600/26JUN POS/YYZ operated on-time. It was my first time using the new B737 MAX8 and was really impressed with the comfort of the cabin. The ergonomics of the seat made for a super comfortable 6hr flight. The IFE is a big improvement on this aircraft and the aesthetic of the cabin is also very mod looking. Once of the highlights of this flight was the ability to pre-order a meal. In this case, it was the Stewed Chicken with Macaroni Pie, Callaloo, Fried Plantain. A full on Sunday lunch on a Thursday night, LOL. Food was a generous amount and very tasty. Upon arrival in YYZ, I was expecting delays exiting the aircraft and getting thru Immigration and Customs. News of lengthy delays preceded my trip, but, it was actually very easy. BW607/09JUN YYZ/POS via GEO. Another on-time departure, early in fact. I opted for this flight via GEO because I preferred a daytime flight vs the red-eye which operates non-stop YYZ/POS, no regrets. Had a nice late breakfast in the lounge at Pearson and then a another delicious pre-ordered meal as we took off towards Guyana. This time, I ordered the Curry Chicken (or Chicken Curry) with Dhal and Rice. It was also a very generous amount and very tasty. Great flight down into the Southern Caribbean. The crew: On both flights, my cabin crew were amazing. They really do stand out from crews on other airlines in my opinion. They are warm and compassionate and their service is graceful. Extremely professional. Overall, my trip with Caribbean Airlines exceeded expectations and look forward to flying with them again soon.

Service onboard was friendly and efficient. There were PTVs but I spent most of the flight reading. The food was great much nicer than BA. The captain kept us updated throughout. Overall I enjoyed it and particularly appreciated that it was a proper non stop flight. Having been a regular user of the old BW Tristar service from LHR this felt like like a return to form for CAL. Hope they keep it up.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,3,,True,
Caribbean Airlines customer review,1,2013-12-20,We left Barbados at 7.15am this morning 18/12/2013 flight 30 mins late no explanation. Arrived in Trinidad. Awful service on the ground after the cancellation at the very last minute of our flight BW 526 from Trinidad to Guyana. No apologies just that the plane had mechanical problems which had just been discovered even though the plane had come in yesterday. Told that we were going to be taken by bus to a hotel in Port of Spain and that if we were lucky nothing certain we would have a flight at 10 pm this flight is now showing as departure 12.35am. We refused the transport offer and after a long argument have been very ungraciously put on a flight at 8.35pm. A flight was showing as departing at 4.35 but we were told that we could not get on it as it was a fuel stop even though it has been showing on the departure board since our arrival at 8.15 this morning. We watched passengers get off crew change and still we were refused seats. No exception could be made even in circumstances caused by the airline. This is a two and a half day trip for us and CA through their own incompetence and complete lack of customer service have taken half and made it an unpleasant trying and tedious experience. There was no consistency in the story being told and most of all no apologies. Fingers crossed that our flight BW483 will be maintained at 8.35 this evening 18/12/2013.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,2,,,1,,False,
Caribbean Airlines customer review,8,2013-10-15,Travelled Port of Spain to New York JFK on 1st October 2013 Economy class and returned on 7th October 2013 on Business Class. I have travelled with them before but they seem to have improved. Flights were on time both ways. Food and drinks were complementary and was reasonable for the class each time for this 5 hour flight. On the outbound which was economy class it was a sandwich and a pack of biscuits and on the way back which was a breakfast service it was blueberry pancakes and turkey sausages (which was my selection from a menu from three choices). FAs were courteous and helpful in both classes of service.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,4,,,4,,True,
Caribbean Airlines customer review,,2013-08-05,Business class July 8th from JFK to Port of Spain. The seats were dirty with crumbs all over.

Caribbean Airlines customer review,5,2013-07-24,18th June 2013 BW902 POS-LGW. 1st July 2013 BW903 LGW-POS. Check in at POS was fast. Flight was scheduled to depart 7.40pm but boarding began at 7.30pm. Departed 45 minutes late. Once airborne food was nice and multiple drink runs. Personal screens for InFlight Entertainment were not working. Nice 767 with comfy seats. However the return was a nightmare. Scheduled to depart London at 12.50pm on 30th June BW 903. Got to the airport on the 30th June at 10am to be told by another passenger that the flight was cancelled. A long line with frustrated passengers for 2 hours as no information from Caribbean Airlines. After 3 hours I was told that it was due to the A/C not working and they will be putting us up in a hotel overnight and was booked for a 4.50am departure the next day (1st July). At the hotel told that the flight was delayed until 9.50am and to head back to the check in counter at 7am. Finally got to the gate and we boarded on time. Did not leave on time left 3 hours later. Flight attendants were less than helpful and sour. Flight was wonderful with fair IFE and a hot meal and 3 drink runs. Afternoon tea as well.

Caribbean Airlines customer review,8,2013-06-03,"LGW-POS 2 June 2013 BW903 Economy B767. Check in at LGW North Terminal was effortless having checked-in online. Had the added benefit of ""Priority Access"" as a ""Club Caribbean"" member as well as an invitation to the ""No.1 Lounge"". Lounge situated at the far end of the Duty Free shops and relatively near to the CAL gate. Lounge greeting pleasant and the facility seems adequate. There will be no announcements which we were told at check in and so you need to be aware of the time. Crew were warm and welcoming as you entered the aircraft. Seating configuration is 2-3-2 and I would suggest any aisle seat in the middle 3 section. 2 toilets between row 15 and 19 and also at the rear of the aircraft. Crew were warm and friendly. Within the first 2 hours a hot lunch was served followed by a beverage service and a coffee and tea service. Later in the flight they passed around with some bottles of water and 2 hours prior to landing tea was served. Evident that IFE is from an older framework and the films play on a loop. TV's at every seat with a remote control. Heard many passengers complaining in both in both directions that TVs did not work at their seat. There is power at the seat near the floor and I was able to watch my own media. Flight left on time was smooth and arrived on time. Overall pleasant experience.

Caribbean Airlines customer review,6,2013-04-02,Business/First from JFK-POS POS POS-GEO-JFK. Their lounges are basic. Flight left on time. Their 737-800 business class is pretty standard. Leg room in Business is just alright but considering the size of the plane acceptable. Food and service was good as usual FA's are personable and professional. It has always been my experience that CA tends to run out of popular dishes very quickly kind of sad when business class is not that big. Return flight on their brand new 767-300er departed 90 minutes late the reason why is still a mystery to me. On board nice roomy plane no complaints on leg room here. The seats were nice enough they did lay flat however they did seem to go for very basic business class e.g. inflight entertainment was there but not usable and power at seat didn't work. I ran into a really big issue with my seat tray - during food service it completely fell apart and separated from the swing arm and could not be reattached. It was a very full flight but fortunately there was one empty seat the FA's quickly made accommodations for me. Overall I would say it was sufficient.,False,,,First Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,True,

Caribbean Airlines customer review,1,2013-03-08,Flight from Montego Bay to Fort Lauderdale was pretty routine. Flight attendants were pleasant and helpful. Unfortunately the same couldn't be said about our return trip. Check-in staff were barely civil and one woman in particular gives new meaning to the word 'rude'. Their fees for overweight and/or extra bag is outrageous. Onboard the cabin staff were friendly and helpful but we couldn't get extra creamer for our hot beverages. The attendant came with evaporated milk and proceeded to add it to my friend's coffee resulting in her having to get another one and another package of creamer and sugar. The little TV was loud and there was no way to block it out. The only blessing here is that the flight is short so escape wasn't too long in coming.

Caribbean Airlines customer review,,2013-02-21,Round trip from JFK-KIN on 02/10/13 - 2/18/13. Customer service in New York was very poor on boarding. Flight Co-ordinator was rude - instead of explaining to passengers that the flight was fully booked and all the carry-on luggage would not fit they were just taking people's bags and giving reasons that did not make sense. Coming from Jamaica you were normally allowed to take a box of rum with your carry-on on the plane I was stopped and told that was considered 2 pieces of luggage. My suitcase was taken tagged and put under the plane. I will never travel this airline again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,1,,False,
Caribbean Airlines customer review,10,2013-01-22,Port of Spain to London Gatwick. Customer service onboard and the warm hospitality of the flight attendants make this superior service.

Return flight was the same.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Caribbean Airlines customer review,9,2012-07-15,POS-TAB. Very quick shuttle flight between Trinidad and Tobago. Check in immediate in POS and passed through into separate 'domestic' departure area for the shuttle. Went through to find absolutely nothing other than seats so were allowed back through to get drinks etc. Boarded on time polite and professional crew. Brand new turboprop with comfy leather seats and very generous legroom. Such a short hop so no drinks etc. Bags for the 20 or so passengers did seems to take an age to come from the aircraft but other than that excellent and cheap.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Caribbean Airlines customer review,2,2012-03-01,POS-MIA MCO-KIN-POS. Online check-in for POS-MIA segment. Agents at counter in POS were average but check-in fast. Onboard snack was okay only one pass for the drink service. Flight was a bit late and lines at passport control in MIA were long. On my return from Orlando even though we had pre-booked seats we were told we would be sitting apart and we would have had to pay for seats together. A/C on the aircraft was not working. No meal service on this segment just a drink and a biscuit. KIN-POS leg had the same problems no A/C and engine problems. Mediocre service on this leg. Arrival into POS was 40 mins behind schedule. Overall the service was below what I am accustomed to at AA however if your expectations are very low then this can be your choice of airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,

No inflight entertainment but not a problem.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Caribbean Airlines customer review,,2011-07-22,It was the Holiday week and tickets were very expensive. Not to mention the impending snow storm. We arrived at the airport 6am to find out flights were delayed for 2 hrs. At 8am flights were still delayed as well as dealing with long lines. Caribbean airlines were making no announcements as to where we should head. I was travelling with my 6 month old son and husband. Needless to say everyone was frustrated. After waiting until 1pm to get on the flight we were then kicked off because the flight was over booked. Very disorganized. We were then let on the same flight because of no shows. We arrived into Trinidad at 4pm with no formula for the baby as well as no luggage.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Caribbean Airlines customer review,8,2011-03-15,Port of Spain - New York return. Check-in at POS nice. Flight was on time and B737 was clean however a bit cramped. Friendly crew.

Nice movie and friendly crew in a clean but cramped plane.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Caribbean Airlines customer review,6,2011-03-07,POS-TAB-POS disappointed with the service aircraft is ok but crew seem to be on a rush and wanting to get out of the plane as soon as possible.

Caribbean Airlines customer review,6,2010-11-27,Economy class JFK-GEO return. Outbound on the overnight flight the service was quite warm yet basic compared to airlines such as United or BA - the B737-800 quite cramped for a six hour flight meal service poor drink service quite generous. The 90 minute layover at Port of Spain was quite off putting. Return flight was annoying as the stopover in Port of Spain was changed to a change of air craft. All in all for a six hour flight inflight entertainment extremely dated to a shared screen no choice of film meals poor and constant Caribbean Airlines footage of routes etc a larger wide bodied aircraft would be better on this route. I'd use this airline as a last resort and would seek an alternative.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Caribbean Airlines customer review,7,2010-10-25,Toronto to Trinidad return. Inflight food is provided free and of excellent quality. Flights on-time.

Caribbean Airlines customer review,3,2010-02-27,JFK-POS-GEO return. Cabin was okay staff unfriendly and no entertainment.

Caribbean Airlines customer review,5,2010-01-10,Port-Of-Spain - Miami return. Service at Piarco atrocious and sloppy. In the early morning people should be vibrant and happy not sloppy and rude which was the case. Flight attendants nice and hot meals on both legs. IFE started with Caribbean essence with no audio then all screens went blank for the rest of the trip. No one even bothered to explain the technical difficulty. On return meal was mashed potatoes and BBQ chicken - with the amount of gravy in the meal it turned out to be a soup. IFE audio and video were not working properly so it was difficult to understand the movie. Again no explanation to even apologize for the inconvenience. Clean planes with comfortable seating. I am only using this airline because American Airlines is no better!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Caribbean Airlines customer review,4,2009-04-29,Travelled to Fort Lauderdale from Port of Spain. A full flight but wonderful crew.

The return check in was very quick. In-flight service on both short flights was very professional and warm. No complaints,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Caribbean Airlines customer review,4,2009-04-06,YYZ-POS. Check in was smooth. Wish I had done web check in because the line up was rather long as it was a full flight. The aircraft was operated by Transavia but with full Caribbean Airlines service. We left the gate on time but due to the weather the aircraft needed to be de iced. Dinner was very tasty and service was very warm and professional. We managed to arrive early into Port of Spain to cap off a very enjoyable flight.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Caribbean Airlines customer review,4,2009-03-17,Port-of-Spain to Bridgetown. Peleasant experience. After a terrible experience with LIAT this airline was a breath of fresh air. Modern aircraft with reasonably comfortable seating and efficient procedures all round.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Caribbean Airlines customer review,3,2009-02-13,BGI to KIN. Flight had started in POS and arrived in BGI 10 mins late. There was some confusion as to seat assignments on boarding as people from POS had moved. But the two very pleasant crew members at the rear of the cabin that met us at the door were on hand to make sure everyone was in the seats that had been assigned. Because of the routing of the aircraft you do get the feel that it is a glorified bus service with nothing being served between BGI and SXM. However although the crew passed through with no service as such they were happy to get you canned drinks tea coffee and other such items. We landed in SXM (stunning views and landing) and had about 50 mins on the ground to pick up passengers before we continued on to KIN. We took off on the 2 hour 15 min flight and a full meal service was conducted with a choice of 2 entrees. Alcohol is available for a charge of $5 but all other drinks are free. The only down side is the very frustrating drop down screens that play the company promo video over the loud speaker. You really cant get away from it unless you have your head sets ready to play some music to drown it out. But be aware they only let you check in one item of baggage for the hold. even if you have a really big bag they let you take it in the cabin as there is as charge of around $25 US to check in a second bag.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Caribbean Airlines customer review,4,2008-10-15,My wife and I have just returned from our trip POS-MIA-POS It was a most enjoyable and pleasant one. The flight attendants were courteous and caring. They went the extra mile to make everyone comfortable. Thank you for making us want to travel again with Caribbean Airlines.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
