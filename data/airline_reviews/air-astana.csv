Food was delicious, well prepared and of high quality. Next flight from Astana to Almaty, they offered a good lounge in Astana, with some basic snacks. They had a special boarding line for business, boarding was very efficient and fast. 767 cabin is really beautiful, well appointed and comfortable even for longer flights.

Staff accommodating and professional. The meal was delicious with metal cutlery. Wine and beer were complimentary (no spirits on the menu, though), and extras were served with no frowns. IFE was one of the best I experienced, no lag whatsoever. One weird thing was that the screen by design could not be adjusted when the seat in front was reclined, so the viewing angles could be uncomfortable. We were given outstanding amenity kits with neck air pillow, slippers, pen, some hand cream, eye shades and ear plugs. Different coloured kits seemed to have slightly different content, so make sure to collect them all. The crew passed the cabin with drinks several times after the meal service. Seat comfort was okay, nothing outstanding. Almaty to Delhi was on an older A321, with no personal screens. The seats were very comfortable with great seat pitch and traditional ""thick"" profile of the seats. Cabin crew were lovely and the meal was even better. There were some amenity kits given as well, except a bit smaller ones (which makes sense on a 3 hour daytime flight). You could access their entertainment via your own device and onboard wi-fi for free with no issues, and the selection was impressive, but the lack of power ports meant you will run out of power quite soon. Delhi to Almaty was practically the same as the flight from Almaty to Delhi. For Almaty - Moscow I have made a bet to upgrade on their website (the lowest amount possible), and we were upgraded to business.

The cabin crew were very accommodating, greeting us with champagne as a pre-departure drink, and the purser greeted us by name, making sure we had a fantastic flight. Meals were delicious, each course was brought separately. If I could think of any improvement in business class, it would be alcohol menu, because there were just one type of champagne, one type of white and red wine (plus lots of spirits and cocktails). I believe the wine card can and should be improved. Their Bloody Mary was perfect, by the way. Almaty airport is an absolute disaster - it's small, crowded, with nowhere to sit or relax, no decent cafes, everyone is shouting at everyone.

Not quite up to the standard of the top Airlines but worth their 4 star Skytrax status. Outbound the meal was one of the best I've experienced in the air; with multiple courses presented separately and the food options varied and delicious. Inbound was another matter however with tasteless cold fish chicken that was a bit dry and less attractive options. Maybe the Caterer in Astana isn't as good as in London. Service both ways however was excellent with pre take-off drinks offered boiled sweets hot face towels drinks and nuts or canapés and very attentive staff. The seats were pretty comfy and whilst not fully flat (hopefully their Dreamliners on order will have fully flat seats in Business) they still had very decent recline and allowed for some sleep. (we were on a 757 for all sectors so if you get this aircraft type or a 767 on Domestic sectors then you're doing pretty well in Business Class for such a short flight - nothing like the terrible Business Class European Airlines offer on short haul flights). The Etihad Lounge at Heathrow was excellent; and it's very quiet at the time that Air Astana fly as there are no Etihad flights at this time however the Lounge in the Domestic Terminal at Almaty is really an embarrassment (small pokey room no natural light small snack counter charging for everything right down to a cup of tea!). Air Astana hand out tablets in Business Class as there are no seat back TV's. We found that we could hardly hear through the headphones on the way out but this was much better on the way back. The Moving Map however wasn't working on the way back and since the tablets aren't connected to the flight systems at all we had no idea where we were or how long until arrival for the whole flight. (even Economy Class presumably can access this info). Other minor irritations were the same 2 songs played continuously on loop when the aircraft is on the ground and the lovely new anti jet lag ceiling lighting system being inexplicably put through it's paces for the first few hours of the flight jumping between colours every few seconds. Terminal 4 at Heathrow was relatively quiet at the times Air Astana flew which made for a pleasant experience; and I can recommend Terminal 4 Long Stay Parking which is actually just across the main road from the Terminal - no more than 5 minutes in the shuttle bus!

Air Astana customer review,9,2014-10-08,Moscow - Astana - Almaty - Bangkok. Two of the three sectors were very late at night or early morning and I chose sleep rather than food.

Cabin crew were good and friendly (all seemed to speak good English) and I was allowed to take some items from the dinner menu prior to landing in Bangkok. The Astana - Almaty meal was good and the quantities perfectly adequate. Check in for all flights was quick and easy. I was disappointed that there is no business lounge in Astana for domestic passengers and the lounge in Almaty is one of the worst I have been in for International Business Class. Luggage was relatively quick off the plane especially in Bangkok. The seating was reasonably comfortable and there was adequate leg room on the flights from Moscow to Almaty. From Almaty to Bangkok it is an angled bed which is reasonably comfortable. IFE is very limited but not so important when you only want to sleep on the flight. I had my own entertainment for the Astana Almaty sector. I continue to fly Air Astana because I think that they are probably the best airline in Eurasia and not bad at keeping to their schedules.

Air Astana customer review,10,2014-02-04,I was lucky enough to be on one of Air Astana's new Boeing 767s returning from Bangkok to Almaty on the 12th January 2014. My business class seat was worth paying the extra over economy with the full lay flat seat and lots of room to spread out with a wide side table. Over the time I've been flying Air Astana I have seen them polishing their cabin service and the professionalism and presentation of the staff is of a high standard. Beverage service was very good although the food let the otherwise excellent travel experience down a little the meal was below par for business class.

Catering was served in the middle of the flight. Passengers who were sleeping were not offered their meals and amenity kits. Arrived early. Almaty-Astana-Moscow on A320. Food is tasty. Good choice of drinks including alcohol. Entertainment is outdated - just magazines music and a movie. Both flights on time. Smooth landings. We checked our baggage straight from Beijing to Moscow. It was a bit risky with 2 stop-overs but the airline staff assisted us in Kazakhstan and checked if the bags followed us.

No notification from Astana staff until three hours later. I didn't have visa for Kazakhstan so forced to stay in airport transit lounge overnight. Next day tried to get visa at airport so I could drive to Bishkek. Air Astana people completely unhelpful - said it was impossible. Said I could either stay in airport another night until the next flight or fly to Bishkek via Moscow. Persisted and argued.

There are a lot of modern new air planes that are being added continuously to Air Astana. The service is much more pleasant and more active inside the plane because the crew are very young comparing to KLM British Airways Lufthansa. The food is comparatively much better than other international airlines. In some planes they have some seats that are very unusual but comfortable you can sleep on them very easy and comfortable.

The aircraft was reassuringly up to date and instead of built in entertainment system had iPad movies/TV at least in Business Class which anyway give a much better picture (and the choice of music is excellent too!).

Air Astana customer review,9,2013-09-01,Bangkok - Astana Astana - Almaty Almaty - Istanbul. I have been flying Air Astana regularly for nearly 10 years. I think that they are the best airline in the Russian speaking world. My flights left and landed almost on time although we sat in the plane for an extended period of time in Ho Chi Min city and were not allowed off it. The food was good included the shortish flights between Almaty and Astana. The entertainment on the two long haul sectors was a bit limited.

Air Astana customer review,7,2013-06-02,Frankfurt-Astana June 1 2013. Economy class. Full house. A bit of a mess at the gate at Frankfurt due to the airline's boarding policy last rows board first. Most people did not know or did not understand this so they waited for their turn as close to the gate agent as possible and as a consequence there was some pushing. Left with a delay of 10 minutes. Very hard working and helpful crew they spoke good English and were always around offering something. Economy passengers received a comfort kit somehow basic but still a nice touch. Inflight entertainment is pre-historic small flat screens hanging from the roof every few metres showing just one film and a couple of cartoons. Drink service several choices including alcohol. Meal service with two options fish or chicken. Nice cheesecake for dessert. Finally after the trays had been collected crew served vanilla ice cream. Although the flight took almost 6 hours with an arrival time of 6 am no breakfast was served. Coffee or tea would have been appreciated especially given the 2 hour immigration queue at Astana upon landing. Overall a more than acceptable experience.

The spacing between the rows of seats was very large the seats reclined quite far back. Even though there were no indivdual tv screens for each seat we were each given ipads preloaded with movies which was a brilliant idea.

A relaxing journey which went quickly due to the level of comfort and service. On the return journey I was in the economy seat I had originally purchased. I slept almost all the way and with my seat fully reclined I was able to stretch my legs out fully.

Air Astana customer review,9,2013-02-14,Return flight from KL to ALA was in complete contrast to the previous flight down. On time crew very friendly and professional. Food and service was very good. After the debacle of the previous flight the agent in KL met me at the gate to again apologise. He had been very helpful previously. I also received an e-mail from the company's senior operations manager who went to lengths to apologise and explain. I do feel this is more than most airlines would do to follow up. This does give confidence that the airline is focussed on continuous improvement. The entertainment unit also had more movies loaded and this kept me fully occupied and well entertained for the flight.

Air Astana customer review,,2013-01-23,"Long delay in departing Almaty bound for KL. Perfect weather although no real excuse given. On boarding more than 2 hours late and by bus from the terminal to the aircraft which caused more delay we sat on the ground for a further 30 mins while a drunken passenger was off-loaded. At least half the flights I have taken with Air Astana have been delayed by hours not just minutes. On-board I asked the cabin crew to see if the connecting flight would be held or if other arrangements needed to be made. Their reply was that 'we will call ground staff and let you know'. The second time was 'we will talk to the captain' the third time was the same answer. On my fourth request I was then told that we have other passengers who are all going to be late. I was travelling on an Air Astana ticket and there was no concern or accountability shown toward this situation. T Arriving in KL with just 10 minutes to spare for the connection on Malaysia Airlines of course we could not board. 767 used on this route is very old although has had some face-lifts. Seats are narrow for business class seats and they are not lay flat they are ""lay on an angle and keep sliding down"" seats. The entertainment system is an IPAD style of portable unit. This only had a choice of three last release movies and at the end of the day there is nowhere to put it where you might consider ergonomically sensible to watch it.

Minimal waiting times and the staff were very professional. Board process was ok. Slightly let down by the fact that we were bussed to aircraft and made to board via steps in the rain. Both flights were on well kept clean A320s. Flights were relatively empty so I had 3 seats to myself. Cabin Crew were pleasant and professional.

Crew were friendly and breakfast was very nice. Departure formalities from Almaty are confusing and bizarre with no priority for business class at any stage apart from check in. No Air Astana staff to guide you through the complexities rather there are hawkers trying to make some cash who are more of a hindrance. Lounge is horrid not even 2* let alone 4*.

She raised her voice was very aggressive didn't ask me but said firmly that I must change my seat.

Air Astana customer review,9,2012-05-30,KUL-ALA-AKX return. First flight from KUL-ALA on their 767-300 flight was on time and service was great. But for a 7 hour flight it was quite hot in the cabin. Had some trouble with my visa-on-arrival in Almaty but the ground crew were very helpful translating throughout the immigration process: they even carried my bags and checked them in for my connecting flight while I was waiting for my visa. Flights from ALA-AKX and return were good got on their new Embraer and the service onboard was excellent though the crew does need improvements their English. Overall it was a great experience and would like to fly them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,9,2012-05-07,Bangkok to Almaty. Excellent flight friendly and helpful flight attendants. Cabin crews English is getting better and more than adequate for a foreigner travelling with them. Food was good but could have been a little better. Seats good - not quite a bed but allow you to stretch and sleep. Portable hand held entertainment units not so good compared with other airlines. I upgraded at airport and this represents excellent value. Pre-booked business class is not good value.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,9,2012-04-24,ALA-AYT-ALA. Very polite and professional staff onboard. Excellent serving of special meals as ordered at booking and excellent care for children and aged passengers. I would recommend providing more toiletries (hand lotion combs etc). If possible please consider other supplier of noise-reducing earplugs those available in the passenger's pouch now don't reduce the noise and pressure discomfort in the cabin.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,9,2012-04-04,Excellent recent flights great selection from inflight service. Very friendly attentive and polite staff. Flights were on time and very comfortable good connections modern aircraft and all in all a great flying experience.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,9,2012-03-29,Four flights IST-ALA-TSE-ALA-KUL. All 4 were on time excellent service by cabin crew very good food and drink selection - both on domestic and international legs. Good seat comfort (cradle seats on shorter sectors angled lie flat on B767 to KUL). The only disappointment was the lounge in ALA which is basically a bar and you get a voucher for a soft drink plus a snack.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,9,2012-02-25,Business class to Beijing return from Almaty. Service was good and staff friendly. Better food better wines even cold champagne now. Staff are the airlines asset. They are informative polite and helpful.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,2,2011-12-12,Amsterdam to Atyrau return. Using Air Astana many times (not just this route) I have found the flights to be very expensive and often delayed due to technical issues or weather plus chaotic check-in staff! However the flight itself is well above average in food flight entertainment and service. Taking into account the experience from arriving at the airports plus the cost of the flight one would expect a smooth journey per se. Unfortunately this is not the case! Being a state airline and promoted as such there is a lot of room for improvement in this area.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Air Astana customer review,6,2011-10-02,Almaty-Astana return and Almaty-Abu Dhabi and all flights were fine. Check-in cabin service average food basic no delays. The Abu Dhabi flight was in an A320 though so entertainment and facilities were limited. It's like a lesser western airline but they do seem well-organised and have a good website. The only problem I had was caused by Etihad. I booked a codeshare through the Etihad website as it was the same price but included a bus to Dubai. However the bus departure time on my ticket did not exist and had never existed. I had to wait 3 hrs for a bus. If they had provided accurate information I would have made alternate arrangements.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,10,2011-09-10,Almaty to London. The service was pleasant and efficient KCTV was handed out as soon as seat belt signs went out so the time waiting for drinks to be served passed quickly by. As for the new wine selection this is good now that imported wines are included. The change from my first flight (Nov 2007) to now is positive.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,7,2011-09-05,GUW-TSE-SVO. I flew for business in Economy class and was impressed how professional the service was. The food is ok there was IFE via a small flip-down video screen and headsets were handed out to all passengers in time. During the flight from TSE to SVO they issued a travel pack (flight socks blindfold comb). I did have a complaint with the customer service from one member of the cabin crew and requested a comment form which was handled professionally by other members of the crew.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Air Astana customer review,8,2011-07-27,Bangkok-Almaty (Business) Almaty-Astana-Novosibirsk. The Business Class was very good and liked the beds. There was plenty of space but would prefer truly flat beds. Friendly check-in in Bangkok and food was better than expected. Allowed to stay in the Business lounge while I waited for the connecting flight to Astana. Business lounge in Bangkok was very ordinary and toilets were in a different area. Almaty-Astana-Novosibirsk. Everything was adequate and better food than I expected. These flights were still full.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,9,2011-07-20,London-Almaty. The best direct flight between London and Almaty. Service is very good cabin crew are all well presented and professional. My only criticism is that I found the selection of wines quite limited. Everything else was as you would expect from a leading international airline boarding inflight entertainment landing etc. I have been a customer of Air Astana for the last 10yrs and can say that services planes and routes have all improved.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,9,2011-07-13,Friday night back to Almaty they did brilliantly. Excellent selection of drinks served by staff who knew how to mix them well prepared fresh food friendly and professional cabin staff newish plane comfortable seats  good music selection (I even have to admit I found the crass candid-camera-esk overhead TV amusing too then off the aeroplane and out of the airport and into a taxi in 5 mins max.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,9,2011-07-13,London-Almaty and this airline seems to get better and better. It was streamlined and helpful from check-in to arrival. The staff were unfailingly polite and helpful and did everything possible to make my journey pleasant. It took me a short while to work the seats but I slept very soundly when I had. There is plenty of space and it was an extremely comfortable way to get to Kazakhstan.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,,2011-07-08,"3 flights over 2 weeks (Almaty-Astana Astana-Almaty Almaty-Delhi). Computers at check in down no assigned seating every man for himself. Quite tall had reserved exit row was told to ""stand at the gate"" to be the first one on to grab the seat. However they boarded 20 people into coach ahead of us and the exit rows ended up being filled by families with kids. Changed ticket received confirmation via email arrive at airport to be informed ""Yes we sent a confirmation but you needed to come to our office to get the ticket."" Upon informing them that they sent the e-mail at 10 pm and the office would be closed they informed me I should have driven from central Astana to the airport to do it. Entire day wasted in Astana airport eventually placed on a late afternoon totally packed flight. Guaranteed exit row instead given tiny seat with zero leg room. Food absolutely dreadful. Staff spent most of their time sitting in the entirely empty Business Class section watching movies and telling passengers on the full flight not to use the Business Class bathroom.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Air Astana customer review,9,2011-05-18,Atyrau to Almaty - friendly service with right amount of attention 3 meal choices excellent legroom great selection of music. Most comfortable.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,

Air Astana customer review,2,2011-04-19,Amsterdam to Atyrau return – one of the most expensive flights per mile of any routes worldwide by any operator so you might think the flight would be special. Old aircraft substandard in-flight entertainment (the overhead TV monitor in my section not working and others with poor picture from what I could see) cramped full flight 2 of the 3 meal choices not available by the time the meal cart got to me all the wine with the meals gone by half way down the cabin bar service once per flight and grudgingly given using cheap local (to Kazakhstan) versions of spirits mixers and wines by unsmiling cabin crew.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Air Astana customer review,8,2010-11-27,Moscow to Almaty. This was a good flight it departed and arrived as schedules and the luggage was offloaded efficiently at Almaty. There was a slight hiccup with the check-in and I did not get the seat that I had pre-requested however I finished with a better seat. Flight service perfectly adequate and I was spoken to in English when they realised I was not a native Russian speaker. I had no problems on what was a comfortable flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,7,2010-11-27,Bangkok to Almaty. Very full flight and a booking error in my row which resulted an upgrade to Business Class. Food and service quite friendly with some preferences being given to those who had paid full business class fares. Seats were comfortable recliners and I was a little surprised with the legroom. Service was good and the English better than I expected. Economy class gives value for money but I think that Business Class does not.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Air Astana customer review,6,2010-10-07,GUW-ALA in Y and ALA-URA in C; both flights on older and somewhat stuffy 757s which however have generous legroom in economy and plenty of space in business. Seats in business are rather tired but still comfortable and service is very good; Air Astana FA's are always professional and friendly. Good food both in economy and business. Flights operated on time. Overall this again was a good experience and I would recommend using KC rather than other domestic carriers (which are to be honest very few in Kazakhstan).,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Air Astana customer review,9,2010-06-21,URA-PEK via ALA return in Y. Checked-in online but offered a better seat at the airport which is nice of check-in agents. Domestic legs on newish A319 with plenty of legroom in economy. ALA-PEK on rather tired B767 with ancient bulky ceiling TV-sets and stale interiors but the flight and service very good. Had seats 29A+B for myself (exit row seats) on both flights with huge legroom. Special meal delivered as requested. ALA-PEK-ALA are the night flights so service was unobtrusive if you like which is good for couple of hours sleep. Excellent experience with Air Astana (although no competition whatsoever in the local market therefore fares are quite expensive.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,4,2010-06-12,Dubai-Almaty-Ust-Kamenogorsk-Astana-Dubai. Later part of May - beginning June 2010. Flight to Ust-Kamenogorsk via Almaty not too bad or unpleasant considering I was en route already for 25 days (spending 18 hours in horrible Dubai Airport). My suitcase was damaged by rough handling. The flight Ust-Kamenogorsk to Astana was not bad either. Astana-Dubai flight started with a hiccup - since the customs people did not know where Namibia is and I was looked at very suspiciously despite having a private Visa and being with my Kazakhstan wife. The flight was very unpleasant - seats the most uncomfortable for such a flight! Attendants not interested in making the flight a wee-bit more comfortable. Prices not too bad - however flying to the destinations I need to go to there is no alternative to compare. Being the national airline there is much room for improvement.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Air Astana customer review,9,2010-05-24,I never had much of an issue with this airline. Ppolite staff food very reasonable a good selection of drinks and in-flight entertainment. On occasion the flights can be late but this is more due to the weather and the odd mechanical hiccup however this has improved. You may find this airline very expensive (Amsterdam to Atyrau) with 50% saving to be had via other routings. These comments relate to trips Amsterdam to Atyrau Atyrau to Aktau and Istanbul to Atyrau over the last 3 years.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Air Astana customer review,5,2010-01-29,I flew to Bangkok from Almaty December 2009. We had trouble at the beginning. Although we checked in on the website they couldn't provide the same seats so we had to sit separately from my wife. They also sold 1 ticket for 2 people but they just couldn't do anything with the situation. The only way would've been to seat one of these guys to the business class. We waited 2 hours on the plane (of course some people missed their connection in Bangkok in the result of this unprofessionalism) until they saw no other solution but that. Very unprofessional attitude. Later on cabin crew were helpful and friendly food was OK good classical music channel to listen airplane relatively new clean very small legroom though for a tall guy.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,3,2010-01-23,A terrible business class lounge. I had to pay for everything except water and cola. They have launched a web check-in service but do not have a terminal to print the boarding pass at the airport. I find it rather uncomfortable due to the fact that you can't often find a printer when traveling on business trips. On my last trip I've checked-in online printed my boarding pass but I have learned that my seat doesn't exist because they've changed the plane. I've found it out only when I was onboard. Maybe not so terrible but not too good.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Air Astana customer review,9,2009-11-23,I recently flew Air Astana from Almaty to Dubai and return and I must say I was impressed with the level of service. We were late out of Almaty but that was not a real problem as the service on the plane was professional. The seat pitch is okay for the 4 hour or so flight to Dubai as is the food. Entertainment was via overhead video units but it was fine to view. No problems with disembarking in Dubai. Equally the return flight was good leaving Dubai at 2300 - good food and service on board.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,7,2009-09-07,"GUW-AMS B767-300 Business class. I have to say the service has greatly improved. The seating is classic but very spacious. The plane is aging but clean. The onboard service is fair to good and IFE surprisingly diverse. I checked no for ""value"" for money because this ticket costs double the price of a twice as long flight on CX or AF.",False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Air Astana customer review,8,2009-08-23,Have flown several times on Almaty - Bangkok route. Whilst not at the level of top airlines I had no problems at all. Flights on time. Food OK. Planes relatively new and clean. Happy to continue as is quickest route for me and no complaints.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,7,2009-07-26,GUW-IST-GUW A320. Check in smooth and the flight was on time. The plane was a new A320. IFE was limited but this was a 3.5 hour flight. The onboard service was adequate for a medium haul economy class flight. No complaints except for the incredible rise of prices on Air Astana International flights. From Kazakhstan we do not have much choice of airlines and Air Astana is still the only one with a descent safety record so I prefer to use it despite the ever increasing prices.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Air Astana customer review,1,2009-07-07,"The comments about this airline mostly relate to their international flights and I understand that they offer a good service there. It's a different story on their internal and regional flights. I booked on-line for the short hop return from Bishkek to Almaty. It seemed like a good idea at the time but proved to be a disaster. The airline changed their schedule without informing me their records apparently said that they had ""tried to contact me"" - I'm not even sure how. I turned up at the airport and waited for 5 hours assuming that it had simply been delayed for that time only to find out that they had moved me not to that flight but to one 20 hours earlier. The Air Astana agent acted as though he hadn't seen an e-ticket before claimed I hadn't paid for the outward journey or maybe hadn't paid at all - really any excuse to not allow me onto the plane. I had no alternative but to go back to Bishkek and travel overland the next day - all at my own expense of course. The return flight had been similarly moved but a local agent helped me out to properly arrange that one and got a refund for the outward journey. I complained to Air Astana as my non-arrival had seriously thrown out the plans of my hosts in Almaty not just mine. No answer. I complained again only to receive a fob off reply that they regretted this but they weren't going to do anything further about it and hoped that I would fly with them again: I doubt that very much. I've given 1 rather than 0 as the Almaty to Bishkek ""return"" flight itself wasn't bad. Their ground service and support in these regional centres very much needs to upgraded to the same standard as their flight experience.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Air Astana customer review,9,2009-06-21,Air Astana is right up there with other non-mainstream airlines who do more to please than most. Great service great food an interior decor and outside livery that have a quality design. Air Astana customers include many oil industry personnel who have flown often worldwide and positive comments are often noticeable among passengers. Agree with a previous comment about FAs who are very pleasant. Service to Atyrau has improved leaps and bounds from the days when a worker cigarette in mouth and large hosepipe in hand used to bang the hull of the plane to talk to the pilot about refuelling. The airport is still a bus station though.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,9,2009-06-04,Almaty - Atyrau - Amsterdam in Business. Seats are comfortable although not lay flat and space is more than enough. Their duvets are perfect. Cabin crew very friendly and helpful. Food is good service is second to none. Aircraft was clean and flights operated on time. On the ground staff are very helpful. However the Business class lounge is severely lacking in facilities in Almaty. Not even free drinks. In Atyrau there are no Business class facilities at all! Terminal facilities generally in Atyrau are severely lacking. Its not possible to get any refreshments in any way shape or form once you are in the departure lounge. Thankfully if you are just transiting through Atyrau to Almaty or vice versa you're not in there long. All in all very pleased with service its just a shame that terminal facilities let down the rest of the service. Sort that out and its 10/10! Keep up the good work.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,8,2009-03-29,The have good cabin crew quality of food is good. Their fleet is new enough and I know from some sources that they do their best to provide safety and best service. Sometimes it seems that the prices are too high but if you order tickets via internet you will get a discount especially on trips with some promotions. But this service is worth to be paid.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Air Astana customer review,8,2009-03-26,Moscow-Astana-Almaty return. First sectors a 3.5h night flight and wasn't really crowded. I had a row for myself so laid down and had a sleep. Unfortunately after 1h they switched on the lights and served some food. I tried to continue my sleep. As we were delayed and as I didn't have an absolute proper Visa it took me a while for immigration. Searching my bag was easy even I was late and the belts already stopped. Air Astana had some helpful staff there and got my Bag from the luggage room in a minute. Finally I didn't catch my connecting flight. But the rebooking to the next Astana-Almaty flight worked without problems on this Airport. On this flight they served breakfast that was OK. ALA Airport is hell. Staff (even Air Astana check- in) is nearly not speaking English and to get to the domestic check-in you have to have a print out of your ticket as they don't know what an e-ticket is. Staff in-flight was always kind and helpful and had a good English.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
