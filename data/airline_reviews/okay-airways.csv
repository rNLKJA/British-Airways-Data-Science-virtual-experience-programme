Okay Airways customer review,4,2014-08-26,Second trip with Okay Airways. This time from Dalian to Yantai in a MA-60 a Chinese turboprop that seats about 50 passengers with 2+2 abreast seating. Flight takes only about 40 minutes in the air. Price was pretty reasonable given the length of the flight and that flying a Chinese-made aircraft means no taxes. Seats bit cramped - I had to stretch my legs in the aisle. No screens of any kind just magazines in the seat pocket acceptable for a regional flight - but that does not mean that there should be chewing gum gluing the pages together! Nothing to eat or drink - no bottled water no bags of nuts. The only flight attendant was invisible through out the flight. Arrived on time. Overall not a pleasant experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,False
Okay Airways customer review,6,2012-11-27,Xian MA-60 on JMU-HRB is much better alternative than train or bus. Cabin reasonable for regional flights. We got a bottle of mineral water which was put on every seat. The only flight attendant was hidden for a 50 minutes long flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,,,4,,True
Okay Airways customer review,7,2012-11-14,BK2823 TSN-XIY. Not as bad as I thought - very cheap no IFE pretty bad meal but still a meal nonetheless. Aircraft was an older 737-800 but was perfectly clean. Service was efficient but brash. Chinese regulations mean that you can't use your mobile phone any time during the flight even in flight mode and they do enforce this.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,5,,True
Okay Airways customer review,8,2011-07-29,"JNZ-DLC. Flight departed and arrived on schedule. Aircraft was newish MA60 clean and tidy. Cabin announcements in English as well as Chinese but no cabin service - only 1 hour flight so acceptable especially given price of ticket RMB 240! Aircraft named ""Modern Ark 60"" apt as modernised Chinese version of old Antinov24 design. Overall perfectly acceptable.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True
