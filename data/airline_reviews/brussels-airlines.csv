"""I was being punished for being a vegan""",1,2022-11-15,"November 10, 2022 I traveled with Brussels Airlines and Lufthansa from Atlanta to Banjul. Two days prior to my trip, I called their customer service to inform them that I was a vegan and would like to be served vegan meals for my journey. I think I speak for many when I say my expectations are always low when it comes to airlines food. Gone are the days when you use to get decent meals on the air whilst traveling. So I really wasn't expecting much. Just a whatever meal until I get to my destination. Well to my disappointment, on all of my transits flights I was only served one vegan meal, that is unacceptable. On the Atlanta flight to Frankfurt, I was served rice with a few vegetables for dinner, which was fine, no complaints there. Then comes breakfast time, everybody was given their whatever meal and I was told that they only have an apple for me, ""the flight attendance exact words to me were, ""well you a vegan right, I can only give you the apple."" I respectfully said no thank you to her. Everybody else was given their whatever meal which was a sandwich, yogurt and an apple. My flight from Brussels to Banjul, again I was served some nasty looking what looked like beans with some red sauce over couscous and that was all I got. For breakfast, they gave me and everyone else a big waffle which I didn't eat because I suspected there might be eggs in it. These airlines should do better in the ways they treat people.  I went online and booked my ticket to fit my travel needs and at a price that was affordable to me. So when I tell you am a vegan, you should make the proper accommodations for me, this was a very long journey with very short transit time. It was very intense running from one gate to another trying to catch the next flight, I expected a better service once am in the plane.

Never happened, but this time it did. As it was a night-flight I should have booked on the day of arrival, not a day before. Even though there were still seats left I was not allowed to fly and was escorted from the plane. From that point nobody of Brussels Airlines did anything. Middle of the night, left alone, no rebooking, no nothing. Only comments 'your flight has left, your problem, goodbye'. Let me be clear: I passed all security, customs, lounge and final boarding with a passed ticket! If anyone would have noticed I could have rebooked on the spot as I had a flexible business ticket! Brussels Airlines did not care about anything. Just kicked off the plane and left alone. Up to now nobody of Brussels Airlines has responded to my filed complaint.

My flight experience was kind of average, my ticket costed about 600 Euros roundtrip, which was pretty expansive for an only carry-on luggage allowance ticket, but it was my fault due to late purchase of the tickets. If purchasing in advance, I could've saved 50% of the price of the tickets, which is a pretty good price considering it's not a low-cost airline, well, not exactly. I had an early morning flight, departing at approx. 05:00 AM. The flight was unofficially delayed. It wasn't announced but it did occure, it was a 30 minute delay caused by computers of the airport which shut down, not the airline's fault. We boarded rather quickly and took our seats. I found the seats to be a bit narrow. The staff on board was mostly friendly, especially one flight attendant which her name I don't remember, before take-off when I panicked a bit due to safety reasons talked to me and made me feel safe and calm. The other crew members weren't that friendly, average I would say. After take off it was asked of passengers near the window to close their window shades and let everyone sleep. So until 30 minutes before landing shades were off and everybody tried to take a nap. Fortunately I sat in an emergency isle seat (which I booked in the online check-in, for free) and had some legroom. I don't know how much legroom other passengers had but I imagine it wasn't as comfortable. Before landing a trolly passed for purchasing food and drinks. I ordered a coffee which was dull and not tasty, I think all airlines in the end serve bad coffee, don't they? Overall my experience was pretty average, not extraordinary good, or bad. I would say to sum up that Brussels Airlines is to be treated as a semi-low-cost airline. They weren't harsh on their policies, but it is nothing like a traditional airline, and it was felt.

The table slid out easily from the left-hand side; there are two very convenient storage areas to the left and in front; the seat has numerous options and was easy to control; and the 4K screen was beautiful and was positioned exactly right – not too close and not too far. The attitude of the cabin crew was brilliant. They were efficient, smart and attentive but not too overbearing. It would have been nice to have been given a drink before takeoff although the seats all had a water bottle. Meal service was done by giving a choice of two dishes as it was served and all the options looked good. I opted for the smoked duck breast, meatloaf tenderloin and cheese. The wine selection was slightly limited because of the pandemic (something common with most airlines but they served an excellent French red followed by port. Being Belgium’s national airline there was a nice selection of beers – I tried the Tripel Karmeliet which was excellent. Leaving the aircraft was done efficiently and one of the advantages of operating under covid rules is that leaving is done strictly by row and so there was no mad rush to get off or a race to reach immigration first.

Called Brussels Airlines in Brussels and they confirmed there were four bags (two extra) Washington to Uganda on the website but this later disappeared. Brussels Air manager in Dulles said computer no longer showed either of the two extra bags Washington to Brussels to Uganda. He said pay another $400 and they would refund. But they didn't refund and wouldn't answer inquiries about the claim several weeks later. Then they lost the bags in Brussels for two days and failed to track them on the computer when found. The Dulles baggage agent said Brussels Air is the worst handling baggage and might lose them for a week or two. I called Brussels again and found they were on their way to Uganda. Six hours after my call they were still shown as lost on the computer. Bags came a day late and we had to pay a taxi $200 to transfer them across the country to our destination. On return the Brussels - Washington trip was cancelled at the last minute after departure from Entebbe and they tried to send us through Frankfurt instead of switching to United/Brussels to DC. We complained and they permitted the United flight. But we had paid for economy plus and United didn't respect that so we had to pay again.

The promise was that a spare seat would be left to give passengers more room. The flight was full, so every place was taken (this is probably always the case) and no difference between business and economy! Due to the airline having to remove luggage from the hold, we were held up for an hour on the plane and we were not offered a drink! I’ve never travelled in any business class where I haven’t been served a drink before take off.  On this flight, as soon as take off was done the staff pulled the little cabin curtain and had a coffee together. Some crew had boarded the plane and were all sat in the business section which added to the “no spare seat” situation. It was at least 15 minutes before they started organising the service! There are no staff designated to business so you wait the same for service as in economy except you are served your meal first,  but need to attract attention thereafter if you need anything else. We were served a hot meal .. no choice at all, just handed a box. Not even on a tray with salt and pepper, a cup for coffee or a cheese and biscuit. Just the hot meal in its container and a knife and fork in a small packet. The meal ( mainly potatoes with a few sad pieces of beef) is worth about €11 to purchase in economy, and for that you have a choice! In economy if you buy wine it will cost you €6 and you get a bottle. In business we were served from an open bottle. I can honestly say I am glad that I got my business ticket by bidding to pay €50 more, and that I didn’t pay the incredible price of a normal business ticket on Brussels airlines. Business tickets under this system of bidding, by the way, do not give access to the business lounge in the airport- for that you have to pay €30 per person more. Needless to say I cancelled my bid for a business class upgrade for the return trip. The return was in economy one week later on Thursday 17th October (flight number SN3855).

It then took the three attendants another hour and a half to reach the back of the plane with drinks and food. Every time a hot meal was ready it seemed to take them another ten minutes to get going with their trolly again! They stopped to deal with every hot food error (there seemed to be a lot!) and kept the rest of the plane waiting.

The inflight service was efficient, apart from the fact that they didn't accept debit cards, and I had no other way to pay. The layover in Brussels was fairly uneventful, and I managed to grab a bite to eat. After a while, my gate was announced, and I headed to the gate. I got to the plane, and I realized it was the exact same plane, and I was sat on the exact same seat. Dirty window again. After takeoff, the inflight service began, and again I was unable to purchase anything. After a very short flight, we landed into Heathrow, and I was faced with a 55 minute line at immigration, so by the time I got out, I wasn't very happy. I personally wouldn't take this flight again.

We had provided our food choices (vegetarian food and child meals), while booking the tickets. Thus, the airline had almost 9 months to prepare our meals.

What I was offered instead was non-vegetarian food; when I said 'no', I was offered just a plate with fruit salad and the dessert. I refused that saying that I had pre-booked meals for the family while booking the tickets. The flight crew was a mix of Belgians and an Indian. The two Belgian ladies serving the food just gave up and one of them was not even apologetic and just said - we cannot do anything about it. After a while, the Indian air-hostess came and offered me the child menu. Again ridiculous, but at least she was apologetic about the situation. The child menu contained soggy french fries - never seen worse french fries before. Secondly, the food service was started quite late during the flight. I have flown with various airlines for the last 14 years and from experience I know that on long-distance flights food service and trash collection is completed at least 20 minutes before the flight lands. In this case, there were people still in the toilet 7 minutes before the landing. I have flown with Brussels Airlines both to India and US. Although, the flights to US are not great compared to other airlines, I see a clear difference as to how the flights are handled and how the crew behaves depending on whether the flight is to/from India or US.

I was offered no explanation for the cancellation and when I asked was told it was 'crewing problems'. I asked if I could go on the 06.15 flight next morning, they seemed surprised I knew about this and was told three times that 'it is already overbooked by four passengers'. I then asked what I was supposed to do for the night and told to go home; I pointed out that I lived a two hour drive from the airport and was very reluctantly booked into a hotel. On arriving at the airport the next morning I discovered that the 06.15 flight had also been cancelled, so two flights, one of which was 'overbooked', cancelled.

To extremely poor handling of our luggage claim, we were told that they were only responsible getting us point to point, the fact our jackets didn't arrive and we were forced to take a cab to our hotel wasn't their problem.

"""they seem to have taken a nosedive""",2,2018-01-12,"I have been using Brussels Airlines for some connections from Uganda to European cities (Brussels and London). The quality of flights is basic, but they are one of increasingly limited options. In my last flight (Entebbe to London via Brussels SN467/SN2093 on 13/12/2017) they seem to have taken a nosedive. The airline initially announced that the flight leaving Entebbe would make an unplanned stop at Kigali, before continuing to Brussels. Thus they allowed boarding of Kigali-bound passengers and asked all to ignore the seat allocation printed on their boarding passes. The boarding was delayed and disorganised. Once on the plane, someone worked out that the detour would have exceeded the maximum allowable work hours for the crew. The plan was changed back to the original direct flight to Brussels, but now they had to disembark the Kigali-bound passengers! This caused chaos: loud complaints by the passengers who had been promised transport to Kigali, refusals to disembark, ridiculous threats by some members of the crew that the flight would just take off for Brussels with any Kigali-bound passenger that did not disembark, overall not a very professional image for Brussels Airlines. Eventually all Kigali-bound passengers disembarked after promises of local hotel accommodation and a flight next morning. Then Brussels-bound passengers were asked to move to their initially allocated seats, multiple counts and baggage checks had to be done and eventually the flight took off 3 hours and 20 minutes later than scheduled. I managed to make the connection in Brussels (the London flight was also delayed over 1 hour) but my baggage did not, so in London I had to make a claim at the counter with a number of other unfortunate travellers from Entebbe. The customer service employee apologised for a computer malfunction that prevented proper tracking of my baggage, but promised that I would get the baggage later in the evening, asked for my address and gave me a phone number to call. He said to purchase any essential toiletries and retain receipts for reimbursement. I reached my destination, and in the evening I called the number, but the delivery company did not have any record of my baggage. The next morning, same thing. I purchased some toiletries. The baggage was finally delivered late at night on the second day. I thought I should at least claim reimbursement for the toiletries and went to the Brussels Airlines website, entered my flight details etc. and got an automated acknowledgement email in a few minutes, pre-emptively apologising for possible delays in getting back to me.

"""used valuable points for this bad experience""",4,2017-11-11,"✅ Verified Review |  We flew two very different aircraft during our travel from Washington to Madrid via Brussels. The first and last flight (out of four) were on an A330-200 which are configured for business and economy only. We traveled in business and hoped for a good experience as we used valuable star alliance points. The service was very good on our first flight to Brussels: flight attendants were wonderful and fun, food was ok, entertainment ok (but system is great) and it was easy on and easy off. The seat and cabin left much to be desired. The aircraft was uncomfortably hot, sweltering hot, and I just couldn't get comfortable enough to sleep well. The seat itself is awkward to say the least. I've traveled both business and first, trans-Atlantic and Pacific, in at least 9 other airlines, some frequently, and this seat was by far the most clumsy and uncomfortable. My husband and I are both tall and we found the way the seat reclines forces your feet into this very small compartment in which you then need to push yourself back up from to reposition yourself properly on the reclines seat. My husband’s feet could not move within this small compartment as they fit in like a glove and limited his ability to move around and settle. In most airlines you have two controls for you seat: one easily accessible when seated and one when lying down. Same here but during your repositioning neither becomes easy to reach and you have to hoist yourself up to reach again. There is no mid-range adjustment either. They have a recline position but if you don't like that one you have to choose between completely upright or full recline; no in-between or other adjustments! You can, however, just raise your leg rest. Little to no storage except in that little foot compartment I mentioned, which by the way goes away when you recline to flat bed. No place for your laptop, handbag or iPad when you sleep. I felt cramped. The food was ok. Wine and beer choices excellent. Entertainment choices were very weak but they did try and provide a good global sampling. The screen was very easy to use, sound good and no technical issues. On our trip back we had a less than pleasant server. I felt the simplest of requests (that I only have an appetizer and not dinner and receive my cheese course for a main) was met with a huff and near eye roll. I did notice our particular flight attendant complained to everyone working on board in ear shot of passengers about her job, conditions, other 'issues' on the plane. Fortunately not about passengers. Perhaps I just had ‘grumpy’ as my attendant. Again, this second flight was hot and uncomfortable. Several of the passengers complained and there was one flight attendant trying to communicate this to the pilot and we did receive some relief for a few hours. In general if you are traveling from the USA to Europe I think I would try and avoid Brussels Airlines. My husband who travels internationally most weeks, always business or first, said Brussels is his least favorite. I know it is hard to complain when we have the ability to fly in a premium cabin but we usually pay dearly for them. I am sad we used valuable points for this bad experience. On a positive note: Brussels airport is a dream.

The onboard entertainment was very poor and as usual with this airline I couldn't wait to get off at Brussels despite Brussels airport being the most miserable transit in Europe. The transit from Gate B at 5 in the morning directs you to bunch of G4s staff having breakfast who order you to ignore the signs and continue further on. 4 hours in this dirty and soulless place where the staff are ordered not to talk to you, look you in the eye or smile. Then came boarding for Heathrow. The flight had a large number of West Africans in transit to the UK and both airport and airline appear to have a policy to treat these passengers with disdain. They announced boarding about an hour before the flight so we queued and waited half an hour while the boarding staff chatted. Another half an hour to check travel documents and boarding passes but somebody had forgotten to open the doors to the ramp so passenger just backed up and waited resulting in an hour late departure. On my outward journey I noticed that they herd all Africa bound passenger to T Gate where there there is a glass divide with some facilities but no shops, eateries or duty free shops for waiting passengers. In a conversation with an African colleague he commented that Africans are poorly treated at Brussels airport and I have heard this many times over.  On the final leg we were lucky enough to have one passenger who chose to scream out biblical passages and sing hymns at the top of her voice. The cabin crew could have politely asked her to respect her fellow passengers but they just ignored it. A journey from hell with the unfriendliest airline and airport.

Our car service driver charged us a hefty sum for all this extra waiting time as well. When our luggage finally did arrive, not all of it was there. We were busy looking for a box we took a long and couldn't find it. Nobody was there to help us, we tried talking to people but to no avail. Nobody knew how to help us and how to handle the situation. So we left without the last piece of luggage. We called the airport to file a missing item, but no one was willing to help. It took us several days and several trips to the airport to track the missing luggage. We spent the first week of our vacation tracking luggage. We weren't helped by any airport or phone staff, and were left spending loads of money on car services back and forth from the airport to find the missing luggage. Finally when we did track the luggage the airline didn't want to pay for the delivery. It certainly wasn't a great way to spend vacation.

I did receive a newspaper and a coke with one ice cube. Must describe FA as correct but not friendly - cold meal was horrible cold stodgy rice with some shrimps and a sweet and sour sauce - lucky there was a very small piece of cheese and 2 chocolates - plastic cutlery in business class. Choice of drinks was not presented - so I went for a second coke once again with one ice cube. One of the poorest business class services.

Brussels Airlines customer review,,2015-03-19,Had a flight from Brussels to Ouagadougou Burkina Faso which was scheduled 4 hour and 55 minutes. They re routed us with other flights to Accra Ghana then to Abdijan then to Ouagadougou to pick up more passengers. We flew right over Ouagadougou and this added 5 hours 20 minutes to our route.

Crew were excellent and efficient. No IFE and the food and beverage is pay as you go (I had a cold drink). This is a regional low frills carrier but several steps above the budget alternatives available.

The return flight was delayed by 14 hours once again without explanation. The seats are uncomfortable. The hotel that we were put up in was a cheap transit type hotel with poor beds bedding and pillows. There were no curtains at the window either. The airline is trying to portray itself as a large national carrier but it is nothing more than a “tin-pot” disorganised budget airline.

Brussels Airlines customer review,3,2015-02-18,PRG-BRU-EDI Brussels Airlines is effectively a low-cost airline disguised as a proper national flag-carrier. Cramped aircraft with extremely uncomfortable seats and on both legs of my flight absolutely no overhead luggage space meaning that I had to keep my briefcase under my feet. There were two of us in our party and yet somehow we weren't seated next to each other - and the issue was explained to me as being unsolvable by ground staff. Absurd amounts of queuing for boarding and disembarking although the way boarding was called- one would believe that there was some logic being employed. Absolutely nothing is handed for free if you are flying Economy - not even water which again goes back to the point that they are operating as a low-cost carrier. Cost of a tickets is slightly lower than the cost of ticket on e.g. Lufthansa but not as low as Easyjet or Ryanair both of which in my opinion offer a direct service superior to Brussels Airlines. Also on a side note - Brussels Airport which is the airline's hub is a nightmare.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,,,2,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,7,2015-01-14,LHR-BRU return on A319. Small old aircraft. Seats unbelievably thin and hard even less comfy than LCC like AirAsia. Both legs departed late.

For a very short flight not bad at all.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,3,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,5,2015-01-11,We flew the LIS-BRU flight leg thinking it would be a TAP flight. Unfortunately we got to experience the true horror of flying low-cost and paying normal carrier prices. No free food or drinks included. The seat must have been the worst seat I had ever sat on during a flight. Like somebody else said an iron board with a leather cover. They revisited the concept of a head rest and installed instead a flat rock to rest your head on. I guess the hard plastic of the front seat in my knees came should not have been a surprise after this. In BRU airport we were taken to the non-Schengen terminal and then with a bus to the luggage terminal. Outside through rain and snow.

Thankfully Brussels-Warsaw was also late and it the only reason I made it to the gates on time. This and that I was able to run and without kids. On this flight there was not enough space to put my bag in overhead compartment designated for my seat. I asked FA to help me and she just said ""You will have to keep it under your seat"" without even bothering to check if any space was available.

Brussels Airlines customer review,9,2014-11-20,Brussels-Lisbon 9 Nov 2014 and back 12 Nov. The plane was an A320 both ways. Departed with a delay of 10 minutes in Brussels and arrived 10 minutes early at Lisbon Airport. Plane was not full that Sunday morning (departure was 11.20). Entertainment was the flight info and some cartoons played at the general screens. FA's were very professional and friendly. For Light&Relax food and drinks were for purchase. Luggage arrived in Lisbon 30 minutes after landing. The return flight to Brussels (departure 13u45) was completely full. This time no entertainment for the 2h25 flight. Departed and landed on time. FA's this time were also very friendly and professional. One of the FA's on the flight to Lisbon recognized us and asked how was our trip to Lisbon. Arrival in Brussels was at the B- terminal (non Schengen) and we must go by bus to the Schengen terminal. Before arrival the crew announced the connecting gates for passengers in transit.

Brussels Airlines customer review,3,2014-11-20,Brussels have downgraded their intercontinental economy passengers so they don't even qualify for a snack on the connecting flights to Brussels. The flight attendants have no idea about the small print that says if you show a boarding card for the intercontinental leg you get a complimentary drink.

Booked the last economy seat on the flight for whopping 560 Euros. Personal space was poor and the aircraft seemed configured for the maximum seat count. Flight was 1-stop with a stop at their depressingly dull and chaotic Brussels where I had to wait 3 hours for their delayed connection to BHX. The plane turned out to be a Dash-8 Q400 turboprop. Other airlines inform you about the plane in use Brussels Airlines does not and I wouldn't have booked an insanely expensive but poor quality flight if I had known what kind of airline this is.

Once on board hoping to get same great experience but wrong was I only 1 row of C class and with 3 pax. Service was appalling and uneventful. Quick flight.

Brussels Airlines customer review,,2014-11-03,"We were two couples flying to Milan to celebrate a 50th birthday of one of the wives. Arrived at Manchester checked in for 6.25 am flight to Brussels. We sat on the plane for over an hour waiting for other passengers to be boarded due to lack of check in staff at Manchester. We finally took off an hour late at 7.25am. Prior to landing announcement on plane stated that New York flight had been held for passengers but all others would have to be transferred in other words we had missed our connecting flights! Upon arrival we were met by a female Brussels airline employee who just handed us new tickets and said we had been re-routed via Munich to Milan and to make matters worse to Milan Malpensa airport and not Linate airport (Linate is much nearer to Milan). She could not explain why it was okay to hold the plane in Manchester for over an hour to accommodate late passengers but they were unable to do so for us and the other passengers who missed connecting flights. We were not even shown where to go to check in for the rescheduled flights. Appalling customer service! We did try to complain at the Brussels airlines ""help"" desk but where met by a wall of indifference they did offer us 8 euro food vouchers. To cut a long story short we lost almost a full day of our holiday. We will never use them again.",False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,1,,False,

Legroom was in coach was about 33-34 inches the most generous I've seen in recent memory. Food was good and reasonably plentiful and cabin staff passed through the aisles at least once every 30 minutes to refill water cups.

Brussels Airlines customer review,8,2014-09-09,This was a short chaotic hop from Brussels to Heathrow - Flight 2093 - on 4th September 2013. Boarding was via coach between the terminals and was chaotic. There was no priority boarding for business class it was pretty much a free for all. We were greeted by a friendly purser who showed us to our seats but did pretty much little else even when someone tried to help themselves to the free middle seats in business class until I asked her to. The plane took off 35 minutes late as then kept trying to cram passengers on consequently there was no pre flight drink. Breakfast was chucked at us 10 minutes into the flight. It consisted of half a roll with cheese and ham a yoghurt and a fruity selection which was served with a glass of champagne served from a big bottle. Service was pretty indifferent but in their defence the place was completely full. We landed at Heathrow 30 minutes late with baggage arriving in my case 20 minutes later. In my partners case 35 minutes late as despite being tagged priority was last off.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,4,,,5,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,9,2014-09-09,JFK to Brussels on September 3rd in Business class and were seated in 4A and 4C. We boarded the plane and were greeted by a lovely female member if crew who took our glasses and offered us a Kir Royale before takeoff. I noticed that on this run we were only offered the one rather than refills. The flight took off from JFK on time after a long taxi. 20 minutes after the seat belt light was switched off we were offered a drink which was served with a bowl of olives. Probably a figment of my imagination but the drink service didn't seem as generous on this flight and the meal service seemed to have been downgraded - for example there was no Star Chef selection on this flight. The monthly cocktail also has been downgraded to a monthly beer. Menu cards were distributed and an amenity kit with not much in handed out - usefully though it doubles as an IPad holder which is a nice touch. Twenty minutes later the meal service began. Starters were a choice of Smoked breast of duck or Green tea dusted seaweed wrapped scallop. I had the scallop which was terrific. Mains were a choice of Sesame Crusted Beef with butternut squash purée or Herb crusted seared salmon with a tomato courgette gratin or Blue Cheese Gnocchi with sautéed spinach. I had the beef which could have been hotter to be honest but was still excellent. I chose an excellent 2012 South African Chenin Blanc which was recommended by the purser and was a great choice. This was followed by a cheese plate. The meal service took about an hour of the 6.5 hour night flight. After dinner I stretched out in the large lie flat bed and settled back to watch a movie as I thought it was pointless to try and get loads of sleep. Crew came round a couple of times with water. The seat is very comfortable and the massage function nice. There was also a better selection of films on this flight that were more up to date than my previous flight. An hour before landing we were served a continental breakfast of fruit yoghurt and warm bread with fruit juice and coffee before landing in Brussels around 20 minutes early. The crew were lovely on this flight led by a male purser they were warm friendly professional and respectful which I liked. I noticed that the box of chocolates given on the outward flight was replaced by a much smaller packet of Almond Thins. The service offered by Brussels Airlines for the price is brilliant. It takes you back to days when airline actually cared about their customers which I found refreshing and enjoyable.,False,,,Business Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,9,2014-09-01,Brussels to JFK on SN501 on 24th August - we travelled in Business Class - seats 2A and 2C. Upon boarding the flight our jackets were taken and stowed by friendly crew and we were offered pre take off drinks including Champagne and a delicious Kir Royale. The first thing that grabbed me was the size of the seat which has a great amount of space around it and the large TV screen in the seat which is great. The flight took off on time and shortly after pre lunch drinks were served with a smoked salmon and caviar appetiser. The crew distributed the menus with food including dishes created by Michelin Star restaurateur Thomas Locus. The lunch menu consisted of a starter of either Romaine Lettuce Salad served with North Sea shrimp and avocado or Middle Eastern Style Lamb served with baba ghanoush. I had the shrimp it was one of the most attractively presented dishes that I have had in a plane and it was delicious. Mains were a choice of Waterzooi style farm raised chicken with IJsvaller watercress and ravioli with ox heart cabbage or Fillet of Cod with verge sauce and roast potatoes with Rosemary and sugar snap peas or Agnolotti pasta with arugula sauce. I had the chicken which was succulent and juicy and delicious. It's also worth mentioning that my travelling companion had ordered a Lacto Vegetarian meal which as a main was a superb Mushroom and Spinach curry. We were then offered a cheese plate and dessert. There was a decent selection of wines available which were generously topped up throughout the meal. After lunch we settled back to relax for a few hours - the seat extends into a bed which is very comfortable and enabled me to sleep. Crew served ice cream and drinks runs were regularly offered. The big let down was the inflight entertainment which was pretty disappointing with a mediocre selection of film and TV series available - luckily I had my trusty IPad so was able to catch up on some stuff I had downloaded. 90 minutes before JFK a snack was served - this was a goats cheese salad with duck and apricots which was delicious. Crew were lovely throughout and provided a great unobtrusive service. A nice touch was we were given a box of Neuhaus chocolates each to thank us for flying with them. We arrived in JFK 45 minutes early relaxed and refreshed having thoroughly enjoyed the experience before bracing ourselves for the hour long queue at Immigration.,False,,,Business Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,True,

This entitled me to fast lane security and a snack (pizza) on board and drinks included. Additionally you could buy lounge access at another 15 euros which I did. Lounge at gate A section was on the small side but standard snacks/sandwiches provided. Staff onboard/lounge/check in were very friendly and able to communicate in Dutch. Flight was operated with a 319 and I was seated on row 2. Leg-space was minimal and no separation was made on board (1 row c class-1 pax) row 2-3 Eco flex rest economy with BOB.

Brussels Airlines customer review,9,2014-08-26,"Party of two business class on an Avro RJ from Stockholm-Bromma to Brussels. Facilities at Bromma are quite desolate and overpriced though I don't suppose that's Brussels Airlines fault. However they probably have enough influence to put in some more chairs. Despite the fact that the terminal is essentially a re-purposed hangar it is in a great location and for that reason we were thankful that Brussels Airlines flew there instead of the more crowded and less convenient Arlanda Airport. Once we got on board we were somewhat surprised that the business class seats were identical in their physicality to those in the economy sections. However our fears that we had not gotten what we paid for were lifted once we discovered that the seats were quite comfortable and the legroom between the seat and the bulkhead (The Avro’s sole row of business class seats is the front-most row just behind the bulkhead) was more than adequate and the flight attendants were very attentive spoke decent English and served meals that were in their quality above the normality for short-haul flights. Hot washcloths were available at the beginning of the flight and later on upon request. No ""real"" IFE but newspapers in a variety of languages were given to the business class passengers as were various magazines some published by the airline some not. I read the New York Times and the Economist both of which were available in English. The airline also had a magazine in English French and German highlighting its various destinations.

Brussels Airlines customer review,3,2014-08-18,With one exception most aspects of my flight were either good or average. Unfortunately the ill-designed seats on their long haul flight mean that I wont be flying with them again until I am certain that their fleet of Airbus A330's have been replaced. The seats have hard and thick adjustable headrests which appear to have been added as an afterthought meaning that the head is pushed 7cm or so forward of the shoulders. This affected all of the similarly disgruntled passengers in my vicinity with the exception of children not big enough to reach the headrest. If you are planning a trip with Brussels Airlines try sitting with your head stuck out 7cm forward of your shoulders whilst going through the booking procedure and see how it feels. Then imagine how it will feel after 8 hours and book with a different airline. There are about 5 airlines running between Europe and Uganda now and nothing would make me choose Brussels above the others. It is a shame that something so easy to get right as a seat which is the same shape as a human being renders this airline unusable because the rest of the service was fine and timings excellent.

Brussels Airlines customer review,2,2014-08-13,BRU-CPH. Economy flex. Brussels airlines operates this route as a duopoly with SAS and it shows in the fares that are charged. My travel plans depended on the weather forecast in Denmark so I was only able to book 72 hours in advance. The cheaper of the two economy cabins had sold out on all 3 flights. The flexible ticket cost about 3 times the advertised minimum fare. Despite this I was charged 8 euros for paying with a credit card (none of my debit cards were accepted by the airline's web site). The ticket allowed fast track security although as this lane was merged into others there was no advantage. Extra cabin baggage was also allowed but as the ground staff did not enforce the cabin baggage policy this was again no advantage. The flight left 20 minutes late as the handling agent had not loaded the bags in time. The seat had no head rest and felt like it had almost no padding a bit like resting on a leather covered ironing board. There was no magazine in the seat pocket. The advertised free light meal/snack was a bread roll with two slices of cheese with terrible coffee served in a small paper cup.

The food was great but the attitude to my issue by the flight crew made me have a very displeased view of the airline. I got to my destination and my baggage was nowhere to be found misinformation by their Nairobi office made me make two unnecessary trips to the Airport and finally after 5 days I got my belongings. My intention for this trip had been delayed for that time and needless to say I could not make it back as planned since I had to finish the business that took me there. The Airline refused to reschedule me on another flight as they were booked but had a seat for the full price if I did not want to wait another week to get a rescheduled flight with minimum penalty.

Only let-down was the in-flight entertainment. It's a modern on-demand system with a nice big touch screen and useful USB port but choice of movies and music was poor and the flight map function too clever for its own good - it seemed to endlessly show places hundreds of miles away with silly captions like 'historical city of Venice' and only occasionally made it clear where you actually are!,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,True,

At 12.30 no plane and announced a departure at 12.50 but at 12.50 still no plane. After a while we found out our plane landed in Pisa. Information was limited and unclear. At 14.30 we were bussed from Florence to Pisa (where we had to go through security once again). In Pisa our flight was not on the board but after a while we were called to the gate and finally took off at 16.20. Pilot excused for the delay and said he had to land in Pisa due to bad weather above Florence and he only had for 15 minutes spare fuel. I heard about limited fuel amounts with low cost carriers but prices at Brussels Airlines are all except low cost. As compensation for the almost 4 hour delay we were offered as compensation one free coffee tea water or soft drink! We were handed a menu as if we wanted some food we could buy this from the menu.

I called the main Brussels Air # and the automated message said that it was on-time so we continued toward the airport. I decided to call back and talk to a person who said that yes it was canceled due to a mechanical fault and the plane had never left Brussels for the US. Thus when I called about the seats the airline already knew there was no plane but the agent who confirmed my seats didn't.

Despite a late change of gate flight took off almost on time and was pretty uneventful. The A319 makes a nice change from the Avro 100s. Service was pretty perfunctory from the usual Brussels Airlines older hostesses who whilst being professional showed little real interest in passengers - and certainly not those in B lite economy!

From both noon or afternoon departures they changed to the first morning flights which was after 6 am from Prague for example.

Single seats in row 1 are best as you get the most room for your legs. IFE was pretty good. Food wise I ordered a special meal (Lacto-ovo vegetarian). Surprisingly the catering was better out of JFK. Lovely mozzarella pearl salad with tomatoes and cheese ravioli among other things plus a beautiful fruit plate and various cheeses for dessert. Standard breakfast tray with a warm croissant and yoghurt etc was simple and tasty. Catering out of BRU was disappointing. Served a vegan meal which did not suit my needs. Despite efforts to find alternatives the only thing that could be found was fruit. I was given an unopened bottle of champagne to take with me and was urged to complain which yielded 2000 miles.

Brussels Airlines customer review,8,2012-12-31,BRU-NYC in Economy. Very nice experience over all. Check in and pre-boarding a bit confused but ok. Seat pitch very nice for economy and being quite tall really a plus. Cocktails and snacks served after take off followed by a quite good meal for economy. Followed by coffee and the and ice-cream. They could have come through the cabin with water more often and in general the cabin service was correct but somewhat reserved.

When it became clear that our flight wasn't going anywhere we were bussed to a very nice hotel for an overnight stay and given dinner and breakfast. The flight took off the next morning without delay. The service was first rate and they even gave us chilled champagne in economy class!

My husband and I (and 8 month twin babies) traveled from New York to Hamburg via Brussels for 3 hours. We felt un-rushed between flights during our layover and onboard.

Brussels Airlines customer review,7,2012-10-11,Booked trip PRG-SXB via BRU return short connection (1 hr) confirmed as sufficient. Web check reminder came exactly 24 hrs before flight by e-mail. First leg delayed by technical reasons for about 30 mins. RJ100 not very clean sunshield broken. Upon my request the crew denied to arrange any fast transfer to connecting flight (hand baggage only). Despite the staff attitude and thanks to the same gate concourse in BRU I have just made the boarding. Second leg operated by Flybe crew but SN plane (Dash 8 Q400) only 20 pax on board small snack provided (opposite to the first leg). On return I tried successfully mobile webckeck but no one was able to answer in advance whether this will be accepted by the Strasbourg airport - I was recommended to check-in at the SXB though but on the spot was informed this is alright. Some 1 hour before departure it was clear that flight to BRU is delayed. I just managed to check Brussels airport website to find out that expected delay will result in missing the 1 hr connection to Prague (and having night in BRU and morning flight to PRG on the SN costs naturally). Immediately I received call from SN booking center with offer of replacement direct flight by CSA taking me home 2 hrs sooner than original schedule without additional charges and swiftly received new e-ticket and proceeded to check-in. Therefore despite not being in the same alliance as CSA SN has made great service on the return and will not hesitate to fly with them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,10,2012-10-08,NCE-BRU-NCE. Check-in efficient. A little delay due to a technical problem and a lost passenger inside the Nice Terminal. Economy seating quite spacious in an A319 and surprising amount of legroom. Food and drinks are for purchase however the choice offered and the quality proposed is largely worth the expense. Flight arrived with a 20 minute delay however the disembarking process went on quickly. As always at BRU bags tend to take some time to arrive but the labyrinth that gets you there does somehow reduce the sense of wait. Return flight even better. Same quality service as outbound without the delay in an A320. Worth both your money and your time.

The flights were wonderful - punctual check-in and boarding times excellent service from friendly staff very good beverage and food service. The entertainment on the flight New York to Brussels was great - each seat has their own screen and a good selection of films audio or games to choose from. On the flight Brussels to Bilbao (about 2 hours) we were served beverages and a warm meal. That just doesn't happen anymore on flights within the United States so it was a welcome surprise.

Brussels Airlines customer review,8,2012-06-06,TXL-BRU-BJL-BRU-TXL. European flights in b.flex intercontinental ones in business class. Since I last flew Brussels Airlines in b.flex there has been a significant decline in service. A year ago you received a little tray with a salad a cold meal and hot bread rolls. Now it is down to a sandwich or a croissant depending on the time of day. European business class seemed to be down-graded too. In business you get now what you used to get in b.flex. Intercontinental flights in business class however were quite a different matter. On the way out to Banjul the plane was equipped with the new business-class seats. In one row the seating arrangement is 1-2-1 in the next 2-1-2. Beds are fully lie-flat beds now. Meals were of an excellent quality for airline food and flight attendants were attentive and constantly refilled your glasses. On the return to Brussels the cabin layout in business class was the old 2-2-2 seating so no lie-flat beds which was a pity as it was a night flight departing at 22.45 local time. Service was a bit rushed but then everyone was eager to get at least a couple of hours of sleep before breakfast was served at 5.45 CET.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,6,2012-05-21,BRU-MAD-BRU in b.light. Both flights on-time with friendly crew. Remarkable only a 2-minute wait for luggage in Madrid.

Brussels Airlines customer review,8,2012-05-02,LYS-BRU-LHR first flight on Avro RJ100 second on Avro RJ85. Good flight though 2nd a little late due to aircraft late arrival. Both crews professional and friendly with interesting en-route information in 3 languages. Food and drinks prices correct despite limited choice. Good value but long transit in Brussels (4 hours). Luggage delivered quickly in LHR. Bus shuttle from aircraft to terminal in LHR unfortunately adds to the delay and no remarks from crew to the passenger in front of me who didn't put his seat in the upright position on landing apart from that a smooth flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,

Brussels Airlines is really a low cost airline ""dressed-up"" as a major. Not a single cup of water offered onboard.

Brussels Airlines customer review,7,2012-04-11,BRU-Toulouse-BRU in B Flex economy +. Both flights on time on the very old Avro 100s. Whilst glad to report that the Brussels Airlines crew still offer a fairly professional service the B Flex product is hardly attractive - a free drink and a 'snack' - a small packet of Doritos! A newspaper if you are lucky but no extra legroom. Best to buy a B light ticket and purchase drinks/food. Sadly I rarely use Brussels Airlines these days due to the unrealistic economy fares they offer on my regular routes and competition from the likes of Easyjet and Ryanair.

Brussels Airlines customer review,8,2012-03-09,NCL-BRU-AGP-BRU-NCL in b-light (discount economy). Newcastle-Brussels sectors operated by BMI regional. Check-in online 24 hours before no queue for drop off. Outbound FA fairly surly but extremely bright and cheery on return. Coffee and waffle perfectly adequate. Fairly long trek at Brussels from non-Schengen to Schengen gates although little in the way of queues. Aircraft substitution and baggage reconciliation issues meant a fairly farcical situation at gate several duplicate seat assignments added to confusion although onboard crew were extremely efficient and apologetic. Ageing 737 into Malaga not particularly comfortable. Return on newer A319 with new slimline seats and all on time. Catering on BRU-AGP sectors was BoB which was fairly expensive. Overall very good service for the price and will certainly consider using SN again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,9,2012-02-27,Early-morning Geneva-Brussels flight on A319. Comfortable slim line leather seats. Efficient and professional cabin crew.

Outbound flight on a freezing Avro RJ100 - even the FA's had to wear coats in the cold cabin until the temperature rose to an acceptable level some time after takeoff. No complimentary service in b.light but that doesn't matter on a 1.5 hr flight especially when prices for snacks/drinks are quite reasonable.

Brussels Airlines customer review,3,2012-02-13,Brussels to Dakar. On the outbound flight we only learned upon entering the lounge that this flight would not be operated by Brussels but by HiFly!

Brussels Airlines customer review,8,2012-01-27,I fly BRS-BRU by Brussels Airlines (actually operated by BMI Regional) 3 or 4 times a year. The flights are good; punctuality excellent efficient online check-in comfortable seats and crew efficient. Frankly though they should be as the standard fare (BFlex) is over £600 for two one-hour flights. They claim a cheaper BLight fare exists but even booking 6 or 8 weeks in advance it never seems to be available. To add insult to injury after paying £600+ you are charged £5 to use a credit card that is just extortion. Premium fares and low-cost money grabbing tactics do not go well together.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,7,2012-01-18,One of the main problems of this airline is the inconsistency of its product. The fleet has been modernized in the last two or three years but they still dispose of many ancient B737s and Avros. Seat pitch is better than with many competitors but broken seats can be found much too often. FA's sometimes are overwhelmingly friendly but as a rule they are uninterested and rude. My last flight BRU-TXL-BRU was quite typical: Outbound flight on a relatively new A319 extremely unfriendly chief purser other FA's indifferent. Inbound on an old Avro but FAs very friendly. Unusually cordial welcome (and farewell) by the Captain and we arrived half an hour early. All bets are off with this airline - expect the best and the worst.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,3,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,8,2012-01-18,LHR-BRU return in B. Economy flex. On Airbus A319 and Avro RJ85. Economy flex is essentially economy class on a flexible ticket but has a few advantages. Fast track security is available at both Heathrow Terminal 1 and Brussels which is helpful at peak times. Seating is allocated with an empty middle seat if available which it was on both flights making it similar to business in that sense. Onboard there is complementary food - in the morning a rather bland cheese roll and a pain au chocolat in the afternoon it was two sandwiches and a cake. Still drinks included complementary wine and beer which is welcome. Overall reasonable for what is essentially a 50 minute flight with time built into the schedule to take into account expected delays at Heathrow. Competitively priced with BA on same route and the fully flexible Eurostar fares.,False,,,Premium Economy,,,4,4,,,3,,True,

Brussels Airlines customer review,5,2012-01-01,Flew Manchester to Brussels at 06.30 in economy class for business during the cold and snowy 2010 winter. I was expecting delays but check-in staff at the boarding gate had no information as to when the flight would be ready to depart. When finally on the Avro RJ85 aircraft we had to wait for the plane to be defrosted for over 45 mins and then we were put to the end of the queue for take-off. Flight attendants were ignorant and inattentive. Bad flight maybe due to the earliness of the flight and the bad weather. I do however stay loyal to Brussels Airlines due to their great brand image and other reviews.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,3,2011-12-29,BRU-MAD. Booked two months in advance yet still relatively expensive compared to Iberia. Therefore expected a better onboard product which was a big mistake. No entertainment not even a newspaper food and drinks had to be paid for even for a glass of water.

Roomier than most airlines even in economy class but no individual inflight entertainment console just one for the whole area and no choice of movie etc. Food was good nice and hot and a good selection despite it being a diabetic meal. Breakfast was also good. Staff were friendly and helpful but check-in staff at Nairobi were not fantastic and gave me the wrong information about check-in time so I was left standing at the desk for 2 hours.

Aircraft was a 737-400 getting rather long in the tooth nowadays the seating cramped seemed more so than the A320s and Avro regional jets SN Brussels have in their fleet. The flight departed on time with good information from the flight deck.

Brussels Airlines customer review,2,2011-07-10,BCN-BRU Business Class. At the check-in gate they had merged the 2 fast bag drop counters and Business Class together. This was frustrating as most people check-in online these days so I had to wait a good 10 mins despite being a Business Class customer. At the check-in the airline had moved another passenger to their seat preference which resulted in my partner and I not being sat together despite the same Business Class booking. Once on board the old B737 was rather dated and there was no separation between Business and Economy. It felt like being on a Ryanair flight with a clear view down to the back of the plane. The only sign of separation was a small label a few seats back which said B.Flex class (Economy) starts here. The seats were standard Economy in 3x3 configuration. There was no attempt to at least relocate the armrests to use up the middle seat and provide a wider seat. The legroom was decent but it still felt tight. The cabin crew were polite and attentive and made up a bit for the disappointing check-in service and seating. Arrival into Brussels was fine. Though we had to wait about 10-15 mins for out bags to arrive after the first bag appeared on the carousel. This was once again frustrating as Business Class bags should get higher priority and were labelled with this sticker in Barcelona airport. I wouldn't recommend flying with Brussels airlines in Business Class (at least on short-haul). This is clearly not an area of focus for them and would save money and fly in Economy.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,False,

After complaining to United I found out that Brussels refused to credit the miles to me saying that the flight ""is not a valid route."" Apparently Brussels claims that they do not fly to Lome. The flight was operated with their plane their crew. They clearly fly to Lome. They should be ejected from Star Alliance.",False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,8,2011-05-22,Brussels to Geneva A319 economy class not much legroom but the empty seat beside me was a bonus. You have to pay for food / drinks but that is the case with many other non low-cost airlines too in economy class (such as Iberia / Aer Lingus etc). Staff were pleasant enough flight landed on time. Return flight from Geneva was in a newer A320 with more leg room. Again the staff were pleasant and flight departed on time and landed ahead of schedule.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,3,2011-05-11,Low Cost Service at full cost prices. Brussels Airlines charge you 4 Euro for a Muffin and they are quite rude at checkin and obsessed with their baggage weights. If I would like to fly Easyjet than I also would like to pay their price. But Easyjet service at Lufthansa prices? This is ridiculous.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,7,2011-05-02,FCO-BRU-FCO clean refurbished 737 kind crew. Competitive fare (93 Euros return) compared to Alitalia but no snack offered and poor legroom low-cost style.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,6,2011-03-09,GVA-BRU-MAN. On time service from Geneva short 1h flight with nothing distinguishing. Pleasant FA's. Disappointed by the lack of onboard service considering it is not a low cost carrier and fare wasn't cheapest. Departure from Brussels slightly early on empty Avro RJ plane quick and easy arrival into Manchester. Overall an average experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,9,2011-03-04,CPH-BRU-Bujumbura. Excellent trip lots of space. Long haul new aircraft quite noisy cabin clean staff professional a bit rigid and no smile were noticed. Servings fairly frequent enough drinks. Serve even a good sparkling wine on economy class but only on day-flights. Food exceptionally good special request met to perfection. Good information from captain. Economy flex tickets do not provide additional benefits on board - there is just one monkey class on the long haul. Airline seems now to have finally decided to become a full service carrier and have dropped discount modality.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,9,2011-03-04,CPH-BRU-AGP in b.flex economy+. CPH-BRU excellent leg space and inflight meal complimentary bar service. BRU-AGP on B737-400 very tired interior but warm meal with full bar service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,7,2011-02-18,Brussels-Vilnius return clean Avro with decent seating. Flew B-Flex this time and offered a nice warm meal. Crew professional and language skills excellent. On Brussels Airlines you get what you pay for: B-Flex offers economy class with some extra perks (fast lane) B-Light are the cheaper fares. In B-Light you can buy drinks and snacks on board.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,7,2011-02-15,Brussels-Porto. B-light economy ticket for 100 euro return. Online check-in crashed but I got my seat (emergency exit). The plane was half-empty so nobody on seats next to me. Good flight but pity you have to pay extra for food or drinks. Strangely enough my Etihad Guest card was not accepted.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,1,2011-02-14,The flight to Zurich costs over €1200 in economy - a destination once served by Virgin Express for less than €100 return! This disgrace compounded with the fact that the Brussels Airlines plane is a very cramped old dirty plane!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,5,2011-02-01,BRU-TLV. Service ok plane on time but Brussels Airlines operates A319 on this route. This is a very cramped plane seat with small pitch and hard cushion. Almost impossible to sleep on this night flight. Business seat is a joke - at least fare was competitive.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,,2011-01-14,Brussels to Philadelphia on Christmas eve or at least we tried. Brussels Airlines was supposed to get us to London so we could get our connection with US Airways. Due to weather conditions flight got cancelled. I am not complaining about the cancellation weather conditions are beyond anyone's control however I am complaining about the lack of information and help given to us from this point on. We were rebooked re-cancelled they lost our luggage on the way and there is no way to get through to their luggage tracing department they just do not answer any calls! When you send an email to their Baggage department you do not get an answer either let alone an automated message saying they received your mail! It does not stop there. Brussels Airlines changed my return flight to London with US Airways without consulting me and decided to change it to return to Brussels even though I live in London. I still to this day do not know why! They had to add a flight to my itinerary so I could get home to London. To this day I still do not have my luggage and have not been contacted once. My emails and calls remain unanswered. I have never had to face such problems in all my previous travels with any airlines.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,3,2010-12-31,Brussels to Bilbao on 25 December. No delays were indicated on the website nor at check-in. But when departure time arrived things got wrong. A 1 hour delay was announced. After a while change of gate and an airplane was there but no crew! On Xmas day there was not much traffic and runways were active. Some passenger had been going to the airport for the 3rd consecutive day due to cancellation linked to snow. A new 1 hour delay was announced with no clear indication that the flight would leave. There were children old people and a pregnant woman. We had to pressure and harrass the airline agents to get food vouchers as legislation provides for. Eventually we left with a 3 hour delay. Information was non0-existant. Flying with Brussels Airlines is a poor experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,3,2010-12-17,MXP-BRU. Very average at best. We were 45 minutes late leaving due to weather (ice) at MXP and will give them credit for the updates. Of course all had connections and this created havoc on the plane with questions from many passengers. Will say the Purser handled this with dignity and answered all with a good attitude. Surprised at the amount and size of carry on baggage that was allowed. This was a smaller plane and noticed many oversized pieces that were not able to fit any where. Many people had piled their pieces on empty seats and left them there. Nothing said by crew. No inflight service at all in my section. They did get me there and transferred my luggage so happy about that.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,2,2010-12-16,LHR-Bujumbura. Overall a very poor experience. Service and facilities on the ground in Brussels were very poor. I had to queue at the Brussels Airlines desk for an hour to get a boarding card whilst the sole employee dealt very slowly with the 2 or 3 people in front of me. On the flight seats were uncomfortable with limited leg room and very little recline. The inflight entertainment was near non-existent - at least the screen was so far away that it was impossible to watch. Food was average.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,4,2010-11-16,BRU-LFW/ACC-BRU. Mixed experience overall and not up to what I would expect. Online check-in did not work for either leg. Boarding in Brussels well organized in Accra was complete chaos with the airport trying to board three different flights through the same gate at roughly the same time. No information screens or announcements people milling around and gate agents shouting instructions but only managing to add to the confusion. The aircraft interiors were old with no PTVs and just a single screen at the front of each cabin. The food on the flight to Lome was horrible - worse than US-based airlines. The food on the flight back to Brussels was much better. Cabin crew were also variable with a few trying hard while others were disengaged and uninterested. But since the fare was the cheapest by far I got good value for my money overall.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,2,2010-08-19,Business Class seats are very average no flat bed position and not very comfortable if you happen to be tall. During our outward bound flight my seat (03C) malfunctioned and became immovable. I brought this to the attention of the crew and without apology was rudely informed that I should choose another vacant seat for the remainder of the flight. I found this unacceptable as there were no free seats accessible for myself and my wife to sit together. Eventually after complaining once more a member of the crew was able to correct the problem by resetting the mechanical unit under the chair. I would also add that the screen in front of my seat was also faulty cabin was dirty and the quality of the food was well below Business Class standard. On our return flight to Kigali before taking off we noticed that both our seats were malfunctioning and once again advised the flight crew. A member of the ground technical staff was called on board and together with the cabin crew attempted to repair the seats without success. At this stage we were politely asked if we would mind moving to the free seats one row behind. We complied with the request only to find that these seats (4A & 4C) were likewise not operational and were finally relocated to 4H & 4K. The crew on this flight were attentive apologetic and informed us that the problems with seats in Business Class are recurrent and assured us that a report would be filed. I personally bore the expense of upgrading our tickets to Business Class in order to enjoy a more comfortable and relaxed journey. Unfortunately this was not the case as we were troubled by the overall poor condition of the aircraft cabin and casual disregard for the comfort and safety of passengers by Brussels Airlines.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,8,2010-08-19,Even though I had a low-cost ticket I enjoyed nice service in the old Sabena style on a flight BRU-Nice in A319. I was lucky to book two exit-row seats using online check in so plenty of space. Did not use the meal or drink service. Four stars not five.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,5,2010-08-03,B-Flex (the Premium Eco) can be a good deal but be very careful never to take a codeshare flight. I did it with a flight to Lisbon using TAP and I must say that the website of Brussels Airlines is very misleading you would need a magnifier to note that this is a codeshare flight. As a consequence you are denied any of the B-Flex perks: staff at Brussels Airlines check-in does not even recognize you and send you to make the full queue at TAP check-in. You receive no fast track at the security. You receive no preferred seating no snack not even a drink. You are basically a simple economy passenger stupid enough to have paid a B-Flex fee instead of the cheapest economy fare. I got the Brussels Airlines flight on my return and then had nothing to complain I received all the perks and was quite happy of the flight. In my view the Brussels Airlines website is totally dishonest as even their confirmation told me about those perks I was not going to receive on the TAP flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,9,2010-07-11,Flew NCE-BRU and BRU-NCE b economy flex. Good onboard service with free coffee drinks and snacks Brussels Airport convenient and easy to use. All this with a low ticket price. A good choice also if you want to connect to Africa cheaply.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,7,2010-06-23,BRS-BRU return (twice). These flights are operated by bmi aircraft and crews. All flights on time or a little early. Embraer aircraft are a fairly small but I like them particularly if they are not full (only one of these four flights was nearly full); they are light smooth and the leg room is fine for a short flight. My one complaint is the price one of my trips was economy (B.Light) and the other economy plus (B.Light+). Although the latter was over twice the price (and even economy is not particularly cheap) there was virtually no difference in the quality of service - a bit more food and that is it. I believe the hand luggage weight limit is a bit higher but if you check-in online nobody knows. So my advice is buy the cheapest ticket; though as previous commentators have said that is not always possible.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,5,2010-06-17,BRU-NCL-BRU in 'b.light economy'. Booked tickets through their website and as usual the cheaper fares were sold out so ended up booking a rather expensive ticket. I used the online check in to Newcastle but when trying to check in online for the return flight to Brussels I got a message 'pick up boarding pass at airport' meaning I had to be even more early at Newcastle airport for the 6.25 morning flight. A positive point is flights between Brussels and Newcastle are operated for Brussels Airlines by BMI who fly Embraers on the route. These may not be the most comfortable planes but a lot better than the outdated AVRO's Brussels Airlines used for this route.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,,2010-06-13,"Travelled two days ago with an elderly disabled friend from Oslo to Brussels. The plane was twenty minutes late taking off - which was worrying as we had a short time connecting flight to catch in Brussels. To be fair Brussels Airlines put us in a car and dropped us ""near"" - their words - to the security check in. In reality it took twenty minutes to navigate through the confusing Brussels Airport and the extremely arrogant Belgian security staff. We just made our connecting flight in time. My disabled companion was extremely stressed and needed his heart medicine more than once.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,8,2010-06-13,Brussels to Entebbe via Kigali in business class. Seats standard business no possibility to lie flat and primitive video system (no VOD). Service excellent attentive sufficient number of attendants food extremely good. Wine list small but high quality wines in all a very nice trip.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,8,2010-05-31,BRU-LHR.Checked in online and walked straight to the gate. The bus driver didn't seem to know where the RJ100 was parked and drove us around almost every corner of the airport. The suitcase (even though it is within cabin luggage size limits) does not fit in the AVRO overhead lockers. Typically FA's place it in the front of the plane and hand it over when leaving the aircraft. Last week the flight to LHR was delayed by more than one hour There was no food no coffee no tea due to a strike at the catering company. When leaving the aircraft I asked for my luggage and was told to get it on the conveyor. After passing the IRIS scan instead of passport control (which is a real time saver in London) I could wait for over 30 minutes to receive my cabin luggage back. Usually SN Brussels Airlines has a very good staff and service but this time a was slightly disappointed.,False,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,9,2010-05-25,NCL-BRU in Economy Flex. The small embraer plane is operated by BMI Regional. Very punctual service only one cabin crew each way but they were excellent. The food was good. My only gripe was that I wished I'd flown Economy and saved money. The seat is exactly the same as is the leg oom. In reality the extra money (which was considerable) is really for a newspaper a couple of drinks and a cold meal. If you are on a flight for less than two hours then I would recommend economy.,False,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,1,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,8,2010-05-11,CPHBRU-BRS return in economy classflights on time. Cabin staff very service minded and helpful. Seat pitch more than adequate. Even though I had to pay for drinks and snacks the prices were OK food fresh and a good selection of Belgian beer. There's also diabtec friendly food and a vegetarian option. Only moment of irritation was transfer at BRU which when transferring from Schengen to Non-Schengen requires at least 25 mins of walking.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,10,2010-04-21,ATH to BRU in B-flex. ot stuck in ATH with so many others due to the volcano eruption - very well taken care of. Brussels Airlines arranged accomodation for us very well informed and promptly rebooked and sent home as soon as operations resumed. Very nice cabin crews in both directions.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,7,2010-04-20,MAD-BRU-NBO return with my Miles & More miles. Short haul flights on old 737s but cabins were clean and decent. We were on b-flex economy so were offered a meal which was nice. Long haul on A330-300 with nice pitch but no IFE which would have made a big difference and ok meals. Cabin crews very good except for NBO-BRU where more veteran FAs not so nice. Overall a reliable airline with acceptable service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,8,2010-04-06,Brussels to Berlin in b-light and back in b-flex. Clean and comfortable Avro's with good legroom and wide seats (only 5 seats in a row). Crew friendly and with good language skills. Food in b-flex nothing to write home about but drinks of good quality and plentifull. Check- in in Brussels quick and easy thanks to my silver status with Miles and More. Completely other story at check-in in Berlin. One attendant only arrived two hours before departure and as there was only one row nobody cared about priority check-in for premium passengers. Unacceptable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,4,2010-03-28,BRU-GVA-BRU in b.light. Outbound flight on nearly full Avro RJ 100. Only two FA's but very friendly service. Flight arrived on time. Return flight on ageing B737-300. Departure delayed due to late arrival of aircraft and further delays due to heavy traffic at GVA. Arrived in BRU one hour late. Only three FA's on this full evening flight very poor service. Maybe not if you were in business or b.flex (one third of all passengers). Sales of drinks and snacks in b.light by just one FA (what were the others up to?) started just two minutes before descent into BRU. Very rushed service as a result. Service in general mostly non-existant unfriendly and disinterested. Simply not good enough given the fact the return fare was EUR 250. Taped announcements very annoying. Live announcements in Dutch virtually incomprehensible.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,8,2010-03-17,I fly regularly between Porto and Gothenburg via Brussels with Brussels Airlines. The time table suits me the way you are treated is very good cabins are clean and comfortable and as far as service is concerned you get what you pay for. And the prices are very good compared with other options I have.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,2,2010-03-10,Problem of Brussels Airline is that they have to decide if they are a low cost or a standard airline. Low cost prices are not so low but if you are travelling at full price you are served like a low cost airline this applies in particular for ground services in the airport: long queues bad info personnel not trained to handle unexpected events such delays or cancellations and very few people at the help desks. Before from Brussels there was the choice between SN Brussels and Virgin Express both company were delivering good value for money - when they merged together they took the worst of both airlines and put it on the same plane!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,2,2010-03-07,The biggest problem of Brussels Airlines is that in a mostly small Avroliner cabin three classes are done. Passengers in business do not even have the privacy of a curtain. In business a very cheap champagne is offered. The meal service in so called B flex is usually rather poor - a company that started very good after the Sabena disaster as SN Brussels even offering hot croissants in economy now approach the level of a cheap carrier.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,9,2010-02-20,GVA-BRU-GVA on Brussels Airlines in B.Flex cabin. Airplane old 737-400 going to BRU and a B737-300 on the way back. Airplanes were showing their age but are ok. Seat pitch was ok in B.Flex class. Service was very good with a good snack full beverage service. Cabin crew were nice and multiligual. B.Flex product is very good - almost the same level as some other airlines business class. You can't access lounge for free but you are allowed to use fast lane at security at Brussels which is very good.,False,,,Premium Economy,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,,2010-01-19,Had a B-Flex with Brussels Airlines. Plane was delayed 5 Hours because of snowfall in Sweden so we missed our connection flight. Our onward ticket with a 5-star airline got rebooked to a low cost airline (economy) with non-existent service. Also we had to pay for hotel 1 night in Brussels that Brussels Airline refused to pay. I cannot recommend this airline to anyone.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,,2009-12-20,My wife and two kids left from Kinshasa to Toulouse via Brussels. The plane had three hours delay on arrival in Brussels and they missed the connecting flight. The next flights were full one was cancelled the last flight at night again did not take off. They refused hotel or any support claiming always there would soon be a flight. They slept on the floor in the airport. The next day same story no assistance no help - flights leaving to Toulouse booked out. She left finally at 6pm a delay of 36 hours in which no assistance or help whatsoever was given to them. Brussels should be ashamed their service is non existent.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,6,2009-12-05,BRU-OSL in economy class. Check in on-line and printed my boarding pass before arrival at the airport. Luggage drop off at a designated counter was quick and hustle free. Flight was on time. Staff friendly and helpful. Food available for purchase on board. Overall experience was quite positive except for a loud noise made by an old Avro RJ100 engines during the entire flight. If booked in advanced fares are normally affordable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,3,2009-11-30,LIS-BRU. Brussels airlines is downgrading its product which is becoming low cost with old and tired 737s from former Virgin express with very cramped seats and one of the worse pitch. Inbound flight with TAP and you could size difference for seat comfort and overall package. Will try avoiding this company when possible until fleet is upgraded and they become more competitive. .,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Brussels Airlines customer review,7,2009-11-15,Brussels-Venice return. Worth noting that in theory BLight pax have less cabin baggage allowance than BFLEX and only the overhead lockers down to row 4/5 are large enough to hold a standard carry-on suitcase. So get on early and grab one of these lockers! Online check-in is a real bonus when flying at the crack of dawn. It meant I could take the first airport bus arriving at 05.35 go straight to security and arrive at gate A71 (somewhere near Mechelen) before loading started.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,8,2009-11-12,Tel Aviv to Brussels and on to Barcelona and back. All flights were on time - three on A319s and the other an Avro. Service polite friendly and efficient. Meals and refreshments were free and fine on longer legs. No videos or music was available. Price was keenest of all airlines on the dates travelled. All in all a good package with nothing meaningful to complain about.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,8,2009-10-21,CPH-BRU-CTA return in b.business. Champagne on boarding Cold meal CPH-BRU-CPH - and warm lunch BRU-CTA-BRU. Huge difference between service and attitude of crew which gave me an inconsistent impression. Satisfying experience - food was really good.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Brussels Airlines customer review,5,2009-09-23,Brussels to Budapest B-Flex: seems the additional cost of B-Flex compared to B-Light is worth when you fly on a B737 as you have a probability to get the seat next to you free. However if you fly the Avro the flight is almost always full and you are in exactly the same cramped seats and suffer lack of hand luggage storage space like B-Light - so you pay much money for the privilege of a regular food tray and apple juice. I had to fly with my handbag under my feet and it was far from comfortable. SN Airlines is basically a no frills airline but to be fair they have good schedules and are timely.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
