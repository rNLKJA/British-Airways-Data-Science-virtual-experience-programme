I approached one of the Jazeera ground staff in Amman, who assured me the airline is aware there is a delay and of the connecting flight to Doha, and once I arrive in Kuwait, they will transfer me to the next available flight to Doha on any airline because they have newly made agreements with other airlines to ensure passengers get to their in a timely manner, as this has been happening regularly with the airline. So when I arrived to Kuwait airport, no one knew of my issue, the transit desk told me someone from Jazeera has to give them authority to do anything and they kept calling a ground staff member, but the phones were off, they directed me to the gate where the ground staff would be, when I went there, no one had a clue and redirected me back to the transit desk.
