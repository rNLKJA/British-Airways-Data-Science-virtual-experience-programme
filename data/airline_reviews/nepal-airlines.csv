First, I received that the flight had been delayed from 11 am to 4 pm by e-mail with only 12 hours I’m advance. As soon I received the e-mail, I call Nepal airlines office in airport because with the new schedule I would miss my second flight. In every call a different phone-extension was given. After my seventh call, I was advised to go to the airport because they could resolve my problem personally. In the airport, I was told to wait for someone, that had never appeared. I went to the police, that put me in (in Nepal airport, you have to have a ticket to get in). There, I was received with rudeness and unprofessionally by every Nepal airlines employees. For instance, I was told that I wasn’t allowed to be there and I was going to be kick out of the airport. Once again, I was told to be in the airport in the next morning because it was their responsibility to resolve my problem. Next morning, I was once again received with rudeness and unprofessionally. No one ever apologized for the inconvenience neither assumed the responsibility. Instead they only gave us one option going to the hotel. After getting upset, they started giving me other options, such us other companies flights and get into city center office. However, everything was fake. Never had been a option of flying with other company when I questioned them. Never had been a option to go to Kathmandu when I confronted them. At the end, I fly with Nepal airlines not even in 4 pm, but 7pm and I missed my connection flight. It was outrageous how an international airlines have dealt with their customers.
