The other issue is that in prior flights on CRJ 900s, I have always been able to stow a rollaboard, which can be easily stowed above the seats the right side of this aircraft. When I asked this attendant why the policy had changed, she was rather impertinent stating that this had always been the policy by law (i.e. the need to check rollaboards). You can check your records to see how often I have flown this route from either SRQ to Charlotte or DCA and I was always allowed to bring a bag on board. I sense that my question, which was very diplomatically phrased, was not appreciated and led to the rest of our less than satisfactory interaction.

"""a vast contrast""",1,2016-06-01,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew American Eagle from Columbus to New York. There is a vast contrast between flying American Airlines mainline and American Eagle. American Eagle (AE) is to be avoided if you have any other option, especially if your route uses one of their old embraer or bombardier planes that insist on gate checking roll on bags, CRJ700, ERJ140 and ERJ145. American Airlines mainline are my airline of choice especially when flying internationally. I fly AE in and out of Columbus frequently to connect with the AA mainline international flights. I used to book Delta Connect (DC) flights on separate tickets to avoid AE but the DC schedules changed making that option impractical. As examples, with AE you have a 50/50 chance of arriving in Columbus and having to wait a couple of hundred yards back from the gate for about 10 minutes until the below wing ground handlers saunter out of their break room to marshall the aircraft onto stand. You can then wait an average of 15-20 minutes to have your gate checked bag delivered back to the jet bridge. DC normally do this in under 3 minutes for the same aircraft type. If you hold check a bag you better allow yourself a full 45 minutes before it will be delivered on the carousel. With any weather disruptions anywhere in the AA network they will delay and cancel the AE flights, especially the flights in and out of their 2nd tier bases, to the benefit of the mainline and hub flights. Then you will get a shrug of the shoulders from their staff and a statement that because it is weather related the airline bears no responsibility for any delays etc.. You will have about a 20% chance of a maintenance issue on any given flight with this older fleet.

This makes embarking and disembarking much quicker. The full flight loaded in 15 minutes and left on time. Beware though, smaller plane means smaller overhead luggage bins, which means carry ons that fit easily in a 737 for example, might be a tight squeeze on this plane. I slept on the flight and missed service. There is no on board entertainment on these planes, just wifi which I did not connect to.

American Eagle customer review,,2014-08-11,For the past two years I've been flying American Eagle several times a month between St. Louis and Washington DC (DCA) and the service has steadily declined in quality and reliability. At least half of the flights are late (some several hours) and a number have been cancelled (including several evening flights requiring an overnight stay at my expense). I've tolerated this mediocre service because of convenience (and a distaste for Southwest) but yesterday upon landing at DCA the new gate arrangement has pushed me to Southwest. Now instead of boarding/deplaning at a terminal gate the aircraft parks away from the terminal and passengers are transported to the terminal - a process that takes 20-30 minute (not to mention the hassle of standing outside the aircraft on the tarmac waiting for carry-on luggage).

They did not ask if anyone on flight was willing to take a later flight. Just stated we were selected but not told how selection process works. Don't understand why they waited until we were ready to board. Had we been told 30 min earlier we could have caught another flight that day. They would not remove our luggage or anyone elses to make weight. We were put on a flight the next day and had a layover (purchased flight was direct) arrived at final destination a day late and very grumpy. Our luggage did make it a day earlier.

The ticket agent supervisor very unfriendly and showed no care at all of what we were going through. They did put passengers in hotels but I have family in the area. Next morning the 7.30 am flight delayed because we were told via loudspeaker by the ticket agent on duty that 'someone fell down on the job' and didn't book a crew for the right time.

American Eagle customer review,7,2013-04-01,DCA-JFK-DCA CRJ 700. High marks for operating on a forecast heavy snow day when many other airlines cancelled. Weather turned out to be fairly mild at both DCA and JFK that day. This is commuter regional service and works well only for a flight of no longer than 1.5 hours each way (approx. 250 miles). I connected at JFK to a Cathay Pacific international flight. CRJ 700 aircraft on both segments were quite new very quiet clean and reasonably comfortable in First Class. Yet the so-called First Class seat offers nothing with no leg rest or entertainment system. All standard carry-on bags must be valet checked and causes delays at the destination especially if connecting quickly to another flight. A beverage was served and a small bag of trail mix was given outbound but only given to me on the inbound flight because I asked. American Eagle gate counters tend to be a bit chaotic especially at JFK as several flights board from the same gate entrance. Both flights were on time the flight attendants were reasonably friendly and my checked luggage delivered without too much delay. Overall this is the most basic way to connect by air (even in so-called First Class) between two airports that are about 250 miles apart.

Next flight to LEX was 6 hours later and was sold out - next possible seats were 9 hours later. American did agree to let us travel to Louisville (SDF) instead but had to rent a car with a hefty drop charge. Finally arrived in Lexington 3.5 hours later than planned.

The return flight from DFW to GDL was on an Embraer with 1 seat on one side of the aisle and 2 abreast on the other side. I was in the single seat. This flight was full. A smooth flight with a smooth landing.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,5,2012-09-16,IAH to LAX. This was a pretty standard flight. The plane was small and the seats were uncomfortable feels like taking the bus but for a short flight it is hard to complain too much. The plane was a commuter with 2 sets on 1 side of the aisle and 1 on the other. I am 6'5 so my knees constantly dug into the seat in front of me and turbulence was painful like most economy class seats. The service staff was among some of the most friendly I have seen on a domestic airline but I'm sure that it varies from flight to flight. Captain displayed good communication with the passengers. Offered the usual non-alcoholic drinks in a small cup. I can't give any airline a good ranking on food and beverage that will charge for a bag of crackers. The flight departed and arrived on time however at LAX American Eagle crams you into a shuttle shoulder to shoulder to go to the main terminals. Overall not a bad experience and I will probably use them next time I fly to LAX.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,7,2012-08-20,I fly American Eagle a couple of times a month on business. The flights are almost always on-time. My only real complaint is the condition of the fleet - they really need to update their planes. The planes are incredibly cramped the seats are hard the storage is non-existent some wi-fi would be great for us business travelers. It's confusing that they accept only cash on board for alcohol/snacks when with most other carriers (including AA) it's the other way around. Still it's much better than UA Express to name one other regional carrier I've flown with recently.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,4,2012-08-05,Four flights. First and second leg out were fine no problems and on time. Return to Dallas on third leg was also good. Last leg home out of Dallas was to board at 5pm Waiting at gate after 5 and agent announced that the flight crew was late. Captain arrived about 5.15 but no Flight Attendant or First Officer. Substitute FA obtained and was told about 5.30 that FO was due shortly. 6pm still no FO but Captain had us board. Sat in hot plane (101 degrees outside) but FA did distribute water. Captain left cockpit returned around 7 pm and told us to leave the plane as he did not know when the FO would get there. 7.15 substitute FO arrived we re-boarded and lifted off from the runway around 7.40 arriving at our destination around 8.30pm. Plane had to wait for ground crew to finish with a Chicago arrival before we could get to the gate. Off the plane at 8.50.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,10,2012-06-17,Had a wonderful 1st flight with my fiancé. While we were on a short flight and sitting in coach the flight attendants made us feel as though we were in 1st class! I would highly recommend this airline for anyone looking for a comfortable trip.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,2,2012-06-13,Arrived in Nashville from Miami. Frustrating how much bad service they cram into such a short flight. When we got to our gate we were informed without apology that the gate had been changed. Once onboard it was apparent that we would be served with the same lack of professionalism. Having boarded 20 minutes late the pilot made up the time. My wife fell asleep but condensation from the air unit above started dripping on her. The seat front pocket was torn so badly that their included magazines kept spilling out onto the floor. After de-boarding those with gate checked luggage had to line up in the hall and wait for them. I was pleased that mine was second because it turned out that nearly everyone had a gate checked luggage thanks to more or less standard baggage fees. This made for a very messy de-planing. This is a time when companies like American Eagle should be attempting to compensate for their less maintained appearance by upping the ante on customer service. Sadly they are moving in the opposite direction.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
American Eagle customer review,,2012-05-28,Service was terrible. I flew from LGA to RDU day before yesterday. I had turned on the call light to get assistance. Attendant stood in the aisle talking to the guy a few rows up twice and never came even to ask what I needed. Someone cut the light off 3 times (and I again called). No one ever came to acknowledge the light much less to see what I needed. When on my way out I asked if she had seen my light (trying to give her the benefit of the doubt) she said they couldn't move around when the seatbelt light was on. The fasten seatbelt light wasn't on and she was moving around.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
American Eagle customer review,7,2012-05-07,DCA-JFK on an Embraer 140. Flight was on time. Airplane has seen much better days FA didn't really care about passengers but overall ok. For such a short flight I have no major complaints. Got me to my destination on time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,10,2012-04-12,JFK-ORF. Embraer 145 was very clean and quiet. Flight attendant was polite and helpful. The free drinks were a nice touch and the Captain seemed friendly over the PA system. There was very little or no turbulence so the ride was smooth. I will fly American Eagle again if necessary.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,5,2011-09-15,DTW to ORD. ERJ 145s are a little claustrophobic for tall people. Good enough plane for the 52 mins flight to Chicago. Wouldn't care for a much longer flight on one though. Flight attendant was very cheerful.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,5,2011-08-04,MIA-CLE a 3 hr flight on an ERJ 145. Very uncomfortable for the length of the flight and I am a small person. The only plus side was that being Executive Platinum I was offered free cocktails which was a nice gesture.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
American Eagle customer review,8,2011-08-04,ORD-YYZ and YUL-ORD. Comfortable flights free drinks (non-alcoholic). YUL-ORD delayed to oil problem with one of the engines but were kept regularly informed by flight crew.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,,2011-06-25,Flew from Chicago-Columbus Ohio. Flight delayed by 10 hrs. We were told only in 30-60 min. intervals and other airlines which left on time were flying half empty. Similar problem 2 days later going back to Chicago. Will avoid AE in future if at all possible.,False,,,First Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
American Eagle customer review,8,2011-03-31,San Diego - Los Angeles - Fresno. All the flights on Embraer 140 which I found roomy and comfortable. Leaving San Diego it was foggy and the gate agent was concerned and put us and other passenger on an earlier flight (the flight we were supposed to be on ended up cancelled). On a short 28 minute flight the flight attendant managed to serve beverages to a full aircraft. Our next flight to Fresno boarded early and left early with only around 10 people on board. Basic flight with a drink service and an early arrival into Fresno. American Eagle crews showed they care about passengers helped us avoid a potentially bad situation.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,10,2011-03-23,LGA-ATL on one of American Eagle's CRJ 700. In addition to a great flight and service what impressed me the most was to be on an American Eagle airplane that had been cleaned prior to departure. Attentive crew members and this service and experience is usually not the norm - but this was a great flight.,False,,,First Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,,2011-02-07,Absolutely appalling. Sat on tarmac for 2hrs 50 mins told staff that I would miss my 1:30am flight to HKG totally indifferent. Wouldn't let us off plane although obvious that we would miss connection. 10 minutes before arriving at Toronto pilot made announcement that Cathay were holding the flight for us - we shot off plane into an empty closed down airport. Cathay had left ages ago and we found out later they will not hold a plane for passengers unless baggage is loaded. Crew lied to us so they wouldn't have to help. We wandered around the closed airport all night and when found AA airline staff were told that we would have to fly back to NY to catch a flight in the afternoon - no compensation whatsoever and arrived in HKG totally exhausted. AA should have met us at gate - we were told later by an AA staff who confided that in her 25 years of work in the airline she had never seen such a decline in customer service. Flight back was also delayed deadheading a pilot - so we waited 3 hours.,False,,,First Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
American Eagle customer review,7,2011-01-17,Gainesville to Miami non-stop. Gainesville airport is only serviced by three airlines so my choices were limited. Flight was OK a 64 seat ATR-72 showing its age but in decent shape. The flight was 1hr 20mins but we were still served drinks. American Eagle is good in that you can pick your seat when you book the ticket online unlike some airlines which charge you. A warning though the ATR-72 has overhead bins but they are too small for regular carry-on bags. Things like backpacks and purses will fit but that's about it. If you do have a standard luggage carry on you will check it in right before you get to the plane and once you get off the plane it'll be there waiting for you. The ATR-72 boards from the back of the plane so pick seats in the back and you'll be off the plane first.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,7,2010-11-29,LAX-DEN. Very lucky to make my connection off a QANTAS flight from Australia due to delays in LAX security (even though 2 hours between flights). I made it to the gate but then told that I had to get a bus which wasn't arriving for another 10 minutes. This should be advised somewhere because I was not made aware of this fact. The Eagle terminal is ok but nothing to eat other than vending machines. ERJ140 flight across to Denver was very good - I have flown the ERJ a few times on AE recently and it is very comfortable for a regional jet. Had the single seat on the left hand side next to the aisle - fine for a 2 hour flight. Overall I don't mind flying on the ERJ - it beats a turboprop anyday!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,4,2010-11-29,Chicago ORD to YYC on a small CR7 jet. Overhead compartments won't take rollerbags so they have to be gate checked. Seats are small & uncomfortable. Fortunately the flight was less than half full so I sprawled out in the 2 economy seats in my row. The CR7 is too small of a plane to fly 3-4 hrs in. FAs pleasant and attentive enough.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
American Eagle customer review,2,2010-11-16,DCA-JFK as part of international trip. Check in staff extremely rude and abrasive. Wanted to charge for bag even though I was clearly on an international ticket. Problem solved by Admirals Club staff member who was superb and redeemed the flight. Was not warned that small Embraer cannot accommodate carry-ons which lead to delays and confusion during boarding. FA was unfriendly and seemed utterly disinterested in safety demo.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
American Eagle customer review,6,2010-10-27,DCA-JFK-DCA ERJ 140. Outbound flight was very good with on-time service an efficient and pleasant flight attendant plus informative crew. The inbound flight left the gate on time at JFK but didn't take off for another hour. Flight attendant provided minimal service. The outbound aircraft was newer but both were clean though the ERJ 140 is not comfortable due to the curvature of the fuselage at floor level. Checked baggage and valet cabin bags were delivered promptly. Overall this regional connector was acceptable for a flight of less than an hour not counting the pre-takeoff delay at JFK. Ticket price was higher than justifiable for this short flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
American Eagle customer review,,2010-09-24,DCA-JFK. Truly appalling experience. Apart from the 2.5 hrs delay due to which I missed a connection display of apathy indifference and condescension from multiple employees. The ground staff at DCA couldn't even advise if the incoming plane was in the air or not instead kept drip-feeding announcements of 30 mins delay each time. The lady didn't even have the decency to call JFK and explain my situation. At JFK in the middle of the night no AA staff was to be found finally a supervisor appeared at 5am and just sniggered at my problem of having missed the flight to Korea - not their problem apparently. The plane was shabby dirty and windows were barely kept together with a sticky tape.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
American Eagle customer review,9,2010-09-01,XNA-ORD-XNA. First class seats comfortable but overhead storage limited as the singe seat side on CRJ has had the bins removed. 3 Rows of first class on CRJ in a 1+2 format. Under seat storage is ample allowing 2 bags to be brought on board avoiding their annoying valet bag service that can take 30 minutes from landing to complete. In flight drinks and snacks very nice with pleasant FA - Gate agent was awful and tried to stop anyone bringing 2 carryons on (1 personal item and a bag that fits overhead) - young and impetuous. The addition of First Class on their CRJ has been a definite boost for this carrier - even in coach their drink selections have got better. Now I seek out CRJ flights.,False,,,First Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,9,2010-08-13,ORD-EVV on ERJ-145. Efficient and friendly male flight attendant. Plane small but overall fairly comfortable clean and well maintained. Flight attendant did a round of drinks and came back to offer seconds. On time departure and good service. Not bad for such a short flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,10,2010-06-06,I flew American Eagle between San Diego and Los Angeles International to catch an onward flight to London. The service was excellent on this very short flight (27 minutes). The flight attendant was friendly and diligent and made sure that everyone got a drink even though we were landing as soon as we took off. The flight left on time and landed early - can't ask for much more than that.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,8,2010-05-06,PHL-ORD-XNA. With a little luck I experienced the new First Class on American Eagle on their CRJ aircraft. I say luck as there is no clue that there would be first class on the flights - seat selection map was as normal - all one class but I happened to pick in the first 3 rows and got a first class seat FA told me that there is no priority given to frequent fliers and I felt that is an oversight by AE to show off their product to their best customers. Seats will be sold as first class from July 1. Seats were very comfortable - in fact the most comfortable American Eagle flights I have had! One downside is the loss of the overhead on the single seat side (there are 3 rows of 1+2) and one of the remaining bins contained an oxygen canister. Maybe AE missed a chance to put some full size bins on the one side? Definitely a step in the right direction for AE and I will no longer avoid their CRJ aircraft (as I do the Embraer).,False,,,First Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,5,2010-03-10,CLE-LGA JFK-CLE. I needed to get to NYC early to catch an international flight leaving from EWR (due to airline changing airports) and this was my only option at the time. I checked the seating chart and also called customer service to see what the flight load was and the rep said the plane was pretty full and for $50.00 I could do a same day confirmed standby so I did. I arrived at CLE gate to find only 7 passengers on the flight. What a rip-off! The FA was nice BOB for snacks. Return flight was much better flight was passengers PAX total . FA was great and very personable. Many carry-ons were gate checked and were received shortly after landing.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,8,2010-01-17,"Commuting from the midwest to Boston every week I have taken dozens of flights with American Eagle typically on a Embraer regional jet with the 1x2 seat layout. Presuming pricing is equal they are my preferred airline due to the Embraer aircraft. That said - pricing is all over the board. I may pay $200 one week and the next week the same flight is $400. I have preferred status so I always have access to the exit row (9 or 11) which are the only reasonably comfortable seats on the plane (1a is also ok if you have no Carry-On). Attendants are pleasant and attentive. Complimentary beverages are served but no snacks. Because the plane is small boarding and deplaning is quite fast. American Eagle allows gate checking of carry-ons which is necessary if you are taking anything more than about 9"" in depth. I have actually bought a rolling computer bag specifically because it is the size and shape of the Embraer overhead compartment. Don't expect a standard roller bag to fit - they don't even get close. Biggest complaint is overhead light maintenance - at least 1 of 5 flights the overhead light is burned out. 2nd biggest complaint is temperature. The front of the plane is hot and the rear is cold. The exit row gives extra legroom but it also is a cold seat in winter. Keep you coat handy. Overall it is a reasonable flying experience if you can keep from changing planes in LaGuardia.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,6,2010-01-01,Toronto to La Guardia. Very helpful at check in and gate. Small old aircraft but nice flight attendant on board and served a drink on the short flight. Age of airplane was my only concern.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,2,2009-12-29,Key West - MIA. Easy check in thereafter clueless/lacking service and rude staff. Plane late without any particular reason given. Succeeded to get places to the next flight which departed earlier only after insisting on various (non-responding uninterested) persons (we were about to miss the following transatlantic flight). Service onboard unfriendly.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
American Eagle customer review,8,2009-12-17,MIA-NAS and return with ATR72. Two nice short flights. But both legs were late - due to a technical problem and due to mismanagement of the ground staff - there was no one to unload the aircraft in Miami. American Eagle gates in MIA are very run-down.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
American Eagle customer review,,2009-12-14,Arrived at airport at 6 am this morning to find my flight cancelled due to fog (that's right low clouds). I am still sitting here at 11:10 am while listening to every other airline depart and arrive at this airport while American Eagle struggles to get their act together. I am looking at the departure board and every airline is on time except American Eagle. Travel at your own risk.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
American Eagle customer review,4,2009-12-11,"I was stuck in the same situation around the same time as the previous commenter. I waited in DFW airport for almost 3 days waiting for a flight out due to fog which was a legitimate problem. However my biggest complaint was the seeming nonchalance about the situation. After being put on standby after my initial flight was cancelled and watching the next 4 flights cancel as well I was informed that no more flights were going out that day (it was 7pm) and no more would be scheduled. Granted I don't know the specifics that need to take place to schedule/staff flights but I don't feel like AE/AA did anywhere near what they could have to remedy the situation. On another trip I arrived to the small regional airport I fly out of 40 minutes before my flight (I know they say an hour but its such a tiny place there is never an issue). I went to the check in desk and found that there were no AE/AA employees there. Anywhere. I asked the agent from another line what was going on and was told ""AE runs with only barebones staff and he went on break."" I waited 15 minutes until the agent arrived and was told ""Oh ma'am you missed your flight."" I then spent the rest of the day on standby trying to catch one of only a few flights out. I made it thank goodness but the nonchalance and general organization of AE definitely made for a less than pleasant trip.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
American Eagle customer review,1,2009-08-24,"DAL to LIT. Recently flew Am Eagle from Dallas to Little Rock. When I got on the plane the senior citizen next to me asked the stewardess where the restroom was located. The stewardess rudely stated that ""they announced at the gate that the restroom is broken and you should go before you get on the plane."" When we informed her that neither of us heard the annoucement she just stared. Then she said ""well it is just a short flight so it is okay-only 53 minutes."" I tried to explain that for us senior citizens that it is not okay and she just walked away. I mean come on. Can't they even maintain the restrooms? And to make matters worse I complained to American Airlines and have yet to get a response. Poor maintenance issues late flights and rude agents in the past made me start to doubt the airline and this is just the frosting on the cake!",False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
American Eagle customer review,2,2009-07-18,We were on the fourth flight scheduled from San Juan to Tortola BVI. The first three were cancelled due to mechanical problems with the plane.

In the future I will fly to St. Thomas and take the ferry to Tortola to avoid American Eagle.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
American Eagle customer review,1,2009-06-09,"YYZ-HEL-YYZ. I had booked a return trip from Toronto to Helsinki via JFK. The New York - Helsinki leg was on Finnair and the service on those flights was great but the Toronto - New York connection was sold to me as Finnair codeshare on American Eagle. Quite soon after I had arrived at Toronto checked in and gone through security it was announced that the American Eagle flight to JFK will be delayed by an hour because of ""bad weather"" at JFK. For me the delay meant missing my Finnair flight from JFK to HEL and so as soon as I heard about the delay I tried to track down the American Eagle/American Airlines staff in Toronto to see what can be done to help me make it on the Finnair flight. However the AE/AA staff was nowhere to be found. When I finally got to talk with them I talked with several people whose advice was basically just this: ""Well there is another Finnair flight from JFK to HEL the next day you just catch that one instead."" When I finally made it to JFK an hour and 10 minutes late the Finnair flight was leaving in 2 minutes. We were at gate 34 and Finnair at gate 4. I ran all the way and made it. Obviously my bag didn't. I would've liked to see AE/AA help me somehow along the way but nothing was offered. Glad I made it though and I got my bag the next day.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
American Eagle customer review,7,2009-05-11,YYZ-ORD-YYZ. Booked flights on American Eagle online then realised that they use rather small aircraft and regretted it! However our return flight from Toronto to Chicago was pretty good. Check in and bag drop was fast efficient and the AA staff on duty were courteous and friendly. Admiral's Club lounge was ok at both ends - complimentary glass of wine in ORD. Both flights on time and the advantage of these smaller Embraer 145s is that they can be filled and unloaded quickly. Efficient FA each way if not over friendly and complimentary soft drinks served. Seat belt sign on for duration of flights each way a few bumps here and there. Seats were comfortable enough for a one hour flight and leg room was ok (neither my partner or I are particularly small people). Landed early at Toronto and sat on runway for a few minutes waiting for gate to become available. But all in all a pretty good experience for the fare.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
American Eagle customer review,8,2008-12-01,ORD-BUF - a short hop on American Eagle and a very decent experience. Check in was fast and efficient and I was told I would be better off checking in my one bag on the airbridge which was very helpful. Boarding on time and I settled into 1A. It was nice to have some extra legroom at the front and not a problem being opposite the tiny galley - the crew member relieved me of my carry-on as no underseat storage and was prompt in asking if I needed it after take -off and also in returning it at the end. Flight left on time - plane was clean and we arrived ahead of schedule. Bags were quickly returned to the airbridge on deplaning. Overall short but very sweet experience.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,

American Eagle customer review,2,2008-04-10,Toronto to Louisville return via Chicago - Plane was 45 minutes late at departure which meant that I had to run to make my Chicago connection (they literally closed the door after me). We flew on Embraers on each flight - interiors in pretty poor shape and quite dirty with in-flight magazines looking as if they had been used to clean the floors. The seats were incredibly narrow and all planes were full. Service was very friendly though with the hostesses apologetic for the hideous quality of the snacks. Free soft drinks departing from Louisville but not from Toronto. I flew on an award ticket but I'm not sure I would pay full price for such a trip.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
