Iran Air customer review,1,2021-09-14,"In the absence of true competition in Iran's flight industry, Iran Air is misusing its monopoly by not being accountable towards passengers most of whom don't have any other option for direct flight to Iran.

I have no idea why it was only me that was asked to do this or if I was the only passenger booked on the other flight! Anyway the new flight was delayed by about an hour with no explanation. It was a newish (for Iran anyway) A320 and a substantial snack was provided. Legroom good and staff friendly and welcoming. My bag was the first out at Shiraz.

Iran Air customer review,1,2010-01-23,Tehran-Zahedan Economy. I am a regular traveller on this route probably flying to and from Zahedan from tehran about 12 times a year - an expert in terms of seating on these old A300 Fokker 100 and B727 aircraft. Always ask for seat by the exit door. You will otherwise experience severe cases of cramp and discomfort after each flight. The food on these flights normally comprises a cold platter two filled rolls a chocolate biscuit and an orange drink!

Iran Air customer review,2,2009-04-26,Dubai to Shiraz last year. Rather than paying for a hotel for the evening we camped in the abandoned kids playground hidden behind a small house in the airport. Morning came and we were ready to leave our plane was not. We were told all sorts of nonsense 'the plane will leave tomorrow or the day after' 'the plane will leave in a few hours' 'the plane has broken down' 'there is bad weather preventing flying'. Twelve hours later we left. I spent 24 solid hours in Dubai airport. The best toilets are the oldest ones furthest away from the duty free shops they're less used so hence less filthy. Finally got on the plane and they'd crammed three flights together into a massive pre- revolution 747. I felt bad for the staff copping a lot of flak and working a 14 hour day. The flight was short and the delay mammoth but perhaps it was all worth it because we met so many people! In short fly Iran Air if you have free time wanting to meet some locals.

Iran Air customer review,4,2009-01-13,Kuala Lumpur-Tehran-Kuala Lumpur. Aircraft was a 747SP. Check in at KUL handled by Malaysia Airlines. I requested a window seat but didn't get it (full flight). Boarding was about 30 minutes late. The seats were old and ragged. Entertainment on the main screen only (two Iranian films from the 1970s). Meal service good - two full meals provided. Great amenity kit handed out. The crew was friendly and attentive - they have pride in their airline even though it may not be the most modern. Arrival in Tehran was a little chaotic. Long queues and baggage claim. Overall it was a good experience. Paid $1100 Australian return for KUL-THR-KUL which was good value for two 7 hour flights. I would use them again - all part of the experience of going to Iran.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Iran Air customer review,1,2008-11-07,"I had 4 flights in July 2008 with Iran Air. There were the worst flights I've had in my life. The first flight was London to Tehran. The airplane was so old and the washroom was a big mess. The flight attendants were so rude and I’ve seen at least 2 load arguments between passengers and the attendants. The second flight Tehran to Tabriz. The airplane stopped in the middle of runway for the last minute maintenance. They didn't let us go back to the airport and we had to stay in the airplane for half an hour without air condition in mid summer. Well these are nothing comparing the nightmare I had when I was coming back from Tehran to London. The flight had 5 hours delay; which seems normal. There were at least 50 passengers among those people including me had a connection flight to other destination. When we asked the status about our next flight; which we lost it we've been told every thing has been organized and they already reserved a seat for our destination. Even though the Pilot in the airplane made a commitment few times that every thing is ok and we don't have to worry about our next flight. It was a joke. When we arrived to London nothing was organized and Iran air office even didn't know we are coming. When we asked about our connection flight he said"" Why did you come here? I already called Iran and asked them not to send them here!” After fighting about 3 hours we got the hotel to stay over night in London. I lost one day work and flew to Toronto with British Airways next day. My advice is never taking Iran Air.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Iran Air customer review,4,2008-09-30,Tehran-Isfahan-Shiraz-Tehran flight. I went on a 90s Fokker 100 from Tehran to Isfahan and to Shiraz (leased or bought from Iberia since some of the signs were in spanish) which was comfortable. The ticket only cost $30 for each leg. The service was a lot better than I expected finding bottled water in the seat pockets (luxurious compared to the 2 dollars you have to pay to get a cup of water with American Airlines) giving me a mint before the flight and serving a Snack. The seats were comfortable but I did not try the bathrooms (I heard too many stories that they did not work). They had excellent service for handicapped (my grandmother was with me). Crew is kind and attentive actually serving to the passengers request but don't interact much or show emotions. Shiraz-Tehran we took a Soviet era Tupolev 154m (which belonged to Iran Air tours) which while having the same service as mentioned above was extremely uncomfortable air conditoning broken and with all signs written in Russian - avoid Russian planes at all cost.

Iran Air customer review,,2006-04-29,LHR-THR-SYR and THR-LHR. This airline is doing the best it can with the equipment it has. Elderly (I'm assuming pre 1979) B747-200 in both directions. IR unable to acquire new Boeings due to US trade embargo. Apparently they now operate a new A330 on some routes so perhaps this old girl is on her way out. The aircraft was clean enough inside and out but unavoidably threadbare inside because of her age. Little things like my reading light switch operating that of a seat in front of me bits of plastic hanging off the arm rest and one of the loos not flushing properly tell me retirement is long overdue. However all credit to IR maintenance staff for keeping her going as long as she has on this busy route! I'd heard about IR pilots’ legendary landing skills and can confirm that these were the smoothest I've experienced in 27 years of flying. More up to date equipment used on the short connecting flight down to Shiraz: Fokker 100. Seemed well maintained. In-flight service was fine. Food simple but plentiful and seemed less processed than on some western carriers. Crew are very hard working. Unlike western crews in economy they didn't vanish behind a curtain after the meal was served but constantly responded to individual requests for drinks. Mostly male crew quite senior and with an air of quiet competence. Attentive caring but not obsequious which conformed with the approach to service I experienced generally in Iran during my stay. Perhaps it's mandated by the proprieties of public inter gender relations in Iran but I remember a female crew member asking me if I'd like 'coffee or tea'....no smile but with an air of seriousness that one might use when making a sincere inquiry about someone's health. Quite charming really!

Iran Air customer review,,2005-08-31,"I have flown on Iran Air for many years but our last couple of flights put me off.

So we had to change the soiled nappy on the floor of the aircraft not very pleasant for the other passengers I am sure! The entertainment is next to nil. Iranian movies are shown via old-style projectors and often the headphone sockets dont work. On our flight the entire left hand side did not work (no sound). On a previous flights although seated in non-smoking some passengers insisted on smoking. I raised this with the steward and he was reluctant to impose authority and ask the passengers to stop smoking. I had to get up and do it myself which is what the crew should have done. The aircraft are very old and safety comes to mind. Overall control of passengers by crew is very low. Aircraft is still on the runway after touchdown and passengers are getting their hand-luggage and standing up without much intervention by the cabin crew.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False

Iran Air customer review,,2005-06-06,"Iran Air has very good inflight catering - the food is good quality and you have a choice of two entrees both hot meals. However there is a fleet of old Boeings which look like they should be retired and grounded soon and at 30000 feet you really start to think about things like that. Flight attendants are very friendly attentive helpful and courteous however they are also very casual when it comes to safety. They do not enforce safety rules as rigidly as Western or European carriers do and when I alerted one of them that someone had been smoking in one of the lavatories (very dangerous - one of the many causes of cabin fires) his answer was a mere ""really?"" and that was the end of it. Also passengers were leaving their personal belongings next to their seats where they were cluttering the aisles and one had to be careful not to trip over them and once again the crew members made no attempt to get them to stow their belongings in the overhead bins or underneath their seats. Inflight entertainment is generally a Persian movie with English subtitles and for those who do not speak or understand Farsi the small and fast-moving subtitles can cause your eye-muscles to work overtime. Another complaint I have is that the flight attendants made no attempt to remind those seated in the non-smoking section to put their cigarettes out and being an asthma sufferer I had to remind three passengers in my vicinity that they were seated in the non-smoking section. They did have the good grace of putting out their cigarettes but I did not like being in that position. That was the flight attendants' job not mine. I would like to end my comments on a positive note however. Iran Air offers you the opportunity to fly for half of what Western carriers would charge you making travel to the Middle East easy and affordable. It also offers you the opportunity to experience Persian hospitality which is as old and ancient as Persia (Iran) itself. Crew members are delightfully pleasant and accomodating. Connections between Iran Air and other carriers serving European hubs are generally good and this particularly benefits expatriate Iranians living in the United States or Canada who wish to fly back to the old country on vacation with easy connections in Europe. For business travellers destined to other points in the region Iran Air is a good choice as it services most major airports in the Gulf and Middle East as well as some in Central Asia.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False

They do not enforce safety rules as rigidly as Western or European carriers do and when I alerted one of them that someone had been smoking in one of the lavatories (very dangerous - one of the many causes of cabin fires) his answer was a mere ""really?"" and that was the end of it. Also passengers were leaving their personal belongings next to their seats where they were cluttering the aisles and one had to be careful not to trip over them and once again the crew members made no attempt to get them to stow their belongings in the overhead bins or underneath their seats. Inflight entertainment is generally a Persian movie with English subtitles and for those who do not speak or understand Farsi the small and fast-moving subtitles can cause your eye-muscles to work overtime. Another complaint I have is that the flight attendants made no attempt to remind those seated in the non-smoking section to put their cigarettes out and being an asthma sufferer I had to remind three passengers in my vicinity that they were seated in the non-smoking section. They did have the good grace of putting out their cigarettes but I did not like being in that position. That was the flight attendants' job not mine. I would like to end my comments on a positive note however. Iran Air offers you the opportunity to fly for half of what Western carriers would charge you making travel to the Middle East easy and affordable. It also offers you the opportunity to experience Persian hospitality which is as old and ancient as Persia (Iran) itself. Crew members are delightfully pleasant and accomodating. Connections between Iran Air and other carriers serving European hubs are generally good and this particularly benefits expatriate Iranians living in the United States or Canada who wish to fly back to the old country on vacation with easy connections in Europe. For business travellers destined to other points in the region Iran Air is a good choice as it services most major airports in the Gulf and Middle East as well as some in Central Asia.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Iran Air customer review,,2005-03-06,CGN-HAM-THR at the end of December 2004 and back January 2005. First of all our flight was originally CGN-THR but due to one or another reason they flew to HAM first filled up the rather old but clean A310-300 with further passengers and then proceeded to THR. The result was that we arrived 6 hours delayed compared to what was previously planned. At least they called us one day before departure and told about the itinerary change. Furthermore we got a voucher of EUR 15- each for use in restaurants at CGN due to the delay. Inflight service was nice food was fine and women did not have to wear the headscarf onboard any more. Also took domestic flight at several occasions when travelling in Iran. THR-IFN IFN-SYZ KSH-THR and BND-THR (intermediate stop at IFN) on F100 B727 and A300B4 were fine on time good catering. They keep an old fleet that well-maintained and clean.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False

Iran Air customer review,,2004-10-11,Tehran-Esfahan-Tehran on a Fokker. Iran Air are a bit dubious on the ground but the service was good in the air.

Iran Air customer review,,2004-10-09,Flew on Iran air earlier this week from Tehran to Beirut. The flight itself was on time and a reasonable meal was served. But what surprised me is that as soon as the plane landed and whilst still taxing to the gate people were are up getting bags out of the overhead lockers and beginning to queue at the door!. We hadn't even made it off the runway. The flight attendants didn't do or say anything. Surely this is a safety issue!,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False

Iran Air customer review,,2003-10-15,Flown the Frankfurt-THR route. In my experience I have never heard an airline flying to THR cheaper than Iran Air does and the pilots are obviously very skilled. But there are negative sides to flying Iran Air. First of all although their Aibus fleet is one of the safest in the world their other aircrafts (Boeing747(SP)727 and Russian aircraft) are one of the oldest and most dangerous - so my advice try to avoid these aircraft when flying Iran AIr. Luckily most European flights are with the Airbus fleet. I also know that the poor shape of their Boeing fleet is not caused by neglect but the fact that the Iranian government can't buy spare parts for these aircraft from the US (politics and stuff). Also inflght entertainment is almost non-existent (not even in their Business class) especially if you don't like Farsi spoken movies shown on a projector so bring a book/magazine/walkman or whatever. My advice is to fly Iran Aar if you are sure that they are using an Airbus aircraft and if you are more concerned about your budget then about stuff like inflight entertainment or alcoholic drinks.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False

Iran Air customer review,,2003-08-31,"In my own opinion the technical state of the fleet is quite poor but there is not any solution for it since the embargo placed by US doesn't allow the Iranians to improve the technical profile of the planes. Food is standard and inexpensive. I do not remember to have more than two different servings options in all of my flights. a ""Tortilla"" of potatoes eggs and soft drink salad but nothing extra. Perhaps rice with chicken in the Iranian way and nothing more. But I have to emphasise and recognise that Iranians are perhaps the most friendly and ""ready to do"" air crew of the world! They are fantastic. And it happens in all of the flights. Always with a smile and ready to do their best!",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False

Iran Air customer review,,2003-08-12,I have used Iran Air for several Asian and Euro destinations as well as many domestic flights. It was always a B747 for international and A300/B727 for domestic flights. The flight attendants are mixture of old ladies and young guys with beard and mustache. Apart from that their service is not bad. There seems to be a clear distinction between flight attendants before and after revolution. The former are very prestigious. Food is great! There is basically no entertainment so don't wait for it. But the flights are comfortable. It is a warm environment and I like it. Airports are like train stations in Europe - if not worse. But it is better than Indian or Pakistani airports anyway! When flying with an Iran Air B747 just remember it is 25 years old! One great advantage of this airline is the cheap domestic flights but apparently that is not going to last long.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False

Iran Air customer review,,2003-05-02,Iran Air only operates from one city of Pakistan and that is Karachi where it has flights every Wednesday. The flights are always late and it has become a routine for frequent flyers last time I travelled it was 3 hours late! The aircraft used for international routes are old Boeings or Airbus A-300s and there is almost no onboard entertainment. For domestic travels Iran Air uses the name of Iran Air Tours The aircrafts used are mostly old Russian aircraft and almost every time I travel the trip has been a jerky and turbulent one - specially the landings. Only snacks like juice pistachios and cakes are offered during domestic flights. The airports all over Iran are very simple but are neat and clean. One thing must be admitted that Iran Air is very cheap - whether travelling international or domestic routes as compared to other countries airlines. All in all I would suggest travelling Iran Air just for the sake of adventure and fun - if not for anything else.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
