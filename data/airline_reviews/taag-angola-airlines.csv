Service was friendly even with a full flight. No inflight entertainment system. Arriving in Luanda we had to take the rapid test in a hanger. The process takes around 30-60 minutes depending how full flights are. For our return flight (2 weeks later) they thankfully stopped this mandatory testing. You just need to show your negative RT-PCR test (not older than 72 hours of flight). It does not matter if you’re vaccinated or not, the PCR test is all they want to see. Rapid covid tests are not permitted for leaving SA or Portugal. Ground staff are well informed. The wait at Luanda airport was long around 5 hours before boarding the next flight close to midnight. We flew TAAG 5 years ago so coming back to Luanda we had an idea what to expect. In short it’s a chaotic basic airport with little to offer except expensive drinks and food. There are even strange flea market type stalls selling traditional African items. Admittedly the airport has been upgraded a bit, now offering a duty free store and more open seating. This time we stayed in the Pall lounge using our Lounge Key Visa benefit. The lounge is basic but comfortable. They give you a few vouchers to exchange for drinks or toasted sandwiches. At least it is airconditioned. The flight to Lisbon was on a modern 777-300ER with a 3-3-3 seating with some of the best leg room I’ve experienced. At 1.86m tall, I still had plenty room in front of my knees. At present their inflight entertainment system has been turned off. This did not bother us, as at midnight you don’t really want to watch movies…the flight is only 7 hours to Lisbon so sleep comes in handy for a full day ahead. Shortly after take off, they bring you dinner. We had a choice of beef or bacalhau (fish) which was actually quite tasty. The toilets were clean on all flights. Breakfast was also served around 90 minutes before landing in Lisbon. Coming back to Cape Town was only a 2.5 hours transit at Luanda so quite convenient. To go back to SA you don’t need a PCR test if you are vaccinated. If not vaccinated then you have to do the test which is quite expensive around 80euros. All 4 flights there and back were perfectly on time, some even landed earlier than stated. Luggage allowance. Most tickets now cover you for 2 x 23kg bags in economy. Masks have to be worn on all flights except when eating but not heavily enforced.

"""cabin crew were friendly and efficient""",9,2016-09-26,"✅ Verified Review |  Needing to get from Cape Town to Lisbon and back again wasting as little time as possible, I found that TAAG fly this route, with a change of planes in Luanda. Not knowing quite what to expect, I booked, and was pleasantly surprised. The planes on the Cape Town - Luanda legs are a bit old and tatty, and on the outward leg the entertainment system did not work. They are 777s, but in 3-4-3 configuration in Economy. The main downside of this route is Luanda airport, which is Ok, but somewhere you don't want to have to stay too long. The Luanda - Lisbon legs are operated by new 777-300ER planes in 3-3-3 configuration with good entertainment systems, but maybe not the best choice of films. Food and service was good.

"""service was outstanding""",8,2016-07-14,"Cape Town to Lisbon via Luanda with TAAG Angolan. Seamless check-in in Cape Town with luggage checked all the way to Lisbon. Older 777-200 on first leg to Luanda. Old AVOD system but decent selection. Seats needed a clean but otherwise comfortable for 3 hour leg. Largely male cabin crew who went out of their way to chat and were friendly. Food was lamb, well presented and tasty. Luanda Airport is something to miss if possible. Final leg onwards to Lisbon was on board their new 777-300ER which was 2 months old. Cabin crew once again friendly, engaging. Food was special meals (steamed fish, vegetables, lovely sauce) with coconut cake. All better than expected and I finished it. The AVOD and seat on the new plane was wonderful. The service was outstanding, the plane exceptionally clean and I would recommend this airline. The cabin crew dealt with a number of unaccompanied minors in a most sincere fashion both on board and with the ground team.

Flew TAAG Angola Airlines, Cape Town to Lisbon via Luanda. Left on time, the service was slightly reserved but at least not false, good food and enough leg space.

My complaint is that it was overpriced for the quality of the flight. The planes for both legs were clean although cabins were not well maintained. The service on board was abysmal. There were no courtesy from the FAs. The toilets were run out of toilet papers and were dirty but FAs didn't bother to clean them up. The food were just for survival.

TAAG Angola Airlines customer review,7,2013-09-10,I recently started using TAAG more regularly especially flying to South Africa the aircraft's are fresh clean and new the staff friendly and professional. The airlines services are excellent from online booking to early check-ins in Luanda. There are still areas with room for improvement such as the inflight entertainment choice and catering presentation on Business class. These two issues tackled TAAG will be providing a world class service that can compete with the best in the African continent and globally.,False,,,Business Class,,,5,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,True,
TAAG Angola Airlines customer review,4,2013-07-19,Flew Luanda/Lisbon on business class. Boeing 777 very clean.

TAAG Angola Airlines customer review,6,2013-03-21,LAD-DXB. Was surprised with the level of service provided on the flight. Following the check in at Luanda the flight was pretty good. Departed 30 mins late and arrived early in Dubai. Flight was not very full so plenty of space to spread out. Food while basic was of good standard and the drinks service was good. The plane was a new B777. IFE system is basic but being a late night flight didn't really use it. Having a basic understanding of Portuguese helped but all crew spoke and understood English.

TAAG Angola Airlines customer review,5,2012-12-04,LAD-JNB trip in economy class. Noticed a big improvement with the staff at the check-in counters.

TAAG Angola Airlines customer review,4,2012-02-20,LAD-CPT-LAD. Check-in easy no problems. The flights were uneventful but the interior of the planes were very old and it appeared that at least one armrest in each row was broken as they were taped up or visibly falling apart. Seats from LAD to CPT were quite comfortable but there was no IFE for a nearly 4 hr flight. CPT to LAD the seats were very uncomfortable. IFE on this flight on drop-down screens but the audio was played over the PA system so it was difficult to hear. Overall customer service was typical of Angola - non-existent. I would only recommend for the convenience to CPT from LAD.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
TAAG Angola Airlines customer review,7,2010-09-10,LIS to LAD. The flight was delayed seven hours - first because of a mechanical problem and then because of the airport curfew in LIS. This left only 30 minutes to make our connection in LAD for our flight to WDH. TAAG put us in a hotel for the night free of charge. The staff in LIS were helpful and friendly. We ended up making our 30 minute connection because a TAAG agent in Luanda had checked us in for our connecting flight and escorted us to our Air Namibia flight to WDH. The flight was operated by a Boeing 777-200ER which was comfortable. There is AVOD mood lighting footrests and winged headrests on this aircraft. The food was tasty and cabin crew friendly.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
TAAG Angola Airlines customer review,2,2010-09-01,TAAG's good air service is sabotaged by the Luanda ground service staff. We have flown once from Luanda/Cape Town and once from Windhoek to Luanda. Those three flights left almost an hour late but once in the air the service in Economy class was pleasant. We received free drinks and a hot meal. The attendants were very pleasant as well. The ground service in Luanda for international flights is acceptable.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
TAAG Angola Airlines customer review,1,2010-01-20,As I arrived in JNB from Cape Town I noticed that my flight to Luanda was cancelled. No explanation from anybody I found out that all TAAG flights earlier the week was cancelled. Just to be told tomorrows flight will be first come first serve I had to arrange and pay for my own accommodation in JNB. Next day check in at 09h00was informed plane was late sit at the airport until that afternoon. No food or drinks was offered to the passengers only boarded plane at 1800. I noticed my booked seat was taken I showed my pass to one staff member and I were pushed into another seat staff very rude and unhelpful. Onboard entertainment poor.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
TAAG Angola Airlines customer review,1,2009-04-18,I have flown with SAA before and with TAAG. The flights on TAAG have not been to bad I unfortunately do not understand or speak Portuguese and this I find a problem. With regards to the service I cannot complain. I have a complaint about the airport personnel at Luanda. They are rude pass comments on all foreign clients and give us a hard time in general. Should you have any dollars with you they confiscate them and tell you that you cannot keep the money with you. This I have a problem with. If you cannot keep your dollars on you how are you supposed to buy any cold drink or food while you wait for the flight? This is not complimentary from TAAG. The airport is dirty to boot. Today I am struggling with my ticket back to JNB and will most certainly not make use of TAAG again. I will use SAA in future as I can depend on them.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
TAAG Angola Airlines customer review,1,2009-01-14,TAAG business class a few weeks go from Luanda to Johannesburg and was astonished at the poor and unprofessional service encountered from check in to my destination. I arrived at the airport at 0530 which was the check in time written on my ticket by the lady at the TAAG office only to find that check in for the flight will only start at 0630. When the check in eventually started I was confronted by a security guard who told me to go to the back of the economy class line despite my business class ticket. Two hours later I was checked in and besides the customs official who wanted to confiscate my camera because it had rechargable batteries in it and the fiscal official who demanded a detailed explanation for the $1100 I had with me I went to the business class lounge. There was no coffee no tea and only four bottles of water in the refrigerator and four bunched up sandwiches with what looked like ketchup on it. I asked the lady attendant for some coffee. She did not reply disappeared and I never saw her or the coffee again. Boarding late due to some delay (B747) went fine and I was in my seat with no trouble - which I had to clean and get rid of a handful of dried bread crumbs. The cabin staff were an unfriendly bunch of which only one could speak a very broken English on an international flight. I fortunately speak reasonable Portuguese which helped. Service had a taste of rudeness in from most of cabin staff. Food in the business class was appaling. The beef was cold and served in exactly the same holders as economy class and with plastic utensils and cups. The bread resembled good old fashioned rusks as I suspect that it came from the previous day and coffee was cold. Passengers needed to request the attendants to remove meal trays after an hour had gone by in which they were giggling away in the galley area and not attending to passengers. The toilets on the aircraft were filthy. Onboard entertainment was a movie with no earphones available. When disembarking at Jhb - Oliver Tambo - the one air hostess rudely refused an economy class passenger a quick exit before business class passengers as he was running out of time to make check in for a connecting flight - even though he produced his ticket to the air hostess and the TAAG flight left Luanda 45 minutes late. TAAG should pull up their socks if they want to become part of global economy in the airline business. Their business class service at the airport is poor to say the least and onboard service even worse. Their cabin staff need a course in manners and professionalism and quality control on the aircraft needs to be addressed. Passengers pay extra for business class service but plastic eating utensils and poor quality food and service hardly justifies that.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
TAAG Angola Airlines customer review,1,2008-03-19,Initially the flight was supposed to leave at 12h00 midday. On our arrival at the airport we were told that the flight would leave at 22h00 that evening and check in start at 17h00. Long story short we only left the following morning at 05h20. The business class lounge had no more drinks at 20h00 not even a glass of water. No apologies offered. The food was terrible and the service unfriendly bordering on rude. Inflight entertainment non-existing! Our connecting flights all missed no accommodation offered. A trip from Luanda to Goiania that should have taken me 12 hours took 28 hours of travelling. The return trip was scheduled to Leave Luanda on Tuesday 11 March at 18h00. I left the interior very early on Tuesday morning (04h00) arriving at Rio airport at midday ready to check in. I was informed at 14h00 that the flight was cancelled and that I should return the next morning at 05h00 to be on the stand-by list! No accomodation offered. I booked into a hotel at my own costs and returned the next morning at 05h00. Finally got on the plane by 10h00 and the flight took off at 10h30. Inflight entertainment was a movie with sub-titles in English but no microphones offered. The food was absolutely horrible. Needless to say there are no other airlines flying this route and beggars cant be choosy!,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
TAAG Angola Airlines customer review,1,2007-08-22,I used to fly TAAG back and forth to Paris. What a shambles - delays were the norm with no explanation from anyone. A delay at Luanda airport we could handle (just) as long as the bar was kept open but when they shut the bar at 10 with no warning that was it! As for the flights meals on the plane were practically thrown at the passengers and I can honestly say that the staff were often quite rude and in no way helpful to anyone. Why they were there I can only guess and I think it may have something to do with the drinks trolley. The planes until very recently were more suited to sitting in a museum. Thankfully our company have now refused to allow us to fly with this mickey- mouse airline and given the choice I would never fly with them again.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
TAAG Angola Airlines customer review,3,2007-08-01,Lisboa-Luanda Luanda-Rio de Janeiro. First leg of the trip on Boeing 777. Very nice confortable seats. PTV's with AVOD ok. Food normal. The breakfast was tiny. Second leg of the trip on Boeing 747 Mixed. Seats more confortable than the 777 but the inflight entertainment was disappointing.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
TAAG Angola Airlines customer review,,2007-07-14,Boeing 777 configuration was 3-4-3 in economy class. The flight was almost completely full in Economy class not sure about Business or First class. Seat was comfortable legroom was okay and had a foot rest and a normal size PTV. Oddly enough the jack for the head set was straight in front instead of in the armrest. They had big pillows and blanket at every seat. I was seated towards the back in row 32; last row was 38 on TAAG’s 777. The seat also had the “winged” headrest to make for easier sleeping. Candy (honey) was given out - a nice gesture. Fairly soon after take off dinner was served. During dinner the crew came around again with a second round of drinks including wine. The crew in general was a bit reserved but friendly. There was the new mood lighting but only in F and C class. I tried their inflight entertainment system which is AVOD and it was okay. Water was offered once during the flight by the flight attendants. Breakfast was served about 1.5 hours before arrival and was very small; smallest I have ever seen but very good. To sum it up TAAG was a very pleasant surprise having heard of horror stories and also since they don’t have a functioning website. TAAG was just as modern comfortable as European carriers and it was a great experience.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
TAAG Angola Airlines customer review,,2006-11-04,TAAG Angola Airlines are a complete shambles. Our flight out to Luanda from Windhoek was delayed 18hrs. We are currently (2 November 2006) still waiting for our return flight after our flight was today cancelled for the third successive day. The worst part is that they tell you the flight will leave early and then end up stringing you along all day at the airport before you finally find out there is no plane. I have now wasted 3 days at the airport. No one seems to have a clue what is going on there is no information provided on delays or reasons and it has proved impossible to identify a ´responsible´person. I could go on an on about the problems we have experienced. Avoid using them at all costs!,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
