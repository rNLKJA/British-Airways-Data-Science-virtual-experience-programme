"""Service was smooth""",8,2019-11-20,"I had serious concerns about this airline before taking my trip, but ended up having a very good experience. So I promised myself I will write a review about it. Best value for money: what caused me to book was the offer of flying a flat bed C-class seat from JFK to Shanghai for $2,200 (return tkt), only with a quick stopover of 90 minutes in PEK. Pre-flight concerns: - I kept receiving automated emails from the airline that my itinerary has changed and that I should contact them and I can change/get a refund for my tkt. The small change that happened once was a 5 minute change in departure time which increased my layover in PEK (good thing, since you need those 90 minute to transfer) - customer service: it's impossible to reach them by phone, the line is not manned. So I emailed them. They responded within 24hrs (or so) and said that my flight's transfer time in PEK is too short and my tkt needs to be changed. But when I went online I saw that my same exact flight itinerary was still being sold on various websites, incl. airchina.us. - The inconsistent response from their customer service really got me worried about the reliability of this airline, so I did some more research online on helpful reviews. I mostly read terrible reviews on how delayed the flights were, people missing their connections and being treated very poorly. That's when I got really worried about having booked this ticket, but figured I will take the risk. Also TPG wrote a fairly good review on them, so that felt comforting. Flight: - Outbound: upper deck of Boeing 747, half empty cabin. Seat was perfectly comfortable (flat bed). Service was smooth, food was good/fine - meat a bit chewy. Staff are friendly and helpful, though be aware they only speak limited english. - Inbound: Boeing 777-300 - full cabin. Seat perfectly comfortable (flat bed). Service was great, they accommodated my specific food requests despite not having ordered in advance. Overall a great flying experience. - All flights were pretty much on time - In-flight entertainment is ok, limited movies selection / limited music selection - no WIFI. Transfers in PEK: - 90 minutes is definitely needed if transferring. You need to take a quick 'airtrain' trip from domestic to intl., even if you don't change Terminals. The connecting flight to and from SHA was a tarmac parked aircraft with bus transfers, so that added time as well.

"""They just don't care""",1,2019-06-26,"New York to Bangkok via Beijing. I've been traveling for years and this is the 1st and last time I will ever use them. I just got married and my husband and I planned a 2 month honeymoon to Asia. We purchased a round trip from JFK with a layover in Beijing before arriving in Bangkok. The return flight was from Hong Kong with layover in Beijing before landing in Newark, NJ. Our flight in April to Bangkok experienced multiple delays which caused us to miss our layover in Beijing by 5 minutes. We actually had a 75 mins layover in Beijing, but due to the delays, we and almost everyone else on our plane missed our transfers. They couldn't tell their other planes to wait 5-10 mins for everyone to make their flights?? Instead, we saw most of the fliers crowded around the Air China counter. Everyone had to get a temporary visa and herd onto their buses to spend a night in a disgusting, filthy motel because the next flights out were the following day. My husband and I missed our 1st night in Bangkok and of course weren't reimbursed in any way. Throughout the ordeal, we saw all of the passengers at the Air China counters and they, like us, were appalled and furious with their lack of customer service. They just don't care. Now for our flight returning back to NY from Hong Kong on 6/17. We received an email saying that Air China changed our flights so we called Chase Travel. We saw that they changed the planes, times and moved us from Premium Economy to Economy. Why? We paid the extra amount for Economy. Once on the phone with Chase, we selected another flight for 7:30AM that was Premium Economy. We even waited on the phone until we received the email confirmation from Chase for our new flights. So on 6/17 we get to HK airport to check in and they only have my husband's name and not mine. Air China said I was on a 11PM flight and that it was Chase's fault. That was not the case. My husband and I spent hours on the phone with Chase and Air China, and Air China were the ones to cancel my ticket (we have no idea why). Instead of just putting me on the 7:30AM flight, they kept my husband on hold for 50 minutes, then finally told him that they could change his flight for $4000 to be with me for the 11PM. How does that make sense? Why are we being punished for Air China's mistake? They changed our flights then split us up but putting us on different flights that land in different airports. Then they have the audacity to tell him to pay $4000 for him to be on the 11PM when they could've just put me on the 7:30AM which was confirmed. They could have even put us on the next Air China flight after that. My husband ended up purchasing completely new flights with EVA which was $2800 compared to the $2500 round trip with Air China! It's now 7/25 and I've been on the phone with Chase for almost 4.5 hours because the supervisor is trying to get Air China to give us a refund.

Get out of the plane. Pass US immigration. Wait for your luggage. Clear US Customs. Then haul your luggage to a different terminal to Check in all over again. Clear security again. Then wait for the flight. The experience was horrible! It is clear why they have to leave set aside 4 hours for everyone to pass immigration and get their luggage and check back in.

You still need to clear immigration, but at least you don't have to wait for luggage, clear customs and then find a different terminal! In Mexico you don't even need to clear immigration during the stop. The same circus happened in Houston on the return trip. So while it's great that the Air China have started flying to Panama, they really need to re-think their routing, because what they have is awful. Ideally, they would use a 787 and fly nonstop, but if a stop needs to be made, the worst place to make it is in the US. They would have been better off doing the technical stop in Mexico or in Toronto.

I got very very lucky in the end, but some people on the same plane as me, not so much at all! I had a connection in Shanghai Pudong (PVG), with only 2 hours to connect there to continue onto Tokyo Narita. I consider myself a pretty seasoned traveler (this was my 5th international trip this year). I've read many reviews, so a couple days before, up to the night before the departure, I was looking up stats for this flight to see its on time arrivals. More than 6 out of the last 10 flights landed at least 40 mins late. I was concerned! I got to the airport, relaxed in the lounge at SJC, then noticed my flight was delayed by 1 hour since they claimed the plane arrived late. My connection time just got cut in half! Not only that, when I went to check in my bags, they said I had to collect my bags in Shanghai, and recheck them in and get a new forward boarding pass to Tokyo. With only 1 hour to get through customs and do all that, I felt there was really no way I was going to make it. I looked up Air China flights from PVG to NRT, and my flight was supposed to be the last one out. So my plane got in over 30 mins late, and the customs line looked to be at least an hour long. I had less than 30 minutes now to go through customs and recheck my bags. No way was I going to make it. I decided to just not risk my luck and go into the 24-hour visa-free line to stay overnight. The customs guy asked me why I was in this line, I said, well my flight is about to take off in 10 minutes (and then he asked me why I'm late, and it's like, well my plane just got in, that's why I'm here aren't I? It's not like I'm on the departures side and it's my fault). So anyways, he continues on and finds a supervisor from Air China for us. At this time, the day before, the huge typhoon hit the Kansai region, so all flights to Osaka got cancelled as well. He told the group going to Osaka that they'd have to fly to NRT. He said we'd all be rebooked on the 1st flight available, which would be next day 10AM and we would be provided accommodations for the night. He told us to go find him at the check-in kiosk after we're done with customs and collect our luggage. So once we all collected our luggage, we went to the desk where he told us he'd be at, and was nowhere to be found. So we got in line at the Air China Customer Service counter.

"""horrendous customer service""",1,2018-06-08,"Not Verified |  Vancouver to Hong Kong via Beijing. I have never been compelled to write a review for anything. Ever. That was until I experienced the absolute most horrendous customer service from Air China.  I was travelling with a group of 7. I had booked a round trip from Edmonton to Hong Kong. This booking was done via Flight Hub which would include an Air Canada flight from Edmonton to Vancouver and an Air China flight to HK. Upon arrival at the airport in Edmonton Air Canada alerted me that my middle name was missing from the flight info and were happy to add it. Air Canada updated both my boarding passes. When I got to Vancouver I went to the Air China check in counter to receive my boarding pass and I waited 2 hours until they told me I wouldn't be allowed on the flight because of my missing middle name. This information came was communicated to me 10 minutes before gate closing. This gave me absolutely no time to contact Air Canada or Flight Hub for help. Air China were unwilling to add my middle name despite showing my passport and other government issued IDs. I had to cancel and rebook my entire round trip because they wouldn't add my middle name on the return flight either. One of my friends stayed behind and took the flight with me. On the return flight my friend was rejected from the flight for ""breaking the sequence"". Upon enquiry Air China confirmed that his seat was still reserved for him but he would have to pay an $1200 USD to get it back. Air China was incredibly unhelpful and threatened to call security when was asked why he was rejected from the flight even though they themselves confirmed the seat was reserved for him.",False,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Hong Kong via Beijing,June 2018,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,1,False

I am writing today warn off my fellow travelers from this airline which probably should be de-certified in a number of territories. I recently booked a ticket from Seoul to Beijing on the US website. Unfortunately there is a glitch in a the system and my name repeated itself (for example it appears as John John Smith Smith). I also can confirm this was not me accidentally entering my name twice because - before noticing the error - I booked a second itinerary and the same thing happened. And now for the incredible waste of time. The US 800 number basically does not answer. When calling the 24 hour number in China given their poor English they seemed convinced that I was somehow trying to do a name change. The UK number answers on a loop - throughout the UK work day - that the call center opens at 9am. Then disconnects. The French number on the Air China website is not valid. The loss of time in the last 48 hours has been absolutely breathtaking and I would have paid the double with another airline had I known. Resolution? 40 minutes to get a US rep who asked that I send my passport in despite confirming that there is a glitch in their booking system which allows for passenger names to be repeated.

That is true and you see it from the very beginning when boarding the plane. You go through business class and it looks basic as well, just the full flat seats that remind you of business class. Economy is worse, except the seat legroom which I found better than most of the European airlines when flying long haul. The entertainment system is old and has only 1-2 movies in English, and almost unusable. It responds 5 seconds after you've pressed the button (no touch screen), the image quality is bad and the sound even worse. I had to use my headphones in order to understand something. But, the choices of foreign (not Chinese) movies was big and I had some novelties from the US, there were many European movies, a Chilean one and so on, all of them translated into English. The series were lacking the usual suspects from the US so I had to stick with the movies. Even the Chinese ones were subtitled, so after all a good surprise. The flight attendants did everything to make our trip nice and although the knowledge on English is basic (really basic), they struggled to make us feel welcome and asked if we needed something. They  provided a blanket for the 3h flight from PEK to HKG. The food was average, but better than some other better considered airlines. For breakfast there was  a western style one offered with omelet, chicken sausage and hash browns which wasn't bad at all. When it comes to beverages, the tea was very good, coffee so and so, the juices were nice (orange, apple, tomato) and the beer and wines (Chinese brands) were awful. I  only experienced a half an hour delay once, with 12 legs flown in 2 weeks with them, so big surprise, they also land 45 minutes before schedule. Connecting in Beijing is almost a nightmare, but I have survived, give that the connecting time was decent, though not to much in order to get bored. Bottom line, Air China succeeded to impress me.

Also, facilities such as immigration, security, signage etc at both Beijing and Shanghai airports are poor, and while these are not the fault of the airline, they affect the customer experience.

There are some good parts, such as the fact that the seat pitch is huge. The food was generally surprisingly good and often reflected local food at the place of departure (nice Tilsiter cheese and dry meat which, ironically, you don't get on Swiss in economy). Beer and wine were offered twice, before meal times. On the other hand, the plane interior itself was probably due for an upgrade, notably the in-flight entertainment system. On both outward legs, there were individual screens with 12 channels showing 6 films on repeat (with different audio). Unfortunately only two were in English (and one channel was made up of documentaries that switched language; one Chinese moving had illegible English subtitles) and the same movies were shown from Geneva to Beijing (10 hours) as from Beijing to Tokyo (3 hours) so I was rather bored. My return leg from Shanghai to Frankfurt did have touchscreens with a good selection, though. The staff were pleasant - decent English skills and I felt like someone came around offering water every 10-15 minutes for the whole flight each time. On all four legs, the plane had a recorded announcement from the flight's ""safety officer"" listing behaviours that were illegal under Chinese law (climbing on seats, trying to open exits in-flight, preventing cabin attendants from going about duties), the staff then turn off the lights and ask for windows to be closed straight after the meal (even when it's only mid-afternoon at the point of departure) and at the end, the purser thanks the passengers for their cooperation. It all felt about pre-empted riot prevention. Two legs delayed by an hour - at least one was due to air traffic control restrictions which is not Air China's fault as such, but something you have to consider if you choose to transit through any airport in PRC. Also worth knowing is that they will put you up in a cheap hotel near-ish the airport if you have an overnight layover but you have to know to ask. All in all, it was fine given that it was 30% cheaper than the competition but I couldn't help feeling jealous of the passengers flying on CA's code-shares served by ANA's 787 and Lufthansa's A380.

What can I say, it lived up to my lowest expectations, and the worst were international routes, especially the one from Milan to Beijing. We flew on an A330 but the aircraft looked as old as the hills and was impossibly noisy, so much so that I had serious trouble following the movies I was watching. Corridors are narrow and the space between seats is very limited and their entertainment offer is mostly made of Chinese movies. On top of that, my monitor was completely dead and there was no way to bring it back to life. I pointed it out to the flight attendants many times and they kept coming and going first trying to fix it themselves and then saying they'd try to reset the whole system, but to no avail. Luckily there was a spare seat in the row in front of me so I moved there, only to find out that the guy who had been previously sitting there had moved away himself because that monitor wasn't working properly either. As it turned out, it was insanely slow and some buttons on the remote weren't working (yeah there were remotes if you're wondering, the ones you pull out of the seat and then back in), but hey that was as good as it went! The service was virtually non existent - the crew only stopped by twice for meals and that was it. If you wanted water you had to look for them yourself and ask for it and they would come and pour you a glass of water. As for the food, I didn't touch anything because it was terrible. Overall it made for a very uncomfortable flight. A guy sitting next to me told me he had flown with Air China in the past for work, but he didn't recall it to be that bad and that the aircraft looked the same as the one he had flew in 10 years ago. This said, it should hardly be surprising that I was dreading the idea of having to take internal flights as I was expecting those aircrafts to be even older. I was pleasantly surprised instead since their internal routes turned out to be much better. The aircrafts were just regular airbuses and they were quiet enough. Oh one more thing, the pilots' English is barely understandable, I'm no native speaker but I'm fluent in English so I don't have any trouble with listening, but these pilots are the worst! Flight attendants are slightly better, but don't venture beyond basic stuff or else you'll lose them. In summary, the only plus is that it's is way cheaper than any other airline and offers highly competitive fares, however if you have a choice pick another airline at least for your long-haul flight!

He then informed me that he would try to reset the tv again, and would try to get the seat to recline. By this time it was about 6am in the morning, as we had departed 2am Beijing time. So no chair that reclined, nor a tv that worked. Feeling very frustrated i called the attendant again and told him that this was unacceptable. During all this time, I kept getting these looks, as if to say what do you expect us to do? Finally, he relented and said he would see if he could find me another seat, this was almost 5 hours later.

"""not worth the cheap prices""",1,2018-04-05,"I warn you do not fly with Air China, it's not worth the cheap prices. I normally don't give complaints because I always try to find the silver lining in situations, but I will this time. Though Air China had some of the best deals, it's only a good deal if everything goes smoothly. I ran into lots of trouble on this trip, and it ended up costing me much more than if I had flown with a more reputable company with better customer policies. I ended up paying lots of money for a very frustrating experience, not even able to take my trip after all. First of all, when I checked my E-ticket, it said the airlines was in ""Terminal I"" Once I got to Terminal 1, I found out, it was the wrong Terminal! The ""I"" of ""Terminal I"" stood for ""International."" Because of that I missed my flight. To rebook the flight, I was charged about $300. Shortly after rebooking, I found an error in my ticket. To correct the error, it cost me another $200. It also took a period of 5 hours to get all of this sorted! I was on an off the phone with them and had to call them back several times for emails they promised to send me but hadn't. I had my layover in Beijing Capital Airport. Thirty minutes after de-boarding, I realized I left my passport in the airplane seat pocket. After notifying staff (telling them my seat number too), they said they couldn't find it. (Which turned out to be false - several days afterwards, I received a call saying my passport had been found in the seat pocket) I thought they were talking to each other trying to figure out my passport situation. So that's why I followed them and once I realized what was happening, it was too late. They forced me through the security check and back onto an airplane flying back to Japan cause, ""If no passport, no be in China!"" they shouted at me. Once home, I called Air China to voice my complaint. It took about 2 hours. Rather than taking care of the problem themselves, they kept referring me to another number. In the end, I was fortunate enough to talk to a caring and reasonable agent. But they said there is little that can be done. I spent thousands of dollars, just to have 24+ hours of one frustrating experience after another. I understand that part of it was my fault but also, doesn't everyone make mistakes? I feel Air China has no mercy helping customers with their troubles; instead, seems they prey on the problems as a way to bring in more income for themselves.

I made the mistake of reading the reviews about Air China after I'd booked my flights, and I was therefore a little apprehensive about travelling with them. I'm pleased to say that my experience was quite different and I needn't have worried! The flights from London to Beijing were operated by a newer 777 aircraft and the seats were surprisingly comfortable and the aircraft interiors were clean. The Beijing to Yangon flight was operated by a 737 aircraft and the interior seemed a little tired. I'd recommend checking the aircraft type before booking as spending over 5 hours on a 737 aircraft was a little uncomfortable. In terms of onboard service I was impressed by the quantity and quality of food and drinks provided. On all legs a drinks service was followed immediately by a meal and then another drinks service. The food was quite tasty, and on one occasion I even got a cold beer (a rarity on Chinese airlines!). While onboard staff can be abrupt, there does seem to be a genuine attempt being made to be helpful and to provide good customer service. From my experience, this appears merely to be a cultural difference, rather than being rude as such. As others have mentioned, the entertainment system isn't the best, with a very limited number of both Western and Asian films. On both the outward and return legs I had 7 hour layovers in Beijing. I'd recommend that passengers bear in mind the long queues and security checks when transferring to other international flights at Beijing which took over 1 hour on this occasion. I've noticed other reviewers laying blame on Air China for this (I had exactly the same experience when transferring at Beijing with China Southern Airlines on a previous occasion). While you might be able to make it through security if you have a short connection, your luggage may not be so lucky, and it would also be extremely stressful. Based on my experiences, I'd say Air China is superior to China Southern  in terms of seat comfort, onboard service and catering; but inferior in terms of inflight entertainment and cleanliness. It's therefore a little unclear why China Southern receives such glowing reviews, and Air China receives awful reviews. It's also worth mentioning that mobile phone use is banned on all (I think) flights in China (including in flight mode). I don't think it's justified to give a bad review to a particular airline based on this, given that it's a legal requirement. I'd definitely be willing to fly Air China again.

Upon arriving in Beijing, we learned that our transfer flight to Chiang Mai, Thailand had been cancelled without prior notice and rescheduled for the following day (a full 24 hours later). I don't understand how an airline can do this without notifying their passengers in advance. This caused an immense amount of stress and anxiety in an airport where English-speaking support is limited. Finally, Air China was able to accommodate us in a hotel several hours later after we had to apply for temporary visas into China. It took 1-2 hours just to get the visa. This was a huge disappointment because it stole an entire day of our vacation in Thailand. On the way home, Air China cancelled our connecting flight in Beijing again and rescheduled us on a flight 16 hours later without letting us know in advance. However, there were 3 other flights earlier in the day going to our destination. It made no sense to me that Air China wouldn't accommodate us on one of the earlier flights. Instead they again caused a huge amount of distress by putting us on a flight 16 hours later which would mean we'd have to spend an entire day in the Beijing airport for no reason. Eventually Air China was able to accommodate us on an earlier flight but initially told us we'd need to pay $600 to move the flight.

The seat itself was identical to the economy class seat, with the exception of a different colour and generous legroom - I could stretch my legs fully without even touching the seat back in front of me! Before take-off, the cabin crew served drinks to the passengers in premium economy - a welcome service, but perhaps the standard of a premium economy class cabin, given that this was my first time flying premium economy.

Air China gave us a free night at a hotel since there were no flights available that night. It was a pretty bad hotel experience. The free stay would be nice if you came with another person, but as a solo person, you had to either share a room with a complete stranger or pay $100 for a single room. Ridiculous! When trying to reserve a room, the staff seemed very rude. They would say, ""Wait a moment."" They wouldn't specify how long I had to wait. When I asked them a third time, the guy appeared to make a number up just to shut me up. I saw another staff behind the counter playing a game on his phone.

Absolutely ridiculous and unsafe! The hotel staff were equally not accommodating or understanding, we were provided with food but were only allowed one bottle of water per person for the night.

I'm wondering how they could pass Star Alliance basic standards. First, my flight was cancelled and I had to fly one day later. Their ticket office offered me a refund or change the booking to the next day. Having no choice to come back home, I had to take the flight the day after. Regarding the check-in, I had issues on both legs. From Bangkok, the check-in is done by Thai Airways staff but they were useless. I arrived 2 hours before at the airport and almost missed my flight because they could not fix the issue. I was traveling with my wife, an infant and a child. I had requested a baby bassinet which was only done on one leg. They had the great idea to put my wife and the infant on the first row and me and my child on a different row at the back of the plane. They couldn't give us seats all together so me and my wife could take care of our baby together. I even talked to the Station Manager in Beijing on the phone but she could not care less. On the way back, it was even more ridiculous. The check-in staff was very rude. The flight was full so they upgraded my wife to premium economy but me, my infant and child in Economy. Despite asking them to downgrade my wife so we could all seat together, they refused. They said they were unable to downgrade my wife nor upgrade the rest of my family so we could all seat together. What kind of airlines would separate a family on long-haul? This happened on both legs, so I assume this happened often. During the flight, the entertainment system was mostly for Chinese as there were very few English movies. As for the food, I would advice anyone to bring some snacks on board. There were only selection of Chinese food which was simply disgusting. It was so bad that I couldn't tell what kind of meat it was. My wife and I took different dishes to spread the risk, and all of them were very bad. Last but not least, when we came back home, we had one luggage missing. I took them 4 days to bring it back and my suitcase is really damaged so I can't use it anymore.

I filed a Property Irregularity Report as soon as I landed in BKK and my checked bag was not with the rest of the people's checked bags that I flew with. They said if or when it arrived they would bring it to my hotel. It never did. My hotels were even nice enough to follow up with it everyday multiple times a day on the trip. I ended up having to buy clothes, borrow clothes, and purchase other items I had previously packed. It was the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. When the trip ended and I arrived back at BKK I let the gate agent there know the situation and she turned it over to another person, this person made some phone calls and told me I should speak to those in DC. SO I flew back to D.C. and when I got there I spoke to their baggage claim that worked for the airline. She informed me they have 21 days from the date I file the report to find my luggage (I filed it on the 10th December). Once the 21 days past if it is not found I am to file a report for compensation and it should take 2 months for them to compensate me. On 30 December 2016 I called the baggage claim office in IAD and spoke to an agent who acted completely incompetent when I started speaking to her about the issue. I told her the 21 days past so I am now seeking compensation for my lost luggage. She basically said they would keep looking for it and I asked how long do they have to look for it? An infinite amount of time? What is standard procedure? She then copied a bunch of people on an email (all of which had Gmail email address which I find absurd for a company this size and also extremely fishy) and turned it over to BKK and Beijing to handle my claim. I received a reply from one of the individuals she copied on the email in Chinese. I don't understand what about our previous correspondence indicated I speak Chinese. I had a friend translate it and he said the email was extremely unprofessional, it does not give a timeline of action or state a standard procedure.

Not largely due to anything Air China has done differently, but because I've adjusted my expectations and I've gotten better acquainted with airport and inflight regulations. The mode of operation of Air China comes across more as a hard and fast checklist, rather than keeping customers comfortable or even satisfied. I've had to be rather forceful and persistent when I make requests inflight. That way, my requests as a paying customer are usually met. The cabin crew aren't usually the most inviting or pleasant but keeping busy with the entertainment system is a good distraction. The entertainment system is decent, even on a 13 hours journey. Try your hardest to stay away from aisle seats. The aisles are narrow and you're sure to be disturbed by constant bumping from passengers and crew alike. The menu is rather limited but the meals aren't the worst- balance of flavours and sizeable servings. The seating comfort is pretty average too. I'm 6'1 and it works. Lastly, though the expectation is for the crew to be multilingual, English isn't a strong suit for all attendants. I've always used simple English and I get by. I'll continue choosing Air China because of their prices and punctuality. Yes, the service can be rather dry, but it isn't abrasive or intolerable.

I was with a travel group and the travel agent booked the trip. First of all, if you call the customer service line to pick your seat and have a meal preference, prepare to be on hold for almost an hour, pressing “1” every 7 minutes in order to stay on hold and not be disconnected and also be prepared to speak to a Chinese person that speaks little English. I had to call back 3 times and stay on hold forever before I got someone that spoke okay English. At this time I request a vegetarian meal as well and was told seat assignment and meal would be sent in a confirmation email. I never got an email. Needless to say, on the flight from Houston to Beijing, I did not have my vegetarian meal, neither did others in the group that requested one, and we all called within the time limit they request. I didn’t have a problem flying with the airline in general, until the return flight from Beijing to Houston. It was terrible enough to make me not want to fly Air China again. Another reviewer said they take your water and other drinks at the terminal before you board the plane back to Houston and they do! I was wondering what the security was doing when they came marching military style in four rows of two into the terminal (about to search bags and take drinks). I’m glad I heeded this warning. But once you get on the flight, good luck getting the flight attendants to bring you something to drink. There was a Chinese NBA players sitting behind me in economy (not joking), the whole team was on the plane, and he must have been 7 feet tall.

So I couldn’t recline my seat or try to relax for the 14 hour flight. I requested to the flight attendant if I could relocate and she actually looked at me annoyed and asked me why.  She then told me no, the flight was full (no it wasn’t). After two hours into the flight and dude behind me driving me crazy, I asked again, and she found me a seat between two older Chinese men, both hacking and spitting - if you have been to China, you know they hack and spit everywhere, and do not cover their mouths when they cough. So I declined and went exploring the plane myself. There was a man in the next section that had an entire row to himself, stretched out sleeping, so I asked the flight attendant if I could move back there. Of course they acted irritated with me and pretended not to understand what I was asking. The young man next to me spoke Mandarin, and translated what I was saying, so they had to comply. I was more relaxed, but their funky attitudes made the flight miserable. I have never had a flight attendant lean over in my face and look at me like “what?” when I requested assistance. You are not allowed to have your phone on at all, don’t even pull it out, just leave it in your carry on. But you can use other devices.

When trying to check in you are taken back to the 1960's everything takes 3 times longer than any other airline. When queuing with 5 people in front of you, it’s not - its 5 people holding 5 passports each! Then they proceed to check each person in calling them over from the other side of the airport. At this point you will have 90 minutes before checking in. Give the normal 3 hours to check in but don't expect to see duty free as it will take you 3 hours of waiting. Lastly Queuing is more like a cat fight. Don't move, don’t talk, don’t let them Push in (one nearly breaking my foot with the hard push into me).

The crew remained calm, willing to serve passengers, and tried to keep the toilets usable, the upgrade to premium economy on the Beijing to Moscow sector meant extra legroom.

"""Do not fly Air China!""",1,2016-06-04,"Copenhagen to Melbourne via Beijing. Do not fly Air China!! I flew with Air China for the first time in January 2016. The flight itself was not too bad, a bit old and dated, not the best food and the entertainment system was pretty useless (poor selection of movies/ shows, and was only working intermittently), however, nothing I can't put up with for the duration of 24 hours to get a cheap flight. My nightmare experience begun when Air China sent me a change of schedule email for my return flight, which is in July, which did not fit with when I needed to be back in Europe so I called the Australian number provided on their website, to change my ticket. Nowhere is it stated that it is a very expensive pay number, so I ran out of credit while waiting in the phone queue before I even got to talk to anyone. I somehow managed to find a free phone number which operates between 10am-5pm, but calling this number means you're connected to somewhere else in the world (they must not have an Australian office??) where conveniently enough it's always night time and no supervisors or managers are present. Dealing with the call center staff is painful as the vast majority of them are incompetent and give conflicting information, the night staff seem particularly unable to answer any questions and are generally useless. It took me six weeks and over ten calls, not to mention how much phone credit, to change my flight, and all but the last person I spoke to blamed the Beijing office. Strangely the last person I spoke to managed to change and confirm my new ticket within five minutes. She was obviously one of those rare people who actually knew what she was doing. Three weeks later I got an automated email informing me that the second leg of my return trip, Beijing-Copenhagen, had been cancelled, just like that! No information on why or what to do to get a refund - nothing!! Again I called the AU Air China call centre, was advised that I'd get a full refund because Air China was responsible for the cancellation, it would take 3-4 weeks to process though. A confirmation email was supposed to be sent to me but never arrived so I called again a few days later, they blamed my email and then proceded to tell me that the first person I had spoken to was wrong to say that I'd get a full refund- that was up to the Beijing office. Long story short, over the past 8 weeks I have spoken to five different people who have all given me different information about how much I'll be refunded and when. All of them failed to inform me of/ send me the refund form that apparently has to be filled out in order for them to start processing the refund. I only found that out yesterday when I spent $20 on a 10 minute international call to try to get hold of a supervisor or manager to complain about this ordeal. The latest news is that I will (probably) be refunded for the second leg of the flight (Beijing- Copenhagen) but not for the one from Melbourne to Beijing as that is still departing according to schedule!? So I should go to Beijing and be stuck there, or only get a partial refund? It will also take at least 7-8 weeks before any money gets paid back into my account. So for someone like me, who doesn't have a lot of money, I had to borrow money to buy a new ticket with Thai Airways so that I can get home for my holiday, I have spent way too much time and money trying to sort this out and still have to wait two months before I potentially get any money back.

Once on the plane, different story, no veggie meal, the staff was so rude and kept repeating beef or fish - no vegetarian but vegetables in the meal?

Flying Air China today felt like flying with one of the major airlines 10-15 years ago – perfectly acceptable, but these days there are much better options out there. I got an exceptionally good deal from London to Sydney via Beijing (return). The entertainment was mostly Chinese, but it’s a Chinese airline so that’s to be expected – and who doesn’t own a iPad etc these days? The food was pretty ordinary, kind of like airline food 10-15 years ago, but it did the trick. The seats were comfortable enough – in fact I don’t usually sleep too much on planes but got a fair bit of sleep on this journey. Checking in at Heathrow and Sydney was fine. And whilst Beijing airport is not great for a stopover compared to some other Asian airports, the Air China lounge made my 5 and 7 hour connections quite comfortable. The main issue I had with them was the flight crew who, whilst polite and helpful, were not as assertive with some of the passengers as they should have been. I too witnessed people sending text messages and using phone internet whilst the plane was taking off and landing. Some teenagers around me were having a pillow fight whilst we came into land at Beijing airport – no harm done, but throwing pillows around the cabin was a bit out of order. And the 4 times I landed, some passengers stood up to grab their bags almost as soon as the plane touched down. Not the flight crew’s fault, but I can imagine if it happened on Qantas or BA then one of the flight crew would have torn shreds out of these passengers. I’d definitely fly them again if I got a good deal. That being said, the only reason I flew them was the £400 return price and I would probably pay £550 if Thai/Malaysian/Cathay Pacific etc were available as an alternative.

"""passengers downright vile on this flight""",3,2015-09-11,"Air China is possibly the worst airline.  Our initial flight from New York to Tokyo went pretty smoothly, apart from the transfer security at Beijing Airport. Our return flight was awful. The first leg from Tokyo to Beijing, a flight attendant decided she didn't like me, sternly telling me no when I tried to tell her I didn't need the China customs ticket, and then passed me over for headphones among other rude behavior. This flight from Beijing to New York seemed to be off to a much better start. I had paid for upgraded seating and was excited to not have to sit in the back of the plane and be somewhere a little quieter, less turbulent, and easier to exit from, since I had to quickly exit the airport and make it home at a reasonable hour for work the next morning. While the plane rolled away for take off, a flight attendant asked us to move to the very last seats in the plane - row 62 by the tail and next to the bathrooms. The reasoning was that seat next to us had been double booked, so they upgraded that passenger to the upper deck. The new passenger in that seat was a girl of about 6 years old. The mother stood by because she had bought the three tickets spread all over the plane, but they wanted to sit together. So naturally we were asked to move. Instead of also offering us an upgrade, I got worse seats than the ones I had been assigned when I originally bought the ticket. They would not help with the refund procedure and ignored me. I spend 12 hours sleepless through turbulence (the tail end is bad, with not just shaking, but sea-like waving back and forth) children running down the aisles screaming, children crying due to turbulence, people lined up leaning on the backs of our seats for the bathroom. The bathroom constantly in use (I have never seen the cabin washrooms so consistently occupied or so disgusting), and flight attendants yelling at other passengers who were out of their seats when they were asked not to be. I've never heard a flight attendant actually ""shout"" at passengers before. They were unapologetic about making us move, although the mom did thank us, and I made zero fuss other than mentioning I paid extra for those seats and asking what I should do. I fly a lot and never experienced anything like this. I don't have high standards and I know what true economy is - the plane was nice, new and included more amenities than expected, but the service was very poor and the passengers were downright vile on this flight.

Was told that this happens quite often. No new boarding time was given so we had to sit by the gate and wait. I went to the lounge and almost missed the flight as no boarding announcements were made. Due to the delay I missed my connecting flight to Auckland so had to spend the night in Hong Kong. Air China staff told me to do the rebooking myself which I did. They gave me an hotel only till noon the following day though my flight was leaving at 7pm.

We made the reservation through a travel agent at US, we chose this airline for its shorter travel time and slightly lower price. Our transfer time in Beijing was 1h 40min. When we book the ticket, the airline told our agent it is not any issue. This is a lie. On the way to China, flight attendants told us that we need to get our baggage in Beijing and then return them for the transfer (this is fine, and we do this when we get to US). When we arrived, the help desk woman near the baggage claim said the same thing. However, we waited and waited, but our luggage never came out. We asked the attendant who supervises the baggage claim, she said they will be directly sent to the final destination. Of course, we missed our connection flight. When we went to change our flight, the Air China staff said we do not need to pick up our baggage and tried to blame this on us. Later, I found out they should have paid our lodging since this was their fault. Of course, they forgot to mention this. On the way back to US, our flight from Hefei was delayed for 24 hours. Basically, Beijing Airport did not allow any flights to get in that day. So after notifying us the flight had no departure time, no one from Air China showed up to assist or answer any questions. We were kept waiting and waiting. After sitting in the airport for 8 hours, finally two low-rank Air China staff showed up and could not solve anything. When the passengers got upset and asked to see the supervisor, one of the staff said the manager does not work on weekends, instead she got four security guards! We and two fellow passengers had international flights at Beijing, and were stuck. We called the airline help desk, they said they are not responsible for anything and cannot make any changes since we bought our tickets from an agent. If we need to change, we need to go to Beijing. Essentially, if you are not at Beijing, you are screwed in any emergency situations. Once we got to Beijing 24 hours later, the staff at the counter were rude, unsympathetic, and unorganized. There were so many passengers who missed flights, and Air China had only 2 staff members to deal with the passengers. If you do not insist on them providing a solution, they just brush you aside. We had to stand before them for 2 hours before it can be finally resolved. Overall, if you could, do not take Air China, the service for emergencies such as delay, particular in any other cities, is non-existing.

However, service onboard was horrible. The flight attendant barely spoke English, and when she asked what I wanted for dinner, I didn't understand half the choices. There was no printed menu, so I had to make a choice based on what little words I were able to grab from the flight attendant. The food was okay. There were maybe 5 dishes that were mostly good, except for the main dish which was some type of meat that didn't taste good. I didn't get a wine list at any point. The entertainment system was ok, but not that many choices in terms of US films and shows. And the ones available had Chinese subtitles that you couldn't turn off. And before each title started there were long commercials. After the flight attendant turned my seat into a comfy bed, I didn't see her for the next 8 hours or so. She didn't set foot in the cabin. So no way to order more drinks or snacks. And there was no bar or lounge area. I saw the flight attendant again maybe an hour before landing when it was time for breakfast.

Air China customer review,1,2015-07-30,"When we arrived at Beijing airport at 10:30 pm to check in for our flight to Paris we were told that the flight was delayed to 5:50 in the morning due to thunderstorm. I couldn't believe that as we had previously flown in much worse weather. It wasn't even raining but I won't argue with the decision Air China made as safety is a priority. We were already so tired and we weren't happy as our return flight to Korea with Air China had already been rescheduled inconveniently. It was very hard to access to the wifi at the airport so It was very difficult to change our pick up arrangements to accommodate the late arrival in Paris. I asked the Air China Duty manager at the check in desk to let us stay at the hourly hotel in the airport for a couple of hours as we were tired and a shower was needed considering the humid Beijing weather. I am very unhappy with how we were dealt with. One of the duty managers told us he understood how annoying the situation was for us. Furthermore, He said he would do anything he could for us so I requested the hourly hotel and he made a phone call. After he was on the phone for a short time he said, unfortunately, there were no rooms available . As much as we were frustrated and annoyed, I thought he couldn't really do anything more for us at that time. I asked him if he could put us on the waiting list for a room at least, so if any rooms became available we could get one. He said that wasn't a problem and he said our names were on the list. Although we were tired and frustrated we had no idea he was lying to us so we were quite polite and cooperative, I wish I grabbed his name at that time as we later discovered almost everything he told us was a lie. After we went through customs and security we headed to the hourly hotel as I wanted to double-check our names were actually on the waiting list. They informed us that there was no list as they had plenty of rooms available for us if we were willing to pay. We explained to the hotel attendant what we had been told and his response was that Air China said they were not willing to pay for it. With the help of the hotel attendant we tried to call the Air China Duty Manager but of course he wouldn't answer the phone. I also called the customer service desk of Air china and finally got through to somebody after several attempts and considerable time on hold. The lady told me that she couldn't help because I chose English therefore the line went through to LA Air China so that she couldn't help us. I don't know where to begin to complain about this situation. The way we were dealt with is totally unacceptable. First of all, how the manager lied to our faces like that I still can not believe he thinks he can do that to customers. I have never seen anyone so unprofessional and dishonest when representing a big company. If customer service is only for Chinese speaking people and English speakers only get a dummy speaker and they can't actually help anyone with the problems, they might as well be up front about it.

Despite the many negative reviews about Air China economy class, the fare was too good to travel with another airline. Overall, the experience wasn't too bad. We booked via an online travel agent, so were unable to select our seats online, but it wasn't a problem to contact the Air China customer service team and have our seat selections noted. The seat pitch was the same as most other economy class flights, although the foot rest on each seat was made for smaller people so it restricted leg room when raised. The crew didn't speak much English, but they knew enough to get by, and the in flight announcements were understandable. The inflight entertainment selection didn't have a lot of English language options, and was very limited overall when compared with airlines like Emirates.

Air China customer review,7,2015-06-11,The seats and leg room was serviceable. The only thing about the staff that was a concern was most of them spoke basic English. The entertainment also was very biased. For a 13 hour flight their content generally catered only to Chinese people. Luckily I spent most of that time sleeping so it didn't matter. The meal options were limited but the food wasn't bad. The only think I will warn is that if you're on a long flight and you don't like Chinese food don't take this flight because that's what you'll be served throughout the entirety of the flight.

Crew tried to speak the menu options but their English language skills aren't up to the task-just give us the menu please.

A neighboring passenger had the same reaction as mine when they requested vegetarian food and like me they didn't touch the food that was served. We were starving throughout the nearly 24 hour flight time from LA to Delhi. The in-flight entertainment too left much to be desired. It was dated poor selection and you really had to struggle with the seat-consoles to get them to display what you want. Horrible experience overall but luckily they didn't lose my luggage.

Air China customer review,6,2015-04-16,LHR-PEK r/t in First Class. Used miles for this trip as CA First was 75000 vs 100000 for VS Upper Class to PVG. Overall it was OK. As a Star Alliance carrier we used United First lounge at LHR T2. 777 was clean/new bed and pyjamas comfortable amenity kit akin to US carriers' international Business class. Food was pretty average (JAL economy on subsequent flight was better tasting) wine list ok but limited whisky etc. I avoided the instant coffee. Cabin nice and quiet only 4 pax in First both ways. Glad we weren't in fully-crammed Business class. Staff on LHR-PEK were decent but hard to get a smile return from PEK-LHR food was much better and FAs much friendlier. As others have noted IFE is on-demand but somewhat limited English options. I know it's Air China but they should take a page from other Asian airlines e.g. JAL who have tons of international film/TV options. First Class lounge in Beijing is pretty poor: self-serve bar but no ice or lemon etc so don't even bother trying to make a gin & tonic just pour yourself a glass of warm white Chinese wine and whimper in a corner. Beijing Capital Airport is a beautiful Norman Foster building but don't ever transit internationally in Beijing. Unlike pretty much every airport on Earth you have to go through Chinese immigration just for connecting flights (it's a separate queue but still). We had a full two hour connection and spent nearly 1h45m just waiting to get the passport stamp to then go straight back through security. Incredibly inefficient and infuriating. No special/fast track for First class and no staff seemed to care that the delays were making everyone miss their long-haul connections. On balance CA First is slightly better than BA Club but below VS Upper Class. However for 25k fewer miles than VS to Asia it felt like a fair trade.

Bring your drinks on board because they only offer Pepsi Seven Up and Water. Do not drink the coffee its horrible. The offer me dinner that I had to leave intact because it has very bad appearance for a western guy like me. I saw everyone eating it but not me. In my opinion they are following very close to UA were economy is just a Low cost carrier offer with very bad international and domestic service.

First of all there is a woeful lack of understandable English. The inflight announcements challenge the imagination. Secondly the handsome menu suggests a pleasant dining experience that does not materialize. (On our outbound flight there were no menus so the flight attendants brought out the frozen dinners and peeled back to foil so we could guess what we were to have.) Drinks are not offered before dinner rather with dinner with no offer of a refill.

Air China customer review,1,2015-04-10,We flew from London to Beijing leaving only an hour in between to catch the next flight from Beijing to Macau. The computers were down and I was unable to check in online several times. At Heathrow a glitch in the system meant that our luggage could not go to Macau but we had to pick up our bags at Beijing and check in again to resume our journey. As predicted our luggage was not on the carousel. We went to Lost and Found where several staff just stand and chat. With less than 30 minutes to board our flight we were still without bags. Thankfully the lady at check-in (who did speak English and showed compassion) organised our connection located our luggage and had it transferred. On the return journey a week later the flight was delayed which meant that we did miss our plane to London. Air China organised an overnight stay. At Beijing airport we got to the check in desk to collect boarding passes. One would imagine that the person manning the London flights would have some command of the English language. This person did not speak nor comprehend a word of English. Both times we did not receive our requested vegetarian meals and were abruptly given bread rolls as a substitute. The seats are cramped and offer little leg room in economy class. The meals are unimaginative. The only good thing I can say is that soft drinks were available on request.

I can say that the quality of the airline compared to other Star Alliance members is very poor (comparing staff food seat comfort and entertainment). When I got on the flight I found a plastic knife in my seat left over from the previous flight. This was fine and I started to settle in for the flight. After the safety video and taxiing we were informed there was an issue with the plane. We stayed on the tarmac for around an hour then we all gathered our things and were bussed back to the terminal. Once there there was very little communication. Eventually our flight did go around 6 hours later. My major points with the airline: Very few staff members spoke English and those who did had communication level. Staff members also gave conflicting information about the delayed flight and were unable to answer most questions in English. All major communications were given in English but it was broken and often very confusing. Inflight the staff were not very friendly would barely make eye contact. Inflight meals were poor. The second meal they gave two options I chose the chicken option and it turned out to be the exact same meal they had served earlier. Inflight video quality is poor and screens cannot be dimmed which makes watching movies overnight very hard on the eyes.

Seats for YVR-PEK return was selected at booking time however when confirming flight info of trip at later date no seats assigned as there was a change in aircraft - this resulted in having seats in less desirable area of the aircraft. Confirmation was obtained regarding return flight info for departure time and seat assignment. The outgoing flight to Bangkok was on schedule. In cabin service was fair - they did not go out of their way to offer water or snacks on a 13+ hour flight - passengers had to serve themselves the majority of the time. Meals offered were edible. Return flight from Bangkok was a complete nightmare. Arrived at Bangkok airport at 4am for a 6.10 am scheduled flight to Beijing - no listing of flight - it took over an hour to find someone who eventually advised us that the flight had been rescheduled to 1.50 am that morning and that we missed our flight. Advised that we would have to deal with Air China rep who will show up around 11.45 am to check in passengers for a 2.20 pm flight. Attempts were made to make contact with Air China in North America and Beijing - no success 7+ hours later the ticket wicket opens however no Air China rep shows up until numerous requests were made. Another hour goes by before boarding passes are issued for BKK-PEK. Required to fly standby for the remainder of the trip which resulted in an overnight stay in Beijing. Attempt to obtain boarding passes for PEK-PVR and was advised we missed our flight>had to explain the whole scenario again - after 45 min boarding passes were issued and advised we have no seats from YVR-YEG and will probably have to overnight again. Client service provided in YVR was excellent ticket agent met us at the gate upon arrival and ushered us through customs and to the Air Canada kiosk for the issuance of the final boarding pass to YEG.

I couldn't seem to check-in online prior to my flight but check-in at the airport and boarding all went smoothly. The planes were clean and comfortable enough and the flight attendants regularly offered drinks including beer and wine. Although there was not a huge range there were a few decent films and TV shows to choose from for the in-flight entertainment. I had downloaded plenty of programmes to watch on my iPad anyway and I'm pleased I did. The flight attendants were polite and helpful. There was a bit of a language barrier but their English was good enough to get by without much difficulty. The food was a bit hit and miss (some of it I couldn't eat and I'm not usually a fussy eater) so I'd suggest taking some snacks.

Nothing was communicated by the airline the time just mysteriously changed from 14.30 to 16.10. When the staff were asked about it they either pretended to not speak English or just didn't. No apology was issued on the flight. The plane was sitting at the gate for hours before the flight was due to take off so no excuses there. We already had an 8 hour stopover so the extra couple of hours wasn't welcome when our total journey time was already 30+ hours.

Crew did not check safety measures appropriately: a passenger sitting next to me was using his mobile before take off and it took 3 crew members instructions before he finally switched it off - but they failed to tell him to put his bag in the overhead locker. The bag was on his lap disguising the fact that he was not wearing his seat belt. I asked him to put his seat belt on and his comment was ""relax"". Same thing happened on landing - they didn't check his seat belt. A friend who was seated in a bulkhead seat said a bag was in front of her on the floor during take off and landing. I had to completely unpack my case at check in because the scanner at check in had identified something (it was the plug of my travel kettle!). Check in staff were most unhelpful and officious. We were so glad that our international flights were with BA and not AC. In flight beverages on these short flights compared unfavourably with Shanghai and Capital Airlines. There's a lot of choice for internal flights so I would not recommend anyone flies with AC when there are better options available.",False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,,False
Air China customer review,5,2014-11-20,Washington Dulles to Beijing and on to Manila and return in Oct-Nov 2014. This was the most economical flight that I could find and I did not expect great seat comfort or great quality food. The boarding in Dulles was a mess. The majority of people on the plane were Chinese and non English speakers who queued up to board when there was some indication we would soon be boarding. The ground staff announced in English that we would be boarding from the rear of he plane and started to announce a range of rows. The people who had gotten in line saw people from the rear rows trying to board and started pushing to board because they thought people were cutting in line. The ground staff started yelling to stop pushing again in English. The ground staff finally got a Chinese speaker to make an announcement and restore some order.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,,False
Air China customer review,3,2014-11-12,Heathrow to Beijing Beijing to Singapore and then back via same route. All planes were on time and embarkation was efficient. The Singapore legs used clean new planes with excellent entertainment systems. The longer London legs were both on a very old plane. It was clean but decidedly tatty. The food on all legs was unappetising and fell well short of any other airline food that I have ever had. Cold drinks were offered but we had to work hard to get anything other than orange juice or apple juice. There was very limited wine and my requests for tea or coffee were met from the trolley but not graciously. All of the above were not deal breakers but the following are - the old London-Beijing planes were very uncomfortable. The seats were old and tatty and the entertainment system was atrocious. If it worked it was extremely complicated and mine didn't work at all on the outbound leg. To add insult to injury a black box linked to the entertainment system was placed under the seat in front of you and this severely limited leg room and forced anybody with normal length legs to sit on a twist. The Singapore plane was more comfortable so would be put to far better use on the longer flight to London as ten hours is far to long to sit in a crooked seat on a tatty old plane. The cabin staff were very task orientated and not people focused. I didn't find them friendly and they were uncomfortably cold.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,,False

We had excellent service on the Singapore to Beijing portion but the Chinese foreign minister was on the same flight. Otherwise the service was efficient and the food was very presentable without being spectacular. Seat was fantastic and the full flat seats a joy to use.

Air China customer review,2,2014-10-31,Flying CA regularly. Mostly FRA-PEK-CGQ. One of the worst Star-Alliance airlines. Especially frustrating is the absolutely abominable call center and ground staff - they do not only convey a lack of interest into their customers they are simply incompetent when it comes to handling delayed passengers or flight rebooking. The airline's website is a joke (booking flights there often doesn't work at all or is as complicated as applying for a tax refund). Flight experience itself - there have been improvements over the years but only gradually. The food for example is still one of the worst you can get. All in all - only fly Air China as long as you can get hold of a very cheap ticket and you're very patient when it comes to finding staff willing to help you when you're delayed or want to change something regarding your booking.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,2,,,False
Air China customer review,7,2014-10-05,Very pleasant business class flight on Air China from Beijing to Houston on gleaming 777-300. The highlight is the seat. It creates a very comfortable lie-flat bed and comes with a large fluffy duvet and large pillow - making for very restful sleep. Cabin crew was friendly attentive and hard-working albeit robotic programmed and not proactive in responding to passenger needs/desires. Food was decent - about average for international business class. Wine list was decent too but crew served white wine and champagne warm. We had to constantly ask for refills of wine and water in very small glasses. Air China would do well to learn the fine points of premium service from Star Alliance partner Asiana. Inflight entertainment had handful of American movies/TV but an understandably heavy emphasis on Chinese entertainment offerings.

After reading so many negative reviews my expectations were very low and I was dreading the experience as I had never flew business class before apart from Jetstar business. Having said this we were pleasantly surprised at the service food and the cabin. Both flights were without a doubt the best trip I've had. Comfortable beds totally lie flat in Airbus around 30 in business class so it was extremely quiet and personal. Toilets were always clean FA were attentive whilst they may have had difficult in speaking fluent English we got by. Inflight entertainment was the only drawback in terms of selection not up to date movies but nonetheless there was something you could see. As this was a night trip I enjoyed the sleeping arrangement more. We had a layover in Beijing to break the trip. The other leg to London plane was newer and business class had about 80 people so I think the attentiveness from FA was a little less but that's understandable again food bed and toilets were great.

The toilets on each flight were not clean when I got on the flight nor were they cleaned during the flight. No Movies on demand. The air hostess doing the English announcements was impossible to understand. Wanted us to buy duty free but there were no duty free brochure in the seat pocket on any sector.

Air China customer review,5,2014-09-24,"CA 1330 CAN-PEK (Sunday at 10.30am departure). CA is not my go-to carrier because they are priced higher on average and they don't have much flight time options for this route comparing to China Southern. Unless someone pays for your flights this under 3 hour-ish flight usually can just get away with economy seats because it is too short to enjoy anything premium. I got a half-priced business class deal this time so I tried it. Overall: I think it really did not mean much unless you are saving up miles with them. The word ""lukewarm"" can summarize my entire experience from the lounge service (staff) to the in-flight lunch (room-temp un-appealing Asian dish) that was served 60 minutes before landing - imagine how they ushered me to finish the meal within 15 minutes. No friendly name calls like United (they don't even greet you by name) and they skipped me for drinks and hand towels because I took a nap. I suppose I need to be alert the entire time to be adequate enough for serving?

In addition horrible food (tasteless boiled shrimps on rice no dessert) champagne without bubbles (bottle must have been opened many times and kept warm). Only highlights: decent toilet kit friendly attendants good schedule for connecting flights from Beijing (only reason for me to take this flight.

Air China customer review,7,2014-08-05,ICN-PEK-HKG and back to ICN in economy. All flights on widebody A330 except PEK-HKG on narrow A321. All of the planes were of different quality. Some had new seats some had old seats some had seatback entertainment on demand (others on loop). Planes showed a little age but nothing worrisome. Onboard product varied greatly. Many delays due to ATC in Beijing. That meant maybe 30 mins to 1 hr of just waiting to take off for a gate you name it. The cabin crew and pilots did their best to keep everyone informed though. The cabin crew was polite and welcoming. As they were short flights I never had to ask for anything. They spoke basic English but oddly on ICN-PEK and return only one attendant spoke Korean over the PA only (pax about 50/49 Chinese/Korean and 1% Westerner). Airline food is not supposed to be gourmet in economy but Air China's food was completely inedible. Dry noodles that stuck together no sauce no flavor just horrible. Normally I can eat all of my food but I definitely just left it untouched. All flights were short (under 3 hours) so the seat was comfortable and didn't cause any problems. AVOD selection was limited to perhaps one or two recent western movies some really old western movies and lots and lots of Chinese selections. The price was right for this trip (500 USD) at peak vacation time in Korea. We only had one layover in PEK on the return to ICN. It was quick and painless.

In-flight entertainment was also good with a variety of options available on the system. However I rather dislike how they don't allow the option of choosing a seat when making the flight booking as I ended up in the exit row right in front of the lavatory.

Air China customer review,9,2014-07-29,"We flew from Houston to Beijing in Biz Class - then First Class on the return. There were a few of the attendants that had language barriers but that did not effect the trip whatsoever. The food was good - not great. Although the duck coming back from Beijing was great - but there were only a few servings of that available. The wine selection was okay - and the movie selection was fine. The GPS/Mapping system was fun to watch as we went over the arctic circle. End of day the business class seats were great - my wife was able to sleep most of the trip there and back. I had a harder time in business class being 6'5"" - I was able to stretch out straight but my feet were at a 90 degree angle b/c of seat in front - since I laid on my side most of the time it really wasn't an issue except for when I wanted to stretch out. This wasn't an issue in first on way back. Our boys were in economy and I took water bottle back to them - that was a different world back there but they appreciated the water. (A lot of the windows were ""open"" and it was quite a bit noisier in economy - not surprising but it was a bit of a shock going from the dark quiet of biz class to economy). We did read one review that mentioned how hot the plane was in Houston b/f takeoff. We experienced the same thing. I don't think they lease the A/C equipment at the airport or something like that - b/c we didn't have that problem in Hong Kong or Beijing - and both of those planes were on the tarmac during the heat of the day (Houston flight was at 1am).

Air China customer review,7,2013-12-11,"PUS-PEK in a B737-800. Plane not new but clean and inviting. Departure on time (also due to generous turnaround time in Busan) arrival in Beijing ahead of schedule. Flight not fully booked thus our middle seat fortunately was left empty and provided some extra comfort. As in many Asian airlines the announcements in English were too low and mostly incomprehensible certainly a risk for emergency situations although you rely on the fact that this is not your first flight and you know the ""rules"". Lunch was served on this flight of almost two hours two standard options decent food - absolutely ok for economy class. The Chinese (white) wine they served is strange to European palate but you almost feel like Robert Parker and keep tasting and discovering. Overall impression of the crew was positive: polite and efficient not eager to talk. Limited IFE with overhead screens just the usual equipment in a 738 of about five years of age sufficient for a short haul trip.",False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,,True
Air China customer review,2,2013-12-02,I travelled from Beijing (PEK) to Houston (IAH) on 12/1/13. There were a few points that made this trip poor: 1) The PA system was nearly indecipherable most of the time. When the flight attendant would speak the PA system had a lot of feedback and echos and you could not hear what was being said. This could be a safety issue in an emergency. 2) Our main flight attendant was very rude. She rolled her eyes anytime she was asked a question (ie asking for more tea asking to take tray etc). I had a cold I was getting over and needed some water. I asked her for a bottle that was half full that I could keep with me and she refused again rolling her eyes. (We couldn't bring water bottles on board.) 3) My husband is ethnically Chinese but born in the US and speaks no Chinese. When the flight attendant spoke to him in Chinese he said he did not understand Chinese so she simply raised her voice and said it again rolled her eyes and walked away. Overall the crew was not helpful especially rude to foreigners and unpleasant.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,,False

It is cheap and that explains everything bad service bad food old planes and non existent IFE. There was no inflight entertainment between PEK and DEL. Soon after the meal they shove a wrapped sandwich in your hand as a snack for later on. Air China did it to us twice and it is a common practice as we found out from other people that they cancel or delay a flight and pile up passengers in one plane. The result is chaos in PEK. I fly frequently and my experience was the worst. First time I flew with them because of price and second time because I had to book a seat very late and could not find another airline.

This would have been a lot more believable if we hadn't seen several other flights to Beijing depart during the same period. I know flights are going to be delayed especially into and out of Beijing but the airlines need to be straight with us about what was happening.

My decision was justified. Bangkok to JFK leg was not as bad as I expected but the food quality service and entertainment were substandard when measured against other Star Alliance carriers. (I am a Star Alliance Gold Member). The nightmare was the return trip. Upon arriving to JFK I was informed that I would miss my connection from Beijing to Bangkok because the flight was delayed and I was ticketed on the next available flight which required me spending the night in Beijing at Air China's expenses. When I landed there was no CA agent at the gate to help direct you. Second the transfer desk personnel could not provide clear instructions of what to do and several of us spent 1.5 hrs going through a maze trying to find someone who could direct us properly.

Arrived in Beijing flight to Frankfurt was fully booked and there were no more flights available that day. Queued at the ticketing counter for 2 hours and had a new route: Beijing - London - Munich having the last part of the journey by Lufthansa. After issuing hand written paper tickets we spent another 2 hours waiting for baggage and shuttle bus to hotel. Spent one night in Beijing and the next day we finally took off to London. Long distance flight was ok: flight attendants don't really know the meaning of customer service and the food was reflecting Chinese cuisine very poorly. In London we were not booked onto the flight to Munich! The lady at the ticketing counter in London was very understanding (Lufthansa) and she put us on to the next flight to Munich.

Return was non-stop as advertised. Really not enough legroom for a long-haul. Crew were polite but not friendly. Flight was smooth but fasten seatbelts was on most of the time as the pilot announced (non-existent) turbulence.

Air China customer review,7,2013-08-06,MEL-PVG-LHR-PEK-PVG-MELin J Class. PVG-LHR was code-share using Virgin so won't comment on that. CA178 was my first long-haul with CA. Mostly it was a pleasant trip with good service. A330 was in good condition. A few scuff marks at feet level. Bathrooms were clean throughout. Captain spoke excellent English and FA announcements were clear English. Requests to FAs were mostly understood. Service when the call button was pressed was very prompt. Meals were fine. Presentation was a bit naff but food OK. The seat was good the design made me think of J in Lufthansa. I worked the whole trip so didn't try it as a bed. Access to the power point and headphone socket was fiddly under an armrest. The overhead light was not accurately aimed at the table. Amenity pack was OK. Mostly working so not much time for AVOD. Video feed quality was excellent. Headphones not noise cancelling but adequate. LHR-PEK - Departed on time. Good quality pyjamas provided and the bed comfortable. Blanket a bit on the small size. Meal service was fine. Choice of movies was OK. Headphones were very good with noise cancellation. PEK-MEL - First time trying PEK as a transit. Not good. Arrived in T3. After walking about a kilometre reached the transit desk. Half an hour later I was through. Had to take the train then finally get to the domestic lounge. Was called to the gate but stood for 45 minutes waiting for the bus to the plane. Plane to Melbourne was via Pudong. Lunch was OK then arrived at PVG. A man with a flag rounded up all the MEL pax and herded us to the baggage claim area then to immigration. Bit of a queue there. So after about a 750m walk arrived back at the same gate same plane. All in all I came away with perception of 4 star service for the air portion. 2 stars for the transit service at PEK maybe 2.5 stars for transit at PVG.

Check-in at CDG was smooth and Air China own staff greeted each first class passenger and was escorted to the passport check area. The star alliance lounge has friendly staff but pathetic choice of food and tired facilities. On board the seat was comfortable and turned into a bed. It was however like a Turkish Airlines long haul business class seat but with more privacy. Male flight attendant was very kind and nice but definitely needs a touch up on grooming while female flight attendants were immaculate in grooming but need a brush up on service skills. Bizarre meal combination with Chinese spicy chicken and prawn served with Risotto. Whole service lacks refinement and sophistication of other airlines but very efficient. Return check in at Pudong was fast and friendly. Did not have time to visit their lounge. Flight was operated by an old A330 but still with a seat that turns into a full flat bed. Did not eat and slept for a good 8 hours. Cabin crew on this sector were all attentive and very friendly. English did not seem to be a problem on the flights I took as others experienced.

Air China customer review,6,2013-07-22,PEK-LHR checked in early and got a window seat. Security at T3 something of a nightmare each checkpoint (of which there are about twenty) has it's own line which pass through a barrier and when joining the line it's impossible to see but every other checkpoint is staggered so the checkpoint might be just on the other side of the barrier in which case there are about five people ahead of you or it's much further away in which case there are thirty people ahead of you and the difference is worth about an extra twenty minutes. One last complaint about the airport at least in summer - it's incredibly hot so despite preparing for comfort on a long flight one always boards sweaty and uncomfortable which is rather awful. The route has been upgraded in July to a Boeing 777-300ER. Boarding smooth with a final security check in the jetbridge reducing congestion at the aircraft door. Every seat was filled except the one separating me from my neighbour which was lucky. Pushed on time and made a smooth takeoff and climb. Meal service was tasty and hot chinese seafood and noodles. Air China still have one terrible habit of (even on a daylight flight) insisting - at times rudely - that all window blinds are closed. Why on earth is this? It's an all-day flight that arrives late afternoon a lot of sleep in flight is actually quite counterproductive to beating jetlag. I opened it an inch to enjoy the sights of Russia enough to see out but not enough to incur the wrath of the cabin crew who were kind and laid-back on every other issue - top up a drink? an extra bread roll? no problem. Want to look out the window on a daylight flight? I enjoyed the excellent on- demand entertainment options which included plenty of first-rate western movies. Second meal service was another tasty hot meal as we left Russian airspace. Landed on time at Heathrow. Baggage claim was pretty quick.

I liked was the super fast removal of food trays. Beijing International Airport is huge and with less than 2 hrs to catch our connecting flight proved stressful.

On arrival at Hong Kong in the early afternoon one of our bags had not been put on our flight but fortunately delivered to our Hotel later that evening.

There was no English entertainment onboard - only Chinese. In addition the Chinese entertainment was available for about max 3 hours of the total 14 hours travel time. They also tell you in advance there is limited selection of food if they run out please accept their apology. The seat size itself is fine so is the overall travel. However do not travel with them if you are on a tight time frame as very likely not able to catch your next flight.

Air China customer review,2,2013-06-16,CA 948 Delhi - Beijing Seat 12 L CA 985 Beijing - San Francisco Seat 82C 13th June. Business Class between Delhi and San Francisco. Some of the worst and oldest aircraft's are being used on this route. Airbus from Delhi to Beijing had very worn out toilets and the toilet bowl did not even flush properly. The 747-400 on the Beijing - San Francisco route was more than 14 years old no 170 deg recline this is an old J class seat with many of the seat reclining and extension systems not working. Recline is partial and at least 2 of the functions on my seat (82 C) were not working. The lower panel on my seat was falling off and lying on the floor.

Air China customer review,1,2013-06-10,Flight from Sydney to Beijing cancelled and changed to a different day without explanation. On the flight itself the service was cold and abrupt. My biggest complaint about this flight were my uncivilised fellow passengers. One lady cut in front of me in the queue during check in. Later in the flight I produced my phone / tablet (which was in flight mode) to check the time. I now realise I shouldn't have but the guy sitting beside me became aggressive in an animated fashion. I requested a move which the cabin staff to their credit quickly agreed to. Their English was extremely poor. I flew a total of four 8+ hour flights with the airline in the past month (Sydney - Beijing - Frankfurt - Shanghai - Sydney). The food was variable ranging from quite poor to somewhat edible and the Chinese red wine was sour and undrinkable. My main issue was uncivilised fellow travellers - I almost lost count of the amount of times I was pushed / shoved or cut in front of in queues during this experience. In addition when transferring through Shanghai I had to collect my luggage and re-check in mid way - they could not transfer my luggage directly from Frankfurt to Sydney. This was an unpleasant way to travel and I would not recommend the airline. You get what you pay for and if you do chose Air China be prepared for extra irritations and inconveniences.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,,False
Air China customer review,,2013-06-04,CA429 Chengdu to Mumbai on 2013-06-02. I did not get any food to eat as they only had fish meals. FA's were rude and did not help to find an alternative meal for me. The beer was warm the toilets were dirty from the start of the flight and in shabby condition. The overhead TV screen showed the same Chinese documentary 3 times and a Chinese film both in Mandarin subtitles. Finally coming in to land in Mumbai a 1 minute clip of Beijing airport was shown over and over again till landing. I will never travel this airline again.

Air China customer review,1,2013-06-03,SYD-PEK-GAT flight sold as a single stop. Only after further enquiries (after purchase) did I find that there was a technical stop in Shanghai. 40 minute stop was taken and little to no information was given to passengers. Did we have to clear customs and then come back in? Yes we did. We were not told. It took me about 70 minutes to get back to the gate. After this we sat on the tarmac for a while. Initially the blame was levelled at tardy passengers that meant we lost our place in the queue. Then the weather. This is while other aircraft were taking off and landing. Of course the delay meant we missed our connecting flight. Again information had to be squeezed out of the staff. The layover was at a local hotel. We did not know we were being rescheduled until 5 minutes before being ushered onto the bus. Still no replacement flight had been communicated to us. I am currently awaiting the check in to open for the rescheduled flight.

I recall when dinner was being served the FA asked me whether we would like Chicken or Seafood. I told her ""can we have 1 chicken and 1 seafood please"". She paused for a second and gave me a confused look and responded ""We have Chicken with potato or Seafood with rice""! I had to say it 3 times before she understood. On the long haul flight both times I had no choice on the dinner as by the time the FA came to me there was only one choice of meal left. All the beer was finished before dinner was served.

Air China customer review,7,2013-05-19,SYD-PEK-SYD in Business Class. Travelling for work all I really want is the cheapest business class seat that I can find for overnight flights to China there are few options reasonably priced. Air China's offering on A330 equipment is an older style seat but is virtually flat and with plenty of space. It was set quite low to the ground so was easy to hop over the person adjacent when going to the toilet. Food below average for business class and AVOD was limited with mostly older films. Didn't really matter too much when I slept most of the 11.5hrs each way. Flight crew were efficient and polite but characterless.

Service was very good and food quite on par with my other usual choices when flying to China including UA OZ and AC. Overall if I was flying business class I would choose Air China again if the time and price was right. My return flight in PEK-LAX was in economy. Again 777-300 hard product (seat) which includes in-seat power plug for your laptop was quite good but the seat pitch was borderline acceptable. The IFE system is good AVOD but lacks enough current Western content. That aside I would not recommend Air China economy to anyone because of the quality of the food.

Air China customer review,9,2013-04-21,PEK-LAX. New 777-300ER was completely full a very young crowd so much excitement during boarding. Once underway the passengers were very well-behaved. Crew reasonably friendly and immaculately presented. Two hot meals - one soon after takeoff and another about 5 hours before landing. After the second hot meal sandwiches were distributed for passengers to snack on for the remainder of the flight. Entertainment was a good selection of movies on individual screens. Pushed on time to the minute and landed forty mins late due to headwinds. Only complaint is almost all pax on Air China are Chinese and hence all have visas which means each pax takes longer for US immigration - which can be interminable at the best of times - will take an hour unless you're one of the first off the plane. For me it took 1h20m to clear immigration which was also the case when I flew the airline PEK-LAX last year.

HKG-PEK arrived on time while PEK-SVO delays 4 hour because of waiting for transfer passenger (not sure if it is the real reason) but CA distributed foods and drinks to us with no extra cost. Compare to unfriendly cabin crew on Air China I have seen before cabin crew on these two flights were friendly and attentive with limited English ability on both segments. I found my no-lactose special meal tasteless and asked for another regular one which was tasty and good. Seat on B777 PEK-SVO is very comfortable with good recline. No IFE on both segments.

Upon boarding we both noticed that the FA’s were very nice and extremely helpful to us. Aircraft was either new or had been refurbished because everything was spotless.

The attendants were polite and pleasant and all spoke English. The food was lovely and more than enough to fill you up with drinks at regular intervals. And if that wasn't enough you just press the button and ask for more. Toilets were as clean as you can expect from 300 people all using the same few loos. But after almost every one went in an attendant followed to clean up and replace loo roll etc. Space between seats was more than ample with at least 10 inches between your knees and the seat in front and even when the person in front put their seat back the seat wasn't right in your face.

However expect the 0155 from Beijing to Gatwick to be delayed as I have looked at its departure time for the past couple of months and it leaves late often very late each time.

For lunch they offer a choice of 4 main courses plus a 'daily special selection'. All food is served on one large tray separate serving of appetizers etc. would probably be too time consuming. Quantity and quality fully acceptable so is the presentation and the cabin crews general service standard. In beverages Air China highlights a choice of 7 different teas 4 coffees.

She recommended I contact Complaints and gave me a phone number that was out of service. Shanghai Pudong staff didn't even have a complaints protocol didn't care. My seat in disrepair - mine was slanted downward meaning that I couldn't relax without slipping into the footwell. Flight came in to Frankfurt late - they didn't advise about coming in late until just before landing when I found out I was missing my connection.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,,False
Air China customer review,4,2013-01-02,Flew to Bangkok from New York via Beijing in business class December 25 2012. Flight from JFK to PEK was on an older 747.

Air China customer review,8,2012-12-31,LGW-MEL via Beijing and Shanghai. Visa for Australia sorted out by Air China staff at check in after problems arose. Flights on time and all went well. Uncomfortable wait in Beijing for 9 hrs with little comfort before next flight. Can't understand why we were moved through immigration and around airport terminals to find out that the next flight was from the next airline bay! Planes were good conditioned airbus 330s food was good with choice every time plenty of fluids passed out by staff. Seat comfort onboard to Australia uncomfortable but better on return.

Air China customer review,5,2012-12-28,Hong Kong to Beijing. Wanted to fly Hong Kong to Toronto direct but booked flights with points and this routing was the only one available. Aircraft was an old and tired Boeing 777. A bit dirty around the seat area. We flew business and my foot rest was broken and could not be adjusted by the power button. When the seat in front was in the full recline position it encroached onto my space quite a bit. Flight was set for 2.20pm and it left on time and arrived in Beijing 15 minutes early good for me as I had a rather tight connection. The snack was a salad and fried rice. Food was just barely adequate which I didn't finish. Flight attendants spoke some English enough to get by. Would not choose this airline unless I have no choice.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,4,,,,,,False
Air China customer review,7,2012-12-20,HKG-PEK-NRT 12/12/12. First flight A321 cabin crew excellent although the English speaking FA had a very heavy accent which made it a little difficult to understand her. Service very attentive they actually opened the slippers and blanket pouches for you. Meal service came and they opened the tray tables for you. Breakfast however was watery eggs tasteless chicken sausage and spinach. In the past I have always found catering from HKG to be excellent but this was far from what is usual. Transit in Beijing was good arrived and departed from hard stands business class passengers had their own minibus to take them to and from the terminal. However transit in PEK meant going through an immigration check and there was only one open desk which the immigration officer took 10 mins or more on the passengers ahead of me on line. PEK to NRT on 738 with only 8 seats. Catering was sub par the steak was overcooked and the appetizers were brown tofu and dried fish. Again though the cabin crew were excellent.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,,True

Friendly and welcoming service (with reasonable English skills) and very comfy lie-flat seating including a warm cotton duvet and good sized pillow. 2-2-2 seating 'angled' including a large screen with customizable moving map functionality that was as much fun as the entertainment selection.

The entertainment system at my seat didn't work and when I alerted a flight attendant it was met with a shrug of the shoulders. HRB-PEK with old aircraft and tired crew.

Final leg of a code-share with Turkish Airlines originating in Denmark transferring in Istanbul transferring to Air China in Beijing and completing segment in Hong Kong. Flight was delayed in total 5 hours. Ground staff gave at least 3 separate explanations of the delay. Passengers gathered around the Gate Desk and demanded answers after waiting more than 2 hours. When the flight boarded passengers came with numerous bags giving no regard to any of the printed limits or specifications on size or weight of carry-on items. The food selection was of significantly low quality. The aircraft itself was dated and seats were below average in terms of comfort.

The other passengers decided they could move seats and sit wherever they pleased and the flight attendants did nothing I didn't sit in my pre-selected assigned seat in either direction.

Air China customer review,5,2012-11-09,The price difference between Singapore Airlines and Air China is not huge for SIN PEK. Check-in at Beijing was average. Did not receive clear direction to lounge. Hot food was finished by 830pm so had to go airport cafe for dinner. The male toilet smelled even though it looked clean. Had to take a bus to board the plane. No instruction as to which bus. Business class boarded after economy! Very long seat although the seat can be wider. Very comfortable lie flat bed as I slept 5 hours out of the 6 hour flight. The food was plentiful but not very good quality and drinks selection limited. The flight attendants were actually quite good and attentive but they lacked product knowledge as four staff unable to work out how to lift the TV screen and the economy passengers were let to rush into exit on disembarkation!

Air China customer review,1,2012-10-07,"Sydney to Munich (via Shanghai and Beijing). Our flight Sydney to Shanghai where we had a technical stop was fine. However our flight to Beijing was delayed for reportedly ‘weather reasons’ although when we arrived in Beijing with a delay of 4 hours there were no signs of any bad weather. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight to Europe. In the arrival hall all all service desk were closed and unstaffed despite around 40 people also missing their connecting flights with Air China. The flight attendants from our flight made the effort to call some service staff and left us. After 1 hour of waiting no one had turned up. We eventually made our way into the departure area (without having visas for China) where all Air China counters were also unstaffed. The one staff member we found was unable/unwilling to help us and advised us that Air China service desks would open at 6:30am (4 hours later). Rather than getting a hotel room meal vouchers assistance in booking to connecting flights and most importantly an apology as is standard service with every other airline we had no choice other than finding a bench in the departure hall and try to sleep there. There were families with babies/small children travelling with us and had to do the same. At 6:30am all stranded passengers queued for the service counter which also could not/refused to help us and referred us to the ticketing counter which would open an hour later. When it eventually opened the staff suggested booking us to the next flight to Munich which would depart 18 hours later. I said that was unacceptable and asked to be booked on a Lufthansa flight to Munich (4 hours later). Lufthansa and Air China are both in the Star Alliance and I assumed it was standard practice to use partner airlines to get passengers to their final destinations as quickly as possible in those circumstances. However she refused to book us on Lufthansa. I had to make the suggestion to fly via Dusseldorf (7hours later with Air China) which was reluctantly arranged. We then had to pick up our luggage and check it in again. This involved another 1.5 hours of waiting time with the result that after receiving dismissive and rude answers from baggage staff we were informed that both our bags had gone missing. We filled in the missing luggage report which took so long that it was too late to go to the hotel that Air China eventually offered (although fellow travellers reported that Air China expected random people to share rooms!). We arrived in Munich with a delay of over 17 hours. We have emailed Air China asking for feedback on the terrible experience we have made but after over one month we still have not received a response. Throughout our trip Air China staff were rude dismissive and at the first moment keen to say ""this isn't my responsibility"".",False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,1,,,False

Air China customer review,7,2012-09-25,For the price from Australia to Europe return Air China is excellent value. But traveling through Beijing and a sneaky hidden stop over in Shanghai to your destination puts a sour taste in the mouth. For a start even though you are transiting through China to you're destination you must clear customs in both Shanghai and Beijing this process is 10/10 in the stress factor especially if you are a first time traveler via these cities. As this was our first European holiday my wife and I found out the hard way that cheap airfares are cheap for a reason. As for Air China as a carrier I can not complain the service was good food typical for an aircraft seats average for comfort in economy class entertainment good.

Seats no worse than many other airlines in economy - maybe an inch more than some. Food quality ok. Wine only served at end of main meal! Staff fine. Loos ok. Entertainment a bit limited and one seat back terminal ropey and you need the double mono adapter. Flights all pretty much on time. Beijing transfer is a bit tricky first time - go to the ""transfer passenger"" queue on the far right of all other queues looks slow but works ok then down escalator and back through security.

Air China customer review,1,2012-09-09,Sydney via Shanghai/Beijing to London. Checked in at Sydney and told flight was delayed by 5 hours due to heavy rain in Beijing. At check in and subsequently on flight we were reassured that all information and assistance would be given at Beijing. We arrived just before 4am - there were no Air China Staff on duty and no directions as to where we should go eventually we found our way to the International Duty Manager's desk which did not open until 5.30am. Once Air China Staff arrived they initially refused to speak to us or offer any assistance. About six hours after arrival waiting going between desks collecting luggage we were given a box of food and a milk drink and checked in on a flight Frankfurt. The flights themselves were cheap adequate and clean Cabin Crew were polite but had difficulty communicating in English. I was disappointed with the poor service shown by Air China airport staff and their lack of honesty in communicating what was to be expected at Beijing especially in view that the situation in Beijing was beyond their control and would not have involved a loss of face despite their poor management and lack of skill in dealing with an adverse situation.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,2,,,False
Air China customer review,2,2012-09-09,HKG to Beijing connecting to London. Inbound flight delayed by 2.5 hours due to bad weather caused us to miss our connecting flight to London. On arrival in Beijing a Chinese man with a sign gave us a sticker and a friendly couple explained to us we were being put up in a hotel overnight because there were no connecting flights until the next day. We followed the sign man and queued for immigration after finally getting through sign man had vanished. A number of passengers were also left behind and approached the Air China information desk. After hearing our problem both employees went and did not return. A representative was sent to meet us and after waiting a couple of hours we were taken to our hotel. The hotel was pretty gross and breakfast inedible however it was provided at no extra cost. The next morning a bus was provided to take us to the airport. After queuing for almost 3 hours we were issued boarding passes. Onboard the plane staff unfriendly and unable to smile. The food was poor. Finally we arrived in London after travelling for 28 hours. Our flight back was a bit better as we were only delayed by 9 hours in Beijing!

Air China customer review,8,2012-09-09,HKG - PEK - JFK and back. Check-in at Hong Kong International Airport was great. Flight from Hong Kong left on time and was quite comfortable. Landing in Beijing was on time. The main concern that I had was the customs / metal detector line where you pass through to the International Departures area. It was apparent from my observations that Air China has sold a lot of International to International flights going through Beijing Airport to the point where China Customs has too many international transfer people to check which leads to a delay. I wouldn't fault China Customs as they had every one of the four international transfer desks open. After customs an even bigger delay occurred at the metal detector area for International transfers which only had one of the two counters open. Because of the aforementioned delays I made it to my JFK flight just as it began boarding. My wife who flew two weeks after I did missed her connection to JFK because Hong Kong was in the midst of a typhoon. It took Air China a while to process her for the next day's flight and put her in a hotel. When my wife arrived at the hotel she was surprised to be informed that Air China was going to put her in a room with a roommate and subsequently paid an extra USD$24 to get her own room. Flying back from JFK was pleasant and we arrived on time in Beijing. There is no plug-in point for a laptop or iPad so my battery died halfway through the flight. The aircraft does not have personal screens in the Economy Section. After spending the night at the hotel located in the Departures Area of Beijing National Airport we had another pleasant flight back to Hong Kong. Overall a good experience.

Air China customer review,7,2012-09-04,Business class London Gatwick to Beijing to Ulaanbaatar Mongolia. The new-ish business class lounge at Gatwick (North Terminal) is excellent for a short stay but perhaps not the best if you have a 3 or four hour lay-over. Aircraft was A330-200 seat 13L. Cabin was a little tired but was still in reasonable condition. The seat cushions were a little firm but the space and width were reasonable. I was worried that the full recline/flat bed was not actually going to be flat but it was and was very comfortable for a sleep. Supplied also with pyjamas and quilt for a snooze. Staff very attentive and there was no need to request drinks or top- ups as these were forthcoming throughout the flight. The Chinese meal was good but a little tasteless. A bit more variety and freshness may have improved it a bit. The AVOD completely froze for my seat and was never rectified throughout. However glancing at the programmes and films on offer I did not miss much as it was very dated. Punctuality excellent. Beijing T3 is not the easiest to change flights within and there is no channels for business class to speed up the process. As there were several flights arriving there was a very long queue of at least 200 waiting for the immigration check (although it was just a check to then be allowed in to the area for security - where there was another queue).

Both of the flights on the way to Singapore were delayed by about 3 hours. The economy food was very poor; the beer and wine undrinkable; and the service was minimalistic. The crew seemed to have a very low level of English. They only offered drinks other than water once during the five hour flight from Beijing to Singapore and even water was not offered enough.

Inflight entertainment was basic (small TV in each seat) consisting of 4/5 movies (2 Chinese + 2/3 English). Cabin crew was efficient but service was basic.

Air China customer review,5,2012-08-13,Very mediocre experience and an airline I'll be avoiding in the future. I was flying direct London to Beijing but the quality was worse than some domestic Chinese flights I've taken. I had to change seats a grand total of 4 times. Each time because my inflight entertainment system wasn't working and it wasn't until my fourth seat that the screen was working. During this time the stewards and stewardesses were co-operative in helping me find a seat but not kind or apologetic in any way. As for the food the quality of the Chinese meal was somewhat better than the Western meal but neither especially good. My main complaint about the Western meal was the lack of vegetables and meat. The service was perfunctory and the stewardesses stern and at times rude. I just think they have no concept of what customer service is. They warmed to me slightly as I speak Mandarin and was travelling by myself. All in all Air China will get you from A to B and the stewardesses will bring you your food and drinks but whether or not you have a relaxing enjoyable flight is another matter.

I flew Air France to Shanghai last year and actually Air China compared quite favourably - there wasn't the same degree of choice with the inflight entertainment but the food was just as good and seats were probably more comfortable. You aren't provided with a takeaway 'pack' of things on this flight but there is a pillow and blanket on your seat and there are headphones for entertainment. The toilets were fine (yes they did get a bit gross towards the end but that happens on an 11 hour flight) and the staff were accommodating. My veggie meal wasn't on their list on the first leg of the outward bound journey but when I showed them my confirmation email they found me one without any fuss. Service at the check-in desks was also perfectly fine. The long haul planes had a personal television and were pretty full.

Other announcements were made but they were so quiet that I could not hear what was said. After 1 hour the food came out while we were still waiting on the ground.

IFE is AVOD with a reasonable section. PEK-HKG operated by a wet-leased Air Macau A320 - no IFE same mechanical service and poor food options. Service on return leg was mediocre.

Movie screen a little hard to see for short people. In truth most travelers had tablets or laptops playing their own movies or TV shows. Not much variety in sound system entertainment but again most people were listening to their own MP3 players or iPods. Bathrooms neat and clean. Whole experience comparable to United return to Beijing several years ago.",False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,,True
Air China customer review,2,2012-07-04,ICN-PEK-HKG. Flight from Incheon to Beijing was decent but when we arrived in Beijing that's when things fell apart transferring to flight to Hong Kong. After going through immigration and security for the second time in Beijing with 15 minutes to spare until boarding - rushed to the gate to make it on time. Other passengers notify me that the flight has been cancelled due to high winds in Hong Kong. When I tried to speak to a staff member he really didn't speak much English so communication was very difficult. They herded all passengers out of the airport into buses and sent us to a hotel. Told that there isn't any flights to Hong Kong until the next morning but won't say exactly what time. Told if we want our own rooms we have to pay $150.00. A hotel staff member communicates to us that the bus will be leaving at 4am back to the airport. We get to the airport and finally we're told at the counter that there is a flight at 6.30am to Hong Kong. What should have been a 5 hr 40 mins travel time turned into a 13+ hour travel time with the airline hardly communicating what was going on.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,2,,,False
Air China customer review,2,2012-07-04,We flew economy from San Francisco to Beijing. The plane was full. The plane was very old proven by ashtrays throughout the plane. My seat was very uncomfortable with little leg room. The food was awful. I asked for pork and was told she was out of it after a different attendant took it just as I was about to be served. The chicken was tasteless. The only thing I had to eat was rice. The movie screen picture was horrible. The flight attendants hid behind curtains and only occasionally came out to hand out warm water. I flew on 4 flights within China and they all were just as bad.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,,False
Air China customer review,4,2012-06-17,Frankfurt to Taipei return. On the way to Taipei I missed the connection at Beijing because the flight was delayed by two hours. At Beijing airport my luggage was missing found it eventually but that took more than one hour. At the ticket counter I was lucky to find a seat on the next flight departing the next day. The company offered to cover my accommodation expenses for the night but that was a basic hotel room to share with two other passengers. I refused their offer which I found disgusting and insulting. On the way back to Frankfurt I had to change flight twice. At every time I had to pass the immigration check to collect my luggage and check in again. Luckily I had enough time to do that. Hongzouh to Beijing was canceled. The company announced the flight was canceled two hours before the departure. Until then the flight was scheduled as normal. The reason for canceling the flight was the disruption of the air signalling system caused by the launch of a space ship. The launch was scheduled to take place at 6.30 pm. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 8.00 pm. Eventually two other passengers and I managed to get the last three seats on to another flight to Beijing. The departure time of the latter was 7.00 pm but the flight was delayed by one hour. No problem from Beijing to Frankfurt. This was my first experience with Air China and will be the last one.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,2,,,False
Air China customer review,6,2012-06-17,Business/Economy class CDG-PEK-PVG-CDG. CDG-PEK on 777-300ER business class a prized flatbed which is great for a 10 hours flight. My welcome drink was snatched away before I could finish it. Food was plentiful but taste awful. IFE froze and was rebooted 3 times. Crew was robotic. PEK-PVG on A340 in economy. Uncomfortable seat no personal IFE. Crew good for economy class standard. They did 2 rounds of drinks and each PAX was given a tasteless muffin with a fried egg inside. PVG-CDG on 340 Business class old style business class seat and I found myself sliding down the seat the whole night. It was supposed to be angled flat but I would call it flat with bumps. The crew asked me if I would like a welcome drink and handed me a food and drink menu. I ordered red wine and was told that red wine bottle would be opened only after takeoff. Crew service was a little impersonal but did perform their work professionally. Ground service efficient - quick check-in meet and greetings hostess efficient to/from airport-hotel limousine transfers offered. If you find yourself flying Air China business make sure it is on their 777-300ER.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,,True
Air China customer review,3,2012-06-06,Frankfurt to Shanghai. Old A340 entertainment - 2 screens awful. Service personnel ok but I had the feeling they just wanted to get the flight over and done with sat at the back most of the time occasionally came through with some water. Luggage left in Frankfurt not prepared to put it on another Star Alliance flight - had to wait for same flight next day.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,,False
Air China customer review,4,2012-05-29,Paris to Beijing in business class on a 777-300 and return from Shanghai to Paris in business class on A340. Seating on the 777 is excellent with new seats large TV screens and a 2-2-2 configuration. On the A340 the configuration was the same but there were older seats smaller TV screens though I cannot complain about seating. On both legs staff were friendly and attentive. What is disappointing was the quality of the meals. I have seldom tasted such bland food and the presentation was horrible. Before take-off only orange juice and water were served. Wines (good selection of French wines) were excellent but must have been very expensive because there was no second serving nor were liquors offered at the end of the meal. Another drawback was the total absence of reading materials in English or in French except a few China Daily newspapers. A large proportion of the offered movies were oldies. If you are not interested in food if you bring your own reading materials Air China is a good option as it is cheap and not too many people fly it so you have plenty of space.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,,True
Air China customer review,6,2012-05-27,LHR-PEK return in economy. Did the same journey last year this time it was slightly less enjoyable due to the seats I was in on the A330. On both legs 46J and 46L had a dodgy IFE whereas it appeared the rest of the plane was having no problems. Both legs had old interior/IFE seat material was uncomfortable legroom was ok for a small person like myself taller people may have problems. Food wasn't top notch but they still give you 2 full meals. Flight attendants do plenty of drink runs and were friendly. Outbound flight landed 30 mins early inbound landed on time. Will probably fly again as prices and schedules suit me.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,,True
Air China customer review,2,2012-05-16,London-Beijing overnight return Shanghai-Beijing-London. Outward on a brand new A330 with individual screens and entertainment systems. Food not good and ran out of beer 2 hours into flight. All staff very surly and just sat at the back - no water/drink offers apart from 2 meal times. Shanghai-Beijing on old 747 - again surly staff with no smiles. Beijing-London on old A330 with very poor entertainment system - only 2 films both in Chinese! Food appalling ran out of 2nd choice within a few rows of service starting. Again all staff unfriendly.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,,False
Air China customer review,5,2012-05-08,SYD-PEK. The seats entertainment and service were all very average. The food was edible but not enjoyable.

Air China customer review,3,2012-05-01,PEK-FRA on 777 economy. Seats were fine and the inflight entertainment system was nice although most of the entertainment was Asian. Staff were unfriendly and uncommunicative. Toilets were not cleaned during the flight and they were very dirty towards the end. No alcohol served after the main meal. The food was also quite sad.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,3,,,False
Air China customer review,1,2012-04-30,Flew Beijing direct to JFK. A 13.5 hour flight with 2 terrible meals no personal television screens and just a few screens dotted around. Unfortunately Air China use videotapes to show films and so the picture was crackly. Very little room and a most uncomfortable experience. Additionally flight attendants spend most of the flight behind a curtain trying to get some sleep. On the return flight there was a 4 hour delay. No apology or explanation. On our arrival in Beijing we were kept waiting for 1.5 hours for our baggage while employees were standing around laughing and joking amongst themselves.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,,False
Air China customer review,8,2012-04-25,Melbourne to Shanghai then onto London return. Booked Air China due to them being $1500 less than any other flights to the UK. The food entertainment and service weren't top class but for the price they were good. We had to transfer between flights at Shanghai but staff helped us with every aspect. Due to reading the comments on here we were prepared with our own snacks and some entertainment which I would advise. Would definitely fly them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,,True
Air China customer review,8,2012-04-16,Hong Kong-Paris via Beijing. Price of this trip was excellent. The first 3 flights were on comfortable planes while the final leg from Beijing to HKG was on an old leased Air Macau plane which was rather cramped. Food isn't great but flights were on time and the air hostesses excellent. Movie selection is spartan but I took an ipod so didn't mind. The one curious policy is that Air China keep the fasten seat belt signs on throughout the flights. Would certainly fly again if price remains at least $HK 1500 lower than its competitors.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,,True
Air China customer review,5,2012-04-10,SFO-PEK in economy. Rebooked on CA after UA delay. In terms of seating not enough legroom but was made better because flight was relatively empty and my wife and I had an extra seat between us. Food was low average about the same standards as UA economy transpacific flights. Their wine selection was small and there were no spirits offered. Soft drink selection very minimal as well. Plane was uncomfortably warm but FAs did turn down the temperature after I requested. Entertainment was on the big screen and mostly Chinese programming. Their domestic flights w/in china are very comfortable with excellent service but their international flights are very bare-boned.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,,False
Air China customer review,8,2012-03-28,ATH-MUC-PEK-MUC-ATH on time A332. The older a/c had bad IFE with only 6 movies and no feet support.

Air China customer review,2,2012-03-26,DUS-PEK-MNL return. 2.5 hours delay to PEK in DUS. Unfriendly flight attendants food acceptable. On the return PEK to DUS no beer or red wine left after 30 min. However red wine served again with the second meal. I tried to complain but flight attendants just laughed and try to make a joke of it. Would not recommend.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,2,,,False

Air China customer review,7,2012-03-21,Vancouver to Beijing return in economy. My vegetarian meal was quite good and the service good. Pillows and blankets provided as were earphones. The downside being the movies were not on demand and as such I did not watch them. Both flights on time. My only complaint would be the lack of on demand video and I would suggest the bathroom floors be mopped (this seems to be an issue on all long haul flights I have been on).,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,,True
Air China customer review,7,2012-03-19,Vancouver to Hong Kong Via Beijing. Seating was comfortable food good and the stewardess polite. Our flight leaving Vancouver was delayed 3 hours so could not make our connecting flight to HKG. Arrangements made for free accommodation in Beijing. When we got to Beijing the transfer station misdirected us. Afterwards I found out there was an Air China official looking after other passengers who were also delayed. We had to wait another 2-3 hours for other delayed passengers to pick up their luggage. It seems that Air China need to improve procedures to deal with delayed passengers in Beijing.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,,True
Air China customer review,2,2012-03-13,Stockholm-Bangkok via Beijing. Return flight Bangkok-Frankfurt via Beijing. Seat was awful headphone socket didn't work. Food was poor and service was slow I managed to get 3 beers in 6 hours after that they were out of beer and wine. Business class Beijing-Bangkok. Only good thing was the seat - fairly comfortable though no electric socket for laptop. Service not up to much. Very poor English from staff. Toilets smelt really bad and were dirty.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,,False
Air China customer review,8,2012-02-28,Beijing to Shanghai. Only one check-in desk for standby passengers. Flight time was 2 hours. Hot meals served and no options.

Air China customer review,5,2012-02-22,"London to Sydney return via Beijing. A cheap flight and lived up to cheap expectations. Very friendly check-in at Heathrow and Sydney. Chinese staff do not speak much English. Meal selection was ""Chinese"" or ""Western"" with menus offered on only Heathrow-Beijing and Beijing-London sections. No snacks in between meals and no amenity bag. Drinks were revolting - no ice and tea is warm and stewed black tea. Coffee has milk powder to add. Announcements in English impossible to understand Captains' English was good on all flights. Overall it lived up to expectations with good entertainment and the food was okay. Due to poor English and lack of assistance from staff I would not recommend or fly again with this airline.",False,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,,False
Air China customer review,3,2012-02-03,Sydney-Beijing-Paris then Rome-Beijing to Sydney for a family holiday. That's four 12hr flights. As others have said price is the only advantage of this airline ($1500 AUD return to Europe from Australia during new year). The plane's facilities were poorly maintained (seat cushions slip at awkward angles TV screen falling apart or not working poor selection of entertainment toilets unkempt and food that was difficult to stomach). However it was mainly the other passengers that made it worse - yelling clearing their throats loudly rude to staff jamming their seats up and down violently and worst of all leaving the toilets a mess. Perhaps a single 12hr flight would have been tolerable but 2 of them in a row was insufferable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,,False
Air China customer review,3,2012-01-31,Round-trip from Hong Kong to Munich. The main reason for flying Air China was no surprises the price and that was also the best and only good thing about the flight. The food was atrocious the plane worn out and the so-called entertainment system awful. The bathrooms were bad. Conclusion: everyone has their own priorities but next time I'll pay extra to fly another airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,,False
Air China customer review,4,2012-01-30,LAX-PEK return. Food low quality staff appeared when time for mandatory service large screen viewing on main bulkhead without sound on both trips. They were older 747s. It seems staff had something to say at irregular intervals making it hard to try and sleep but they were very good at making business transactions ignoring everyone so they could count money and look at receipts.
