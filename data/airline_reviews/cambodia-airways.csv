"""definitely use the airline again""",7,2022-08-27,"Not that much leg room. If you are over 180cm tall, you will be bashing your kneecaps, but otherwise, the seat is pretty comfortable. The services from the cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Due to Covid restrictions, no snack was served on this flight. There is no screen in the seats, so you must supply your own inflight entertainment. Would definitely use the airline again, as their routes are handy and they were punctual.",True,A319,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phnom Penh to Koh Samui,July 2022,3,4,,4,4,,True
"""please do not book with them!""",1,2019-12-17,Siem Reap to Sihanoukville. They cancelled our flights due to “commercial” reasons and then when they offered to refund us money we never received it. Been 2 weeks and I have emailed them when the money will be back in my account. We feel so scammed and upset please please do not book with them!,True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Siem Reap to Sihanoukville,December 2019,,,,,1,,False
