Then I read their policy over and over and again it said no cancellation fees. I called back and spoke to someone and said this is not acceptable your policy clearly states no cancellation fees. I had to fight with this person and I told them I will see them in court and call news crews. They finally gave me back my 200.00 dollars. I still have the policy and no fees incurred on my phone.

It seems completely irresponsible to me that an airline would not keep track of pilot hours flown in order to avoid putting their customer through the situation we experienced. Before we boarded we were informed that our flight would not be non-stop, which is what we paid for. The reason given was that be the time we reached Baltimore the customs agents would have quit work for the day. We were rerouted through Houston, which added another two hours to our total flying time. When we arrived in Houston we had to drag our carry-ons out of the plane at 11:00 p.m. to have them clear customs--over three hours after we were to have landed in Baltimore--then lug them back onto the plane. Our flight finally touched down in Baltimore around 4:00 a.m., over eight hours later than the scheduled 7:45 p.m. arrival of the previous day. At least my grandson and I could go home. Many travelers were transferring in Baltimore to other destinations. For them, the agony of the day only continued. I will add that our check-in to go to Costa Rica on Saturday, August 6 did not go well either. The line at the international check-in was over one-eighth of a mile long! I have photos to prove it. Southwest did not have sufficient agents to accommodate the customers on the international flights they had booked. They were grossly understaffed.

Southwest offered the passengers on our returning flight a $200 coupon good for another Southwest flight within the next year. Big deal! We paid $1,000 round trip, $500 each way.

When Southwest arrived on the national scene years ago as a regional airline which was expanding I was very impressed. They can blame their current problems encountered by me, my grandson, and all the other customers on COVID, not enough employees, supply-chain issues, or whatever other excuses are in vogue these days. It is clear to me that this company has devolved to a significant degree. They have lost the customer-orientation they once had. Not being able to add the hours a pilot flies, and not being able to compute how many check-in people are needed for the departing flights are issues of poor management. Very poor!

On Monday, July 25th, 2022, my daughter and I were returning home from Atlanta to NYC (LaGuardia) via Southwest Airlines. First time ever using them. We arrive at the airport at 4AM for a 6:10AM flight. After going through TSA and sitting at the gate for a while, our flight was cancelled with no announcement or warning. My daughter happened to look up and see on the gate TV screen the words “CANCELLED”. The gate personnel were gone and I was left to 1) calm my daughter’s nerves because she has never experienced this before 2) calm my own nerves as I suffered from severe anxiety and my meds were in my checked bag and 3) try to figure out what to do next. Keep in mind, I booked the early morning flight because I had to be home by 9:30am to take over the babysitting duties of my two other children so that my wife could go to work. So that was my first thing to address, finding last minute child care. I then get an email confirming that my flight was indeed cancelled (no explanation as to why) and I was put on the 8:25 PM plane to LGA later that night. So now the next steps were to find out what happened to our checked bags and what to do for 14 hours till my flight with pretty much no money left for my daughter and I to find a hotel (I mean we’re taking a low budget airline. I’m a stay-at-home dad living on my wife’s income. Go figure). 14 hours later with our bags in NY before we are even on a plane, we get to the departing gate for our rescheduled 8:25pm flight and of course it’s DELAYED. 9:10pm is the new departure time. Then it’s pushed back to 10PM!!! Once on the plane, only water and a snack was offered to us (soda, coffee and alcohol were no longer an option). Once at LaGuardia, we then had to find our checked bags. My pre-arranged airport pick-up, no longer available. The line for a taxi, extremely long. My daughter and I jumped on a city bus to take us to Manhattan so that we could take a taxi to the Bronx. $30 dollars I couldn’t afford to spend charged to my credit card.

The agent informed me that the first flight was canceled due to weather and that the rescheduled flight was delayed due to air traffic control issues, so we were not entitled to compensation. 1) I never once said on the call I wanted to be compensated so that was quite an assumption and 2) was then told after reiterating everything I went through “would you have preferred that we put you on an unsafe flight?” I mean WOW!!!!!

Last fall he received a promotion from Southwest that if he traveled one round trip flight anywhere, he could retain his A-List status. Unfortunately, he had been diagnosed with cancer back in the spring of 2021 and began undergoing cyberknife treatments in September 2021. His doctors specifically told him he should not travel through the remainder of the year as he was immunocompromised. We contacted Southwest and let them know the situation. The agent with whom I spoke advised that if we could provide a certification from his oncologist, they would consider our request to extend his status despite the fact he was unable to travel even the bare minimum in 2021. Yesterday, after going through a second appeal process following an initial denial of our request from Southwest, we were told they would not be able to honor our request. I am absolutely appalled that this airline, which our entire family has supported religiously for the past 20 years (in addition to all of my husband's business travel), would not consider these extenuating circumstances and grant him an exception.

Our first flight we were going to NM from Maine, and, due to a technical error, my name was misspelled and it took staff a very long time both times to fix the name on the boarding pass (but I don’t blame the staff, I blame the system that Southwest uses). We were already there two hours early so we had time to do the things we needed to do before boarding, but Southwest Airlines will be giving you so much time that you won’t know what to do with yourself. We were told that the very first delay was due to the plane being “too heavy” because of passengers, baggage, and fuel. After they sorted that out, we were finally on our way. After we landed for our connecting flight in Baltimore, we waited an hour on the pavement to get to a terminal because all of them were full.

"""not be flying Southwest again""",1,2021-08-07,"Over the past year and half, my husband and I have flown many times on Southwest, and prior to the Covid pandemic, Southwest was always our airline of choice for domestic flights. The pandemic changed things, quite understandably, and we have had patience in what we know has been a difficult situation. However, the past several flights we have completed with Southwest have definitely taken turns for the worst in terms of customer service, with flights being rescheduled without notification to us, re-routing us to flights that are not non-stop (when our originally booked flights were nonstop), returning us to our home town in the middle of the night (when our originally-purchased itinerary arrived late afternoon), losing our luggage, etc. But this is finally the last straw. We will not be flying Southwest again. In June, my mother passed away. The memorial service is scheduled to take place on August 8th. In July, as soon as the memorial service dates were confirmed, we booked our flights back to Portland from Colorado for the memorial service. Twenty-four hours before our flight time, we checked in, as is the usual routine with Southwest. We were assigned seats. Some hours later, we received the usual emails with reminders for timeliness of arrival to the airport for our flight, mask requirements, etc. Now, less than 8 hours prior to our flight departure time, we checked our flight status to give my family final updates for our arrival time only to find that Southwest has canceled our flight. All other flights from Denver to Portland within the next 24 hours are listed by Southwest as ""Unavailable."" We called the ""Contact Us"" number for Southwest Airlines to try to figure out what we could do to rectify the situation. After sitting on hold for literally 2 hours (with what became an increasingly annoying message about how sorry Southwest was for the delay and that they would be ""right with us, as soon as possible""), we finally gave up and hung up. While sitting on hold, we found and booked a flight on a different airline, at last minute prices with luggage fees, etc. This behavior by Southwest Airlines is profoundly unprofessional and completely unacceptable. It breaches the contract Southwest Airlines entered into with us, as its passengers, of a service they were to provide (transportation from Colorado to Oregon), paid for in advance, with the express understanding that the service would, in fact, be provided. At the very least, timely notice of the inability to provide the service should have been provided, along with an explanation as to why the service was canceled at the last minute with literally no notice to us of the cancellation. No offer of restitution or alternative transportation has been made, and Southwest has refused to provide any sort of customer service (although I'm sure that no one could be paid enough to have to deal with customers treated in such a fashion by their employer). After going on line and reading recent Washington Post (among others) articles, we now see that Southwest has been doing this to its customers for the past several months. They certainly won't be doing it for very much longer, because they will be out of business soon. You cannot treat your customers like this and expect to continue to have any.

I used to recommend Southwest to everyone. Well let me tell you, no more! Their service, quality, and customer care has gone down the drain! I finally got to visit my family this summer after a year and a half of not seeing most of them due to the pandemic. Myself and my three boys traveled to our destination via American Airlines. Had no issues there - great service and a nice plane! On the way back, however, I traveled via Southwest. Unbeknownst to me they had changed my nonstop flight to a flight with one stop in Orlando. I found this out when checking on my flight a few days before. Now in their defense, I searched my email and they had notified me of this change back in the beginning of May via an email that I am fairly certain ended up in my promotions folder instead of my inbox or else I would have seen it. The thing that urked me is that they made this change the day after I bought my 3 nonstop tickets. The day after their sale ended, they decided to get rid of a bunch of nonstop flights. How convenient for them... Not so much all of us who booked with them because we wanted a nonstop flight. I was hoping they had one this week that I could change it to, but nope. Checked their website - none. Now mind you, I was traveling alone with three boys. My oldest is 6 and the other two are both under the age of 2 (a 21 month old and a 6 month old). If you are a parent, you understand how difficult this could be. I waited on hold for almost 2 hours just for them to tell me they could refund my tickets, but if I used flight credit it would stay as flight credit (not helpful as they have no nonstop flights on this route anymore). They said they ""temporarily"" got rid of nonstop flights from their schedule. I looked at my options for the week and either the layovers were way too short to make it to the other plane for us or they were long and required even more flight time. Needless to say, I had to keep my flight. By then other airlines were too expensive and Southwest said they could not book us on another airline. I was told this before I even asked so you know a bunch of people must have asked this. I haven't gotten to the worst part yet.. We had a fine first flight to Orlando. A little over two hours. They kept changing the time but ended up boarding on time after all. We made it to Orlando and our stroller was already waiting for us when we got off the plane. Kudos to Orlando people. Flying to Dallas was a different story. We were sitting in the plane an hour before we took off. This was due to the weather, so that, I understand. This was another 2 and a half hour flight as well. My poor kids were doing fairly well despite traveling all day. (Remember, two of them are a young toddler and a baby.) Near the end of the flight while we had been traveling for over 11 hours already one of the flight attendants remarks about the mess we had made (my toddler spilled some chip crumbs on the floor) and said that we would have to clean it up, but she said it in a passive aggressive way and asked if we needed.",True,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Philadelphia to Dallas via Orlando,August 2021,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",3,3,,False,3

"""how far this flight company has fallen""",1,2021-07-27,"Back in the day, Southwest was the best airline to fly domestically in the states. I do not know what happened. This last trip has been the worst flight experience I have ever encountered. To start my trip, I booked my flights with a longer, 2 hour layover to ensure a slight delay would not hinder my travel. This still was not the case. Southwest changed the gate and plane in Norfolk, resulting in a delay. Next, we boarded and waited for over an hour to just get gas in the plane. Meanwhile, planes scheduled after mine were boarding and taking off, in the original gate my flight was supposed to be. Almost 2 hours later, we took off. I knew I was cutting my layover short at that point, but we were scheduled to arrive with just enough time to spare. I sprinted to my gate, to see my next flight's plane sitting there. The ramp to get on was still connected to the airplane, but no one was there to check me in. I frantically looked around for someone to help me, but no one was in the area. I had to watch my plane leave without me. I then got a text stating they had rescheduled me to the next day in the evening. I went and talked to a Southwest representative, who helped change my flight to earlier in the day, but would not offer any other flights to the surrounding airports in LA for the evening. I requested they compensate and put me in a hotel, as I now had to stay overnight. I was informed that they would not put me in a hotel because they were not responsible for me missing my flight. They blamed the flight control in Norfolk, instead of taking responsibility for being very unorganized, resulting in 9 people missing their flight (to Ontario; there were many more traveling to other places). I talked to another representative to see if I could get a better boarding position, as I had the boarding position B1 prior to them sending my plane off. They had given me C13, which is considerably worse. They would still not compensate me at all. I have been unable to talk to a customer service representative, but if this is how Southwest treats their customers now, I will not be back. I did my research during the extra time I had of sitting in the airport overnight, and apparently Southwest has the highest delayed flights percentage. Two years ago, this was unheard of.

So, while I'm panicking because I needed to be in Long Island by Friday, not Saturday, I decided I was going to just show up and play dumb! So, I did!

She was sent home under hospice care with as little as a week to live. I was determined to see her. We landed in Sacramento which showed a 4 hour layover. I didn't want to delay and needed to get to Salem. I checked Alaska and they had a flight that would arrive 2 hours earlier. I booked the flight and flew Portland. After arriving in Portland drove to Salem to see my Mother. That afternoon I received an email from Southwest informing me that the rest of my itinerary had been canceled and all payments forfeited. I called and the support person said because I didn't cancel the flight, and didn't inform them, that my return trip was canceled and money forfeited. I guess I forgot to read the fine print. Because of this policy, even though I felt it more important to get to my Mother's side, I now didn't have a return flight. I used to fly Southwest.

I still had a small travel voucher that I didn't want to go to waste, so I decided to use it. My experience was average, I suppose. While I've also written generally glowing reviews about SLC airport, the SWA check-in staff at SWA were blasé. Not rude, not mean, but also not remotely interested-acting or helpful. Just robotic. I even get more helpful service on United (relatively speaking, and that says something). Same for the SWA gate staff. As for flight staff, the flight attendants were a mix of very cheery and upbeat (almost scarily so), or yeah, blasé and even kind of bossy to and barking orders at passengers. Not very helpful. At least the FA I had to interact with for the most part was the cheery and upbeat one. Once at Houston Hobby, it took almost 30 minutes to retrieve checked baggage from the carousel, while this may be more of a Hobby airport personnel problem, this is a problem that Southwest needs to address with airport management, as the airport is an airline hub. On the bright side, the plane was almost spanking new and very clean. The snack and Coke served were delicious. The plane was only about half occupied, though I don't know whether that has to do with bookings and demand, or with the fact that we're still in a pandemic. Social distancing was possible and enforced, as a result. Overall summary: at least this flight experience on SWA was average rather than hostile, so I guess that's an improvement for this airline.

First of all many of the passengers were not wearing their masks as required in the waiting area before boarding the flight. Some of the same passengers, at least 23 by my count, boarded the plane without their masks covering their mouths and noses. They walked in this manner by the Southwest flight attendants and were not stopped or directed to comply with the rules. A lady and an Asian man seated themselves in seats 4b and 4c. They began taking about liberty and their freedoms and would not wear their masks. Seats 4d, 4e and 4f. had passengers that would not wear their masks properly and they began discussing liberty and freedom loudly. The spoke to a passenger nearby that indicated they should comply with the rules since we have a global pandemic. Those passengers commented that their is no pandemic and the new media has promoted a hoax. All of the sickness is a hoax including the media, the drug companies and the liberal media. It is difficult for a crew to control morons. The crew did have several opportunities to not allow these individuals on the plane to begin with. If they will not comply in the boarding area then they must not be allowed to board. Other passengers and I purchased our tickets to fly based upon the contract and trust that Southwest would not allow passengers on the plane if they would not comply. For the first 30 minutes the Captain and the First Officer did not turn on condition air to save Southwest money. Once security removed the lady that was ranting, denigrating the flight attendants and other passengers, the Captain and First Officer did get the air conditioning going. The flight remained at gate C27 for another hour as the crew sorted the mess. Several passengers never wore their masks properly. I do not want to get COVID and you do not either. Southwest executives must believe times are normal and have forgotten the raging pandemic. The boarding process jammed people next to each other in the name of loading quickly.

If you can charter a plane or have your own plane these issues will not affect you. Commoners like me will drive of find another way to get safely to any destination I must go to for work. Otherwise I am following the Governor's orders and minimizing any travel and recommend that to everyone. There is no reason not to wear a mask. I tried Southwest and you failed me.

I love flying Southwest, the employees are fun and accommodating, but this year which has been a tough year for the whole world and to top it off as an active military family we were recently put on orders to move out of state, making this year even more emotional and scary having to travel. Well while flying out of Ontario CA. On 11/28/2020 my husband, son and I were waiting to board and as usual Southwest has always treated military greatly so we wait for A listers and group A to board, usually small children and active duty is called next to board but we understand that doesn’t happen every time everywhere, well my husband approached the operations employee and kindly in a soft low tone asked do you allow military to board early here? Well a simple sorry sir no would of sufficed, but he just gave the most annoyed attitude tone and said “No we don’t, and you can go read online if you want” he didn’t even allow my husband to finish his sentence and he was extremely rude. Wait! You think that’s all oh no, we waited for our group and number to walk up and he looked at my husband and said “wait let me check that it really is your turn”, he didn’t want to let us on the plane until he made sure he verified all three of our tickets as if we were too incompetent to read the big letter and number on the boarding pass. I could feel and sense his anger and annoyed mood towards us with just his stare. I’m not one to give reviews much but this really bothered my heart and mind. A smile and a positive attitude can make a huge difference in a person but not bigger than a negative attitude and a frown. Flight 1258 out of Ontario, I will forever remember your rudeness and lack of care toward the military member “my husband” that has volunteered to serve so that your family doesn’t have to be drafted, so that all that freedom you have is possible and so that your personal family can feel safe.

I politely tried to tell the woman that I had a bag with food for the flight and a fleece jacket in it. Didn't matter. I was accused of having a fanny pack when I was wearing a waist belt in lieu of carrying a purse. I had a mini backpack with chargers that per Southwest, are not supposed to be checked in baggage and a small suitcase. I was not given an opportunity to combine anything. I do not consider a waist belt, which I was wearing and is similar to a money belt or passport belt, to be a carry on item. It takes up no more space on my body than a belt on my pants. I never remove the waist belt and it does not impede sitting in a single seat or fastening my seatbelt. I do not consider food that I was going to eat in flight, especially as I was taking an antibiotic at that time for a GI condition, to be a carry on item. There were many, many other passengers who were carrying food on the plane in addition to other carry on items. I have never heard of a coat/jacket being considered as a carry on item. When I left Phoenix it was almost 90 degrees. When I arrived in Detroit 4 hours later, the temperature was about 45. To say a jacket/coat was necessary is an understatement. The gate agent was incredibly and unnecessarily rude. I was embarrassed unnecessarily in front of other passengers waiting to board. I have GI issues and cannot eat anything that might have been served in flight. Taking my own food on a 4 hour flight did not seem unreasonable. The mini backpack I had is about the size of an ordinary shoe box. Had I been given the chance, I would have combined items (except the waist belt) but I was denied that opportunity. I submitted a complaint to Southwest post-flight and received an email that in essence, blamed me for having so many carry on items, quoted a number of Southwest policies on baggage as if I do not know how to read and more importantly, failed to provide what I consider to be a sincere apology or any language about the gate agent receiving any kind of coaching, reprimand or training to correct her inappropriate behavior.

I guess that was a funny joke for the employees to yell on the loud speaker that owner of a crown royal bag needed to come to the service desk. After realizing my bag was not coming I was directed to a room in the back where I inquired about the location of the bag. The airport staff then said oh you’re the owner of the Crown Royal bag and began to giggle. They informed that my bag fell and was ran over and some of my stuff have been destroyed with not even the smallest hint of remorse. My bag was literally destroyed to the point all the clothes and shoes In it were ripped to shreds / destroyed. When I became angry the south west employee asked me “what are you so mad about it’s not like we are not going to cut you a check”. I explained to the worker that I am in a city I have never been to with absolutely nothing to wear and all my belongings destroyed. The employee began to tell me how southwest is a million dollar company & they have no problem cutting a check as if this was suppose to make me feel better. The employee then told me it happens all the time due to southwest handling so much luggage on a daily basis and they just cut a check. The employees asked me to go through my bag and damages and asked me to price the cost of each item. The south west employee sat on the computer googled my items one by one while making comments like “ woah you really paid $200 for that ?” and arguing with me over the amount I paid for each item saying things like “ well they have it for cheaper at this store”. The worker also went as far to turn to his employee and say “ I don’t even argue with these people” After the employee calculated what he felt I deserved for my belongings he wrote a check for $620 and told me I should just go to the mall & buy new items. The employee told me I can go to chase bank and cash the check the same day which was a lie. I went to chase bank and they told me they could not cash check because southwest had to verify it and no one answered the phone. I was not able to cash check until I returned home from my vacation.

In order for you and your family members to sit together, you have to purchase the early bird check-in which assures you a place in line within the first 60 people. This does not work if your flight is delayed coming in and your connecting flight already boards everyone even the people who didn't pay for the early bird check-in. So you get screwed and lose your place in line which you paid for. So when they boarded us onto flight #1296 and we tell the flight attendant that we paid for the early bird check-in. The flight attendant says well we waited 20 minutes for your flight to get in. How is that the passenger's fault that the flight go in late? So they tell us to sit in the only available seats which are center seats not even in the same row. Also to make matters worse the seats are sandwiched in between 2 larger than normal-sized people. So I had to squeeze between 2 large people and my husband got to sit next to a 350lbs man who was partially in his seat so much so that he had to lay his tray table down to lean on it for the entire flight.

"""ridiculous customer service""",2,2019-07-19,"Absolutely ridiculous customer service. Don’t fly Southwest Airlines. Remember, you get what you pay for. If there are any issues that would require customer service assistance from this airline your done for. The nightmare initially begun on the 17th of July when I was scheduled to depart from St. Louis to arrive in Norfolk, VA. Arrive at the Southwest ticketing counter to learn my flight had been cancelled due to weather. Once I learned this, I asked the ticketing agent isn’t it protocol for someone to call, text, or email me the customer, to make them aware of the flight changes. The reply I got was priceless. Basically, my question was ignored. So, now the ticketing agent begins to look in order to rebook my flight. Now, they book me a flight for the very next morning. However, this time I will have to fly from St Louis to Cleveland, OH, then to Chicago, Illinois and then onto a Norfolk. Of course, I accept the reservation thinking all has been resolved and there would be no more issues. So approximately hours later I arrive back in St. Louis airport. I board the first flight from St. Louis thinking I’m finally on my way to my destination and I would be good to go. The plane lands arriving in Cleveland with the pilot coming on the speaker stating, “there’s a weather delay and no one can get in or out of Chicago”!  After sitting in Cleveland for almost four hours until finally being cleared for take off to continue the journey now to Chicago and then Norfolk. Finally, land in Chicago approximately three hours after my Southwest connection flight had already departed for Norfolk. I immediately go to Southwest customer service counter to explain what I just went through. First, I’m told all remaining flights are booked going to Norfolk. I’m also told that they can fly me to Baltimore, Maryland the next day, which would be the third day! And I’m also told when I get to Baltimore I would have to be on standby in order to try to get a flight to Norfolk. Now, my frustration is beginning to show. I ask if I would be provided a hotel here in Chicago and I was told no. So, I get no hotel, no later flight, and absolutely nothing at all in order to make up for this inconvenience. Not even a bag of peanuts or even a drink. I always knew this was a suspect airline. However, take it from me. Save your money and go United or Delta. If you don’t and something happens. In my case weather!!! Then, your just throwing your money away. I understand weather is not the airlines fault. However, it’s how the customer service takes care of their customers during that inconvenience is what is being measured. I’m a customer who definitely learns from their mistakes.

"""This is 100% unacceptable""",1,2019-06-29,"Not Verified |  I regretfully feel obligated to report my experience this previous weekend 6/22 regarding Southwest Airlines and their Southwest Vacations. I have been a loyal supporter of Southwest for over 15 years, and have had nothing but superior customer service and great experiences until this unfortunate event. I went to Southwest as I always do and decided to use their Southwest Vacations options since I was staying at a hotel this trip. Everything was fine, or so I thought, untill 6/22 my scheduled departure date. I go online to check in to my flight only to find out that my flight has been cancelled without notification to me. Surprised I call Southwest and try to understand what has happened. After about 2 hours on hold I was told that my flight was cancelled due to weather and that I had unknowingly booked through a 3rd party and not Southwest themselves, despite using the Southwest official website to book. After a 20 minute conversation I was forced to leave the following day as there were no flights remaining that day (unless I could get to the gate within 10 minutes), causing me to miss previously scheduled and paid for events that could not be made up or refunded. I then call the hotel and try to cancel my room since I will not be staying there and they said that since I booked though Southwest Vacations, they had to cancel the room and refund me. Did not seem like an issue. Fast forward to today, 6/27. I finally am back and get to speak with customer relations from Southwest. Thinking that this should not be much of an issue as they had miscommunication on their end, they could refund me for the nights stay that I would miss as they called and cancelled the night with the hotel, and would be able to compensate me in some manor for the error of not contacting me to allow me to get on a different flight earlier that day that had availability, and some possible compensation for the events that were missed. During the conversation with the agent for Southwest, she specifically said that ""They would take responibility"" for the error as Southwest Vacations is subcontracted though a 3rd party administrator. Even though it bears the offical Southwest logo, is accessed though their Official website, they contract out that to another party, but she still stated ""they would (were taking) take responsibility"" I think, great we can get this taken care of, to only have Southwest offer me a $50 voucher. $50 to cover 3 missed events, a premium room on Saturday night in Las Vegas, and a lost day of my vacation. This is 100% unacceptable as they themselves took responsibility for the error and still refused to at the very least refund me the money for the hotel room that was never used and some gesture for the error. I can not believe that Southwest who allows their logo and namesake to be used to mislead loyal customers into using something that they promote on their website, but then do not stand behind even though it holds their name is despicable. I felt disrespected as a loyal customer to be offered $50 for what was a loss of 20 times that amount.

This is our first time flying Southwest since August of 2018 and to fully explain my frustration with their customer service I’ll have to start with the story of them cancelling both of our flights and leaving us with no other option than for us to pay 1.2k each for tickets back home in order to catch our out of country flight the next day. We are both wedding photographers and were leaving New Orleans to head to Baltimore for a wedding. The morning of our flight, about two hours prior, we received a notification from Southwest Airlines that our flight was cancelled. They provided us with alternative flight options, which we selected and then put us on standby (without communicating this with us). Fast forward, after a 10+ hour travel day we made it to Baltimore a little after midnight. Keep in mind the direct flight is normally 2.5 hours.  The morning of our returning flight from Baltimore to New Orleans we received yet another cancellation notification. However, this time the link to their flight change wasn’t working, no flights were available to select and the help call line to book another flight had a wait time of 2-3 hours. And so I waited, because we didn’t really have any other option. And each time they picked up the call they disconnected us, leaving us with literally zero alternative flight options or any way to get in touch with Southwest Airlines. This charade continued on until 4pm in the afternoon, no contact from southwest, no alternative flights, they straight up cancelled our flights and gave us nothing in return. Because we were leaving the country the next day we had no other choice than to pay 1.2k for a ticket out of Baltimore. Southwest Airlines finally got in touch with us a few days later, not acknowledging any lack in their system, pretending as though the day of our cancelled departure never happened. They offered us a $75 voucher for our trouble. What. A. Joke. Now a year later in hopes that southwest has their stuff together, we’ve boarded our plane from New Orleans only for them to tell us an engine failed to stay on. They asked us to switch planes, no biggie. This stuff happens. Two hours later and we’re finally boarding the next plane. We miss our connecting flight in San Diego due to their delay and end up waiting another two hours for our next flight. They call us to the front desk to adjust our tickets (A group, what’s up - yes, we were quick, we were prepared!) and they had us boarding at the back of the plane. I kid you not. They not only delayed us by 4+ hours but they didn’t even have the courtesy of taking care of us by allowing us to board in our original position, or even during pre-boarding. Come on southwest, we were loyal before you repeatedly screwed us over.

I did not have a good experience with Southwest Airlines. I received an email from Southwest on Wednesday night indicating that my Thursday morning flight back from Boston to Denver had been cancelled due to weather. I had heard from my brother-in-law, who used to fly Southwest frequently, that they had a very strict weather cancellation policy, so out of curiosity, I went to check if all flights into Denver were cancelled, or if Southwest was just falling back on their strict weather cancellation policy. I found that both JetBlue and Spirit flights were still scheduled to arrive in Denver on time, which would lead me to believe that although Denver airport conditions may not have been ideal, they were safe enough for commercial airlines to fly in. Denver International Airport was even indicating that they had 4 of their 6 runways open. I called the number Southwest included in their flight cancellation email to reschedule my flight. After waiting on hold for about 1.5 hours, I was disconnected, so I called them back immediately only to wait on hold for 2 more hours. Once I was finally able to get through to a customer service representative to reschedule my flight, the representative told me that the absolute soonest flight they could get me on was not until Sunday, 4 days later. My husband and I had plans to go up to the mountains for the weekend and flying back into Denver on Sunday would have caused us to miss our entire trip. So I called AMEX Travel, as I had booked through them initially, and they were able to get me on a United flight leaving Saturday…one day earlier than the Southwest flight. At this point I was really wishing I would have booked with JetBlue or Spirit, as now I would be stuck in Boston an additional 3 days that I had not planned for. This means 3 more nights in a hotel, 3 more days of having to purchase food, and 3 more days of missing work. If this wasn’t inconvenient enough, my husband and I were also not going to be able to make our trip to the mountains, which we had already planned. Just for fun, I added up all the costs that stemmed from Southwest cancelling my flight. Hotel: $150/per night x 3 nights = $450 (prices had gone up over the weekend due to the St. Patrick’s Day holiday) Food: about $10/meal x 9 meals = $90 Missed days of work: $22/hr x 24 hrs (3 8 hr workdays) = $528. Total amount lost due to Southwest cancelling my flight because of their “strict weather policy” = $1,068 (this is not including the money that was already spent on our trip to the mountains that we were not able to take). I don’t know many people who can afford to just lose out on that amount of money. Southwest did end up refunding my cancelled flight, which naturally they should, considering they cancelled it. In addition, when I called in to see if they could offer any other kind of compensation, they offered me a $150 Southwest flight voucher. They indicated that because the flight was cancelled due to weather, the cancellation was out of their control and is not their fault. I beg to differ.

"""being money hungry""",1,2018-09-15,"Not Verified |  Orlando to Las Vegas. Southwest is being money hungry and also dismissive to concerns on program and pricing changes. And they used a bait and switch method. I booked my flights some time ago and was offered the early bird check in option at an additional cost of $60 RT for my wife and I. I went back to book it and now the price is $100. When I called, I was told that the program changed at the end of August. Mind you the $60 is already a fee to get checked in early so you have a better boarding group time so you can rush on and pick your seats. The other airlines allow you to select a seat at booking so you do not have to get on the plane searching for your seat and beat out someone else like it is the last bottle of water before a hurricane. I would have saved money going with another carrier and not had to pay for the privilege of getting a better line up position to then still have to search for two seats together where we would like to sit. I talked to a few lower level staff that agreed with me that I should be able to get the original rate I was quoted at the time of booking. However, they could not help me. They did say they are getting similar feedback and it is not going over well. I called corporate at their direction and that got worse. The person at corporate was unapologetic and cold professional. She informed me that basically it is an ancillary rate and they have the right to change it at any time. She did understand my point about being offered a price on an already booked flight but was unwilling to do anything to assist. She then said they notified people by placing a disclaimer on their site for 8 days at the end of August. I had already purchased my ticket and have the app so had no reason to go back on the site. No email or reaching out to someone that already purchased. So they took what was already a junk fee for something no one else charges for and increased it to make more profit. She said well at the lower cost too many people were using it so it was not really an advantage to those buying it. And based on that feedback they felt raising the price to reduce the number of people purchasing it would make it more valuable for those buying it. I mean they could have just limited it to the first 50 people that purchase it or something like that. So buy early and get the advantage. That is how the best seat assignments work on other airlines. Instead they would thin the heard by raising the price and pricing people out in order to make it a better experience for those that can and are willing to pay. It is a greedy money grab. They sell themselves as different, and better and “we got rid of assigned seats and tickets to make fares lower.” But really it just is good marketing because they intend to get it from you on the backend. In all actuality I could have gone with another airline and saved and had seat assignments and not had to pay an extra fee. And this day and age no longer do they really have to print that many paper tickets with tickets on phone apps.

What Southwest fails to mention is that the person who paid for the trip is not the one that is allowed to use the funds, its only the ticketed passenger. The lady I spoke to in customer service was extremely rude and told me the policies were clearly stated on the cancellation email (I looked- they are not). It is the worst customer service I have ever experienced from a company to date. I travel a lot and would rather take my business elsewhere then ever deal with such rude, hostile customer service again, especially from a company who prides themselves on transparency when that clearly is not the case!

That was until today. We purchased 2 round trip tickets to go to a wedding. A couple days after booking our trip, we decided we wanted to stay a day longer, and that we would update our reservation. The website clearly stated that changing our flight would make the reservation non-refundable. It instructed that we should instead, cancel our reservation, then make a new reservation, in case anything happened and we needed to make another change. So, we cancelled the initial reservation, and booked a new one. After a couple weeks, we hadn't seen the refund for our initial purchase. I called customer service and they informed me, that apparently I had purchased a non-refundable ticket initially, and wouldn't be refunded the $650 I paid. I advised them of what the website said, they acknowledged that my understanding of the instructions ws correct, but only for ""refundable"" tickets. Nowhere did it prompt me that I was cancelling a non-refundable ticket, and it wasn't clearly stated during my purchase that these were non-refundable. The only place it was made known to me was in the confirmation email and even then, it was in black font, it was in a pale gray font at the very bottom. The customer service agent advised it wasn't refundable and couldn't help me. She transferred me to her supervisor who again stuck by the non-refundable label. it wasn't as if I cancelled altogether. I bought another reservation for $50 more!

She apologized ""that I felt that way"" and offered me a customer service number to call instead. Southwest advertises, and prides themselves on their excellent ""customer service"", but this is a pure exploitation of a technicality and not at all the way a customer should be treated.

I have always given our dog Melatonin to help her sleep while we fly (to avoid her ears popping/hurting). She was given Melatonin before boarding so she was already in her carrier as we boarded. We sat in our chosen aisle, me sitting closes to the window and my husband in the aisle seat so we could put our carry on bags in the middle seat while we got settled and I juggled two drinks. A flight attendant decided to approach us and say ""What's in the bag?"" to which my husband answered, ""a dog."" Terry then said, ""Okay, it needs to go under the seat."" No problem, we know that already so we said, ""Okay, we're just getting settled with our bags and will make sure to put her under."" He then came back I kid you not within one minute to proceed saying, ""The dog needs to go under the seat."" At this point we were getting a little upset. Once again my husband said, ""We know."" He then stayed right behind our seat while I gathered my sweater and tried putting my carry on away. I looked at my husband and mumbled, ""Gosh, can we put our seatbelts on?"" At that time, the FA very abrasively turned around, stepped into our aisle, and proceeded to yell at me saying, ""Yeah you can put your seatbelt on!"" I looked at him like a deer in headlights and said, ""Okay, I think you need to take it down."" He then stopped the rest of the passengers from boarding and continued yelling at me saying, ""Take what donw, tell me what I need to take down?"" By this point my husband and I were visibly upset. I again said, ""Take it down."" but again he continued to yell at me and say, ""I did nothing wrong!"" My husband said, ""Actually, you're yelling at us for no reason so you are wrong.""  He was the most ill behaved employee I have ever encountered in customer service. Not one single flight attendant told him to walk away nor did they try to deescalate the situation. There were people recording this. Finally he stormed off. I began crying. The entire ordeal was disrespectful, disgusting, and completely unacceptable. I pay $95 dollars each way (just like every other person who flies with their pup) so by no means was any favor done for me to have my dog accommodated for. In addition, we have flown with her numerous times and have never had such a disgraceful and distasteful experience.

Plus, their open seating policy (seat wherever you want) is really a terrible thing to offer if you are not a solo traveler. The reason is because the frequent flyers always benefit from priority boarding (and a lot of SW passengers do) and you are entitled to be in the second half of the boarded passengers. If you are not a solo passenger, you would probably end up split to multiple rows, because all the already boarded passengers with frequent flyer accounts are usually travelling alone and all of them like to seat on A, C, D and F seats, meaning when you enter the plane and you see almost empty seats B and E, but almost all A,C,D,F full, it's really pitiful view - again, this applies if you are a couple, family or a group of friends.",True,Boeing 737,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Las Vegas,May 2018,2,2,,3,5,,True,

"""It felt like a brush-off""",1,2018-05-08,"Ft Lauderdale to Kansas City. We had a very troubling experience with my 6-year-old son flying as an unaccompanied minor on Southwest. He was bumped (although he had a confirmed seat) in favor of standby passengers. Southwest says it was because he didn't have a boarding pass, which apparently can happen even if you check in at the ticketing counter with an actual person who has you sign all the Unaccompanied Minor paperwork and gives both you and your child documentation to go through the security checkpoint. It wasn't a boarding pass! When I called Southwest to get my son onto a different flight, they put him as ""standby"" on a flight going out on Monday morning -- two days later -- and waived the $260 ""change fee."" I called back, asking if he could fly out from a different airport the next day (instead of two days) and they said he could, but I'd have to pay the ""change fee."" They said nobody with the authority to waive the ""change fee"" would be in the customer relations office until Monday morning (the day my son was scheduled to fly as a standby passenger.) Ultimately, I went on Facebook and made a public post. This got results. Southwest changed my son's ticket to a different city so he could depart the next day, with a confirmed seat, and without a ""change fee."" (Kind of proves that there was somebody in the office who had the authority to waive the ""change fee"" at the time they told me I'd have to wait until Monday to talk to someone with that authority.) Then, Southwest didn't answer a bunch of specific questions like, ""What time was my son's confirmed ticket released so that a standby passenger could board?"" and, ""What protocol did the gate agent follow to contact my son's guardians when the gate agent realized that an unaccompanied minor who had checked in at the ticketing desk had not yet picked up his boarding pass?"" In Facebook message, Southwest representatives sent me copies of their ""Unaccompanied Minors"" page of guidelines from their website. They were trying to prove that my son had forfeited his confirmed seat by failing to arrive on time. In fact, the ""Unaccompanied Minors"" page links to another Southwest website page called ""suggested airport arrival times"" which says only that passengers should arrive at the Ft. Lauderdale 60 minutes early for domestic flights. When I pointed out that my son had met these requirements (although NOT the more stringent time requirements being described after the fact by the customer service representative) the Southwest representative wrote, ""I certainly regret if the information your family relied on was not the information provided on the specific Unaccompanied Minor page."" No, ma'am, it was linked on the Unaccompanied Minor page, and there was no other information on the Unaccompanied Minor page. Basically, Southwest representatives bumped my son out of his confirmed seat. Then, they lied to me by saying nobody with the authority to waive the ""change fee"" was available to help me reschedule his flight until Monday. Then, they blamed my family for not following arrival guidelines that were not actually published, and told me that the guidelines we followed (from their public website!) were the wrong ones.

See, the seats have no padding. NONE. They seem to be made out of cardboard. There is not just no lumbar support or seat padding: it's shaped oddly the opposite that seating for humans dictates: the lumbar region of the seat goes back rather than forward toward your back, and the seat curves up at the part right under your upper-upper thigh (the seats are also the shortest depth of all seats). While you are hunching your shoulders forward to avoid being shoulder to shoulder with strangers, you have to bring your elbows in front of your chest and hold them there, while your lumbar region is being pushed into an outward curve by the back of the torture seat and your legs have circulation being cut off by the upward curve of the seat edge.

Ready to head to the Atlanta airport to catch our flight (2419) back to Dallas Love Field, we received an elctronic message stating that our flight was cancelled due to thunderstorms over Dallas. We called home (Dallas) to check with our house sitter and other friends to hear what the weather was like. They said there were no storms at all. It was clear skies and very hot. I checked my weather app and saw no storms in the DFW area. We called Southwest customer service who said we could spend the night in a hotel in Atlanta and catch a flight to Dallas the next morning. But we needed to get back to work the next morning (a Monday). We asked for reimbursement for the 4 tickets we will need to by from other airlines. SWA Rep said we would need to call Customer Relations. But a refund is not possible since the cancellation was due to weather! When we arrived at the Atlanta airport we ran to the American Airlines ticket window and bought the last 2 AA tickets flying to DFW that evening for $536.40! AA ticket counter rep told us all flights to Dallas and DFW airports were flying with no weather issues. So we let our son’s mother and elderly grandmother have these 2 tickets since we were not sure there would be any other available flights out that night. Then we ran to the other end of the terminal to the Delta ticket counter. We bought 2 tickets to DFW for $654.32! Delta also confirmed no weather issues flying into the DFW area. The total for 4 tickets including terminal fees cost us $1,217.72! I called SWA Customer Relations the next day to inquire about a refund for the 4 tickets we had to purchase due to the SWA cancellation. We spoke to SWA Customer Relations rep at the corporate office in Dallas TX. He said no refund is given when a cancellation is made due to weather. He said the FAA said there were thunderstorms over Dallas. I shared that I called friends in various locations in Dallas and NO ONE saw a single could in the sky. I shared that ALL other airlines were flying from Atlanta to Dallas that afternoon and evening with no knowledge of storms in Dallas. SWA refused to offer even partial compensation.

First let me say that SWA has always been our airline of choice, but yesterday we experienced terrible customer service, and I do not know if we will ever fly with them again. At the Ft. Lauderdale airport our flight was delayed by an hour and a half. We asked to re-rout the remainder of our flights, but we were assured that we had plenty of time to make all of our flights, so we had no need to re-rout. Our flight touched down in Nashville to allow more passengers to board the plane, the flight was then held on the ground to allow passengers that had been re-routed time to board the plane so that they could make connecting flights. We asked for help from the flight attendants, but were told it was out of their hands. When the flight landed in Denver we had fifteen minutes to catch our connecting flight, but the pilot announced that we could not get a gate, so we were held on the tarmac until after our flight left. At this point we went to the gate to ask for help and were told that we were held in Nashville so that many more people could make connecting flights, it was a business decision to hold us up so that more people could make their flights. We were told that we had been rebooked on the first flight out the next morning at 6:50 am (it was 10:00 at this time). I asked to speak to a supervisor because we now had to spend an unplanned night in Denver ""so that more people could make connecting flights, a business decision."" The same supervisor refused to give us a hotel voucher stating that he had already given away all vouchers for the day, but offered us a worthless coupon for a ""discount"" on a Best Western hotel room ($157-unsure when he could have a shuttle pick us up) or a no name hotel for $69 no shuttle. We ended up spending $234 at the Westin on the airport property since we had to be back at the airport for our flight in 6.5 hours by the time all of this transpired. The next day when we got home and claimed our luggage, it was wet, with the clothes inside soaked.

On the return flight - the copilot actually came down the aisle and introduced himself and wished everyone a good flight - nice touch. My issue came with the connecting gates in San Diego - Gates 1, 1A and 2. The first flight from Sacramento to San Diego - I had to change gates. Much to my surprise, I had to go through TSA security again because you walked from a secure area to a non-secure area. Even though I purchased a bottle of water in a secure area at the originating gate - I had to toss it because of the 2nd TSA security screen. On the way back - I had purchased a few items from the gift shops while waiting for my flight. Unfortunately, I had to change gates in San Diego - and had to go through the 2nd TSA security screen again. During this screen, I was told I could not keep a bottle of jelly I had purchased in the gift shop (receipt still in the bag) because it was over the limit - how incredibly ridiculous is that? I wasn't leaving the area without my purchased jelly - I didn't break any rules and I was going to be penalized due to SWA sending passengers on connecting flights through those gates. At one point I was told to just go back and get my luggage and place the jelly in my luggage - seriously? I just got off a plane and am in the process of going to a gate for my connecting flight - how on earth am I supposed to go get my bag? After speaking to the TSA supervisor and making it very clear I was not leaving without my jelly - the TSA agent decided they would test the jelly for whatever they test liquids for and then wrapped it up and handed it back to me after it passed the test.

For goodness sake SWA, use a little common sense and fix this issue.

Found a crew and then the crew cancelled at 2am. They then made me wait in a line for 3 hours to change my flight. I was in the airport for 12 hours straight and all they provided me was a mini bag of mini pretzels and 6oz water. They refused a hotel, transportation and food after keeping us in an airport for 12 hours just to cancel the flight. They expected me to travel for 24 hours straight starting at 6am. Meaning they wanted me to stay up for 48 hours straight. I get on the flight for 24 hours later, a direct flight and they delayed my 6.20pm flight until 10.45pm.

Around 1 am I get a notification that the flight has been cancelled. I wish it could have gotten cancelled earlier so we could make accommodations as to where to sleep. I don't understand how you don't have a pilot. And if that's the case, then please just tell us with time so we can make accommodations. People started running to Southwest counters and we were notified that only 2 counters were open. They said you can call and rebook or wait in line at the counter.

I told her I needed to think it over and I would come back but really I wanted to not be taken care of by her. I went back in line and got another representative.

This was the first time I had flown Southwest in several years, never having had a problem in the past. This time was different!

The delay on my return flight 2 days later was twice as long--3 hours--and for the same reason. By then, my patience was exhausted, so I asked for more information from the gate attendant. She informed me that our particular scheduled aircraft had not experienced any problem but instead had been rerouted to the west coast from Chicago to replace a plane that had been delayed for several hours while undergoing repairs, in other words, another ""plane switch."" That plane was instead used to ferry us to Wash., DC. Had repairs taken longer, we would have been stuck even longer in Providence, unless Southwest had decided to spread the misery even more. Southwest offered no alternative flights on other airlines nor did they offer a voucher as compensation for the delay.

I have always attempted to fly Southwest Airlines in the past, whenever traveling (domestic) to a location that they have service to, and I generally try to avoid American Airlines.

In the last couple of years I have come to expect that, unless I am flying on the very first flight of the day, I will be delayed. I have mentally added that time to overall travel time, when planning a trip. Southwest always seems to deliver that midday delay, and I now expect it. Today, Southwest outdid themselves. I think I may finally reached the point where voluntarily flying is perhaps no longer worth it. Maybe I would rather stay home. There have been several moments today when I wished that I could leave the airport and just go home. Why am I so set on spending the time and money to somewhere else anyway?

Yes - Southwest had a computer meltdown and their flights were all messed up. This has happened before to them and other airlines. But alas it always comes down to how an airline handles things like this that differentiates them from others. My nephew is Italian and doesn't speak English fluently and is 14, so I needed to get the Escort pass from the ticket counter. The line was over 1,000 people long if not more, stretching into back halls. I told the SW agents at the line entrances I just needed to get the Escort pass as he can't go thru alone. No - no help. Rude people who just say - get in line. There was no one at the Business Fare line - literally no one - and she wouldn't just let me go up there to get the pass. I had used a Skycap to check his bag in as that line was only 50 people long, so literally just needed the agent to give me the pass. Not a single SW person helped me - but going back to the Skycap - he did! He stopped what he was doing and walked me back to the counter and had an agent quickly issue me the pass. So simple - didn't really stop the process of handling other passengers. Just for this I wouldn't fly SW again - there was no reason the Biz counter couldn't have helped me (and 2 other passengers needing just a quick minute with an agent. So we go thru security - eat and go to the gate where it says ""on time"". Some flights delayed, some cancelled, some on time. They board other flights, at our boarding time they have people line up, flight attendants already on board. Then an announcement: ""Flight 536 is cancelled, we have no pilots, please get in line for rebooking"". No apology - in fact the 4 hours at Midway not a single SWA agent said I'm sorry for what was happening - just deal with it. So I get on the SWA app and the only flight I can get for my nephew is on the 23rd of June. Ok - so now ask an agent how I can get his bag. No - no way, we are not pulling bags from flights. I said he is 14 and has no clothes here as he is visiting. Sorry - we are not pulling bags. I said some choice words to her and then she says to speak to a supervisor. Wait 45 min in line - the supervisor says no - with a smile - and I can try to go to baggage claim and see if someone there would help. So I go to baggage claim - and the agent there is friendly - but she is just guiding people as that line is 20 people long. She said the bag will go to ABQ and just let it go. If I wait in the line they may not pull it, or if they do it could be hours. At least she was friendly. So for 2 days my nephew will not have any of his things - not a dire situation - he can wear my clothes. But again - it was just the sheer nature of the SWA agents.

"""lose sight of what made them""",6,2016-01-06,"Ontario to Sacramento. This is more of a review on the so called rapid ""reward"" program of Southwest. I fly routinely from Southern California to Sacramento and had built up points to qualify for the ""A"" list of the reward system. I knew I was going to be a little short on the required points but I also had a flight scheduled for the 30th December. I ended up purchasing the tier qualifying points and knew I had the points coming from the flight that was scheduled on the 30th which would have put me way over the needed points. So when I inquired about the status I was told that the flight on the 30th December did not count for 2015 but rather for 2016. When I asked for an explanation I was told something that did not make sense and questioned the person about this that all of a sudden the explanation changed, I then asked for a refund of the tier points that I had purchased as was told ""Sorry but you should have known those were non-refundable? When I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told this person who refused to give me his name was the Executive Director of customer relations. He then stated, ""Sorry but there is nothing that he can do"". He didn't even try to make it right but rather tried to come up with different excuses. Also he knew very little about the policies as I was placed on hold several times while he consulted with another co-worker.

"""excellent customer service""",10,2016-01-06,I get terribly motion sick so I have chosen to drive for years. This trip from Charlotte to New Orleans via Houston driving was not an option. I was anxious that I would be sick and miserable the whole flight. Thankfully I was not and the Southwest Airlines crew were friendly and funny. On both legs of the flight we were delayed a bit due to bad weather but the connecting flight waited for the 40 or so passengers to arrive. Unfortunately due to the flight delay our baggage wasn't transferred in time so once we arrived in New Orleans we had to go to the desk and submit a baggage ticket. The women at the desk were patient even though I was about to lose my mind! They located our luggage on the next flight and promptly brought it our hotel and they gave us an airport meal voucher and 2 drink vouchers even though we decided not to wait. The trip back home was just a pleasant and our luggage arrived with us. I will be flying again in 2 weeks and again over the summer on Southwest. I like the reasonable fares and the free baggage but the excellent customer service shown by Southwest will keep me a loyal customer.

"""an error in judgement""",1,2015-12-30,"This flight was set to depart about 9:20pm on Dec 28, from Orlando to Birmingham, the first delay was to 10:15 pm and came out about 6:05pm. So they knew they had a problem at 6pm. It appears the problem originated due to the St Louis flight not being able to come into Chicago due to sleet and severe weather, hence the Chicago to Nashville leg of the flight was also delayed. The flight we were scheduled for was to come in from Nashville. Southwest is a point to point airline as I was told by customer service today, (after holding for 90 minutes) which means if a previous leg is delayed or canceled there is no plane to pick you up. So know where your plane is coming from and check its flight status. We were told another plane was being routed from Dallas to Nashville to pick up passengers and come to Orlando to be our plane from Orlando to Birmingham. The delay was again changed from 10:15 to 11:55 then to 12:55 am. A plane did arrive at 12:20 and we were told it was our flight. Only to be told at 12:50 am that the pilot has too many hours and cant fly you to Birmingham after all, so we are now at 12:50 am going to officially cancel the 9:20 pm Flight and we cant get you on another flight till 9:20 pm the next day. My concern in calling customer service was to ask that the process be reviewed in regard to how this flight delay then cancelation was handled as obviously a mistake was made in telling the passengers they had a plane coming with a delayed departure time set for 12:55 am and yet no one in command for Southwest was checking flight hours for the pilots to realize there was no way this flight was leaving Orlando. The customer service rep said she could only report my concerns to management but I did not have the right to ask for an explanation or any admission they had made an error in judgement on when the flight should have been canceled. I just wanted to know they would look into it and determine a better method to communicate flights, delays and pilot and crew travel restrictions so that this type of very avoidable error doesnt happen agsain. Southwest cannot control the weather and they will continue to be a point to point airline operation but get some people who can do math to determine flight hours limitations for pilots and crews in these situations so after a 4.5 hour delay you are not told the flight now has to cancel because of pilot has to many hours to fly. If you are making these types of errors what else is happening behind the scenes? Also I would just like an email from management that they are looking into this for enhancement or correction and wa stold no way your getting any admission from us about why this happened.

We boarded with no trouble. Our plane was a 737-800, with the split scimitar winglets. I loved the plane, and it offered a smooth as can be ride. Beverage service was provided with small cups, but enough to quench my thirst. As usual, Southwest provided peanuts and pretzels. The last time I flew (2013) I was provided 2 bags of pretzels, but this flight I was given crackers and peanuts. The legroom on board was pretty acceptable, normal for a Southwest flight. The landing was the worst part, though. We had to go around to make way for a smaller plane, and as soon as we landed, it was the bumpiest I had experienced.
