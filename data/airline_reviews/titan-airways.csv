"""Many thanks for fetching us home though, Titan""",10,2022-07-24,"Not Verified |  Brilliant...a bit shook up to be taken to a plane covered in Jet2 branding. ‘Is this the right one? Are we being kidnapped?’ But the staff were super. The pilot sounded as annoyed as us passengers when he informed us that despite us all getting on board in very good time, we may be delayed by 1h 15m (presumably because other planes due to depart before us being delayed). He must have argued the case very well as we were only 35 minutes late taking off. It was also a 757, rather than a 737 which undoubtedly Jet2 would have used. This meant that once up in the air, it became apparent there was lots of empty rows. Anyone that fancied a kip could get themselves a row and bed down for the flight. Only downside was none of the cabin crew stood in for Jess Glynn and sang ‘Come And Take My Hand’. The end of holiday experience just missed that little touch.

There was snow at Innsbruck, we had 2 abortive landings and 2 landings at Munich - 1 to refuel and 2 to be finally diverted there. This was meant to be a 1.5 hour flight, We were in the air for about 6 hours. I am a terrible passenger and did not enjoy the flight one bit. However, the captain, looked after our safety, kept us informed and although I was in a state, they were terrific.

"""no hesitation in recommending""",8,2020-01-14,"Gatwick to Banjul . Surprisingly comfortable 6 hour journey to The Gambia for Christmas. The cabin was clean, crew were friendly and helpful and the flight was comfortable. I didn't suffer from my skin and eyes drying out as much as with other airlines. I got the feeling they didnt stint on the air quality. The food was fine and typical of airline food. There was plenty of water, juices, tea and coffee and you could buy booze if you wanted. The wines were very nice. Outward on 20 December we flew a Boeing 767 with 2-3-2 seating layout and on return 31 December it was an A320 with 3-3 seating. The seats on the A320 felt more spacious and comfortable although they had no adjustable headrest like the Boeing. We are both tall and it was no hardship. The time passed pretty quickly - perhaps also due to the decent times of the flights and the same time zone both ways. The only negative was the lack of working entertainment - although they have an app for your phone - it didnt work and headphones were not issued. Outward on the Boeing I was able to listen to their radio stations on my seat controls through my own earphones and on return I'd downloaded some movies on my mobile phone . I have no hesitation in recommending Titan Airways who I believe sub contract for other airlines when they are busy.
