"""a short flight and a good experience""",7,2022-04-06,"Ground staff friendly and professional. Limited facilities at Albrook Airport but functional. Couldn't do online check in but was smooth at the airport. Older plane but was on time and smooth flight. No real on board service so take your own snack or drink after airport security. Flight was only 50mins so not a problem. Plane does have a toilet. It's not like flying a major international airline, but its a short flight and was a good experience. They even gave us umbrellas to walk to the plane as it had started to rain which was a nice touch. I'd seen other negative reviews so was pleasantly surprised how professional and polite their staff were. I'd use them again. It's difficult to rate the actual on board service because there really isn't any, no entertainment or food / drinks but it's such a short flight it's not that relevant. So I base my score on the overall experience. Good service and on time flights with friendly staff but in flight service not really offered.",True,Fokker 50,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Panama Albrook to Bocas Del Toro,March 2022,3,2,,5,3,,True

"""never recommend such an airline""",1,2021-07-09,"Not Verified |  The worst airline I have ever been in my life and I travel 2-3 times a year on international airlines. This airline has excessive prices since it does not have much competition, internal flights in Panama have a similar cost to an international flight to the United States. Also their prices are excessive, they have a no reimbursement policy and if you get sick with COVID or some other disease and you cannot travel, they will not reimburse you a penny. I would never recommend such an airline.",False,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,July 2021,1,1,,1,1,,False
"""placed me on imaginary waitlist""",2,2019-12-30,Panama City to Bocas Del Toro. Arrived at the airport an hour before my flight to find out I was switched to a different flight two hours after my scheduled flight. They told me I was informed by email which was a lie. The Air Panama staff acted annoyed and placed me on an imaginary waitlist by literally writing me last name down on a blank piece of paper and told me to keep checking and of course there was no room on any earlier flight every time I checked. I recommend using Copa or really any other airline if possible.

"""Air Panama get the job don""",6,2019-10-18,"Panama City to Bocas del Torro. After reading reviews i was not looking forward to flying Air Panama. But the experience i had with them on the day of the flight was nothing as to what has been written. Check-in was fast, there is no online checking available as far as i could find. The plane was an old Fokker 50. Boarding was fast, we had to walk from the terminal to the plane. Once in the plane you could see the age (and there was a nasty smell onboard). We departed 15 minutes early. The seats were comfortable and plenty of legspace. It was a 40 minute flight, a drink and snack were served by 2 friendly flight attendants. Air Panama get the job done and I didn't have horrible service described by other people. It was fast and efficient nothing more and nothing less, maybe an upgrade in their fleet could do magic for them.y.",True,Fokker 50,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Panama City to Bocas del Torro,October 2019,5,5,,4,5,,True
"""We really enjoyed this flight""",8,2019-04-26,"Albrook (Panama City) to Bocas del Toro. After reading comments about this airline I was a bit worried but our flight with Air Panama was really okay. Checkin at the airport was quick, there were no lines. My bag was 17 kg so I had to pay 9 dollars for the 3 kg overweight. Totally fine. There are no infoscreens at the small airport of Albrook but as there are only leaving a couple of flights a day its obvious when boarding starts. The flight left at 2.30, so right on time. The fokker 50 used for this flight is old but seatpitch was okay for this 55 minute flight to Bocas. After a loud and bumpy take off the crew handed out some crisps and a soda. After 35 minutes of cruising with some wonderful views at the rainforest and Caribbean beaches, the pilot started decent into Bocas airport. After a soft landing and a short taxi to the small apron our luggage appeared within minutes. We really enjoyed this flight in this old air Panama fokker-airplane.",True,Fokker 50,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Albrook (Panama City) to Bocas del Toro,April 2019,3,3,,4,4,,True
"""airline is terrible""",1,2019-04-18,"Panama City to David. This airline is terrible. They made my 5lbs Yorkie go in the luggage area. They wanted me to buy one of their containers.

"""Absolutely the worst airline""",1,2018-09-28,"Panama City to Bocas del Toro. This is back to the 70s. Absolutely the worst airline I ever flew. We came to the airport and they told us the flight is moved to 5 pm and the return is cancelled too and we can only take the next one at 10am. It meant we will never reach our flight to Colòmbia as it was 2hrs later. No one to talk to,. After screaming we got a letter saying that they deleted 2 flights and because of that we are stuck. Sadly Copa Air didn't care about the letter and we had to pay a penalty. We will pursue with them when we are back home.

"""Worst airline ever!""",1,2018-08-05,"Bocas del Toro to Panama City. Our Air Panama flight just got canceled, because they could combine two flights in one. No heads up in advance, just the message when we arrived at the checkin desk. We had to wait for 3 ours so they can get a higher profit, no compensation what so ever, not even a drink.

"""never fly Air Panama""",1,2018-04-05,"Worst Airline ever. We flew from Panama City to Bocas and back to Panama City and had a 2,5 hour delay each way. The bad thing about that is not the delay itself but the lack of communication. As there are no displays at the airport we had to ask every 10 min when we will proceed or what the current problem is. The staff first didn't say anything and dissappeared to the back office. A half hour later it was said that the airplane has a ""preventative maintenance"" - how can you have a planned maintenance when the plane should be in the air? Overall it was a lie, as our plane arrived two hours later with passengers on board. The planes are very old with a ""museum smell"" in the cabin. Now we are on our way back from Bocas to Panama City and have a 2,5 hour delay again. This was communicated 10 min before boarding... let's see when and if we arrive.

"""don't recommend this airline""",1,2017-01-18,"✅ Verified Review |  This airline has a really problem and seriously I have no idea how this company is still working. Firstly, the tickets were not cheap for a ""low cost airline"" with very bad conditions airplanes (I don't know which type of model is, but looks likes second hand airplane.  We paid for the round trip 487USD. The flight was suppose that should be depart at 9:00 am arriving to Bocas del Toro at 10:00 am, at the end we depart around 2:30 pm and we were really angry because we lost our tours and our plans for that day. We didn't receive any explanation for the delay. We asked for a reimbursement, because in Europe if the airline has a delay of three hour you receive a percentage of your money back. In this case, we had a delay of five hour, and when we talked to the customer service, she told us that the airline doesn't has any politic regarding to the reimbursement of money for delays. Seriously! you have to be kidding me - then she told us that the only thing that the airline can give us is the lunch for free, and I answered her that we didn't receive any ""lunch for free"" instead they gave us snacks as potatoes chips, plantain chips, cokes, and rum - for me been diabetic that is not food! I was literally starving because in addition the airport is really small and the facilities are lacking of restaurants, so you can not buy food there. The airport just have two small coffee shops and one small kiosk and they not offer you food either. The customer service was really bad in my opinion because we were asking and asking what was happening without an a proper answer. When you buy the ticket through the website you don't have any option that talk about the insurance of reimbursement in case of delays and this is fault of Panamanian authorities, and they should fix this immediately. In summary. I don't recommend this airline neither the airport facilities.
