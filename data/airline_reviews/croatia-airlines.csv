The only communication from the cabin crew regarding the move was to ask me whether I would mind moving to let him have the window seat! The airport had no business facilities there was no sparkling wine the food was extremely poor I was not even able to get a second piece of butter for my bread and my baggage with its priority tag was one of the last to arrive at LHR after a 45 minute wait. Considering the large price gap I am left wondering what exactly that money paid for as I am certain that a slice of ham and bowl of cereal cannot cost over 100 GBP themselves?,False,,,Business Class,,,3,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,
Croatia Airlines customer review,,2014-07-15,I had an awful experience on this airline and Lufthansa codeshare flight from FRA to DBV. Firstly the flight was delayed 1 hour in FRA. However what happened next was a true nightmare. As we descended into Dubrovnik the captain informed us due to a problem at the airport we were to divert to Split. After landing at Split and spending 1 hour on the ground we took off for what we thought was Dubrovnik. However after attempting to land the captain turned the flight around and proceeded to Zagreb (only one announcement and no information as to why). We landed at Zagreb at which point the captain and crew left the plane and the passengers with no information. We were given no food and only one glass of water during this entire ordeal. A new crew came on board about 30 min later and several passengers demanded to leave the flight. We finally took off for DBV and landed 7 hours behind schedule. I fully understand that weather issues/operational issues arise but to not give information to passengers and create a sense of panic with the passengers is completely unacceptable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,1,,False,
Croatia Airlines customer review,7,2014-06-05,LGW-SPU onboard older Aircraft A319 with Recaro seating. Inflight catering (sandwich) and beverages provided but no inflight entertainment.

Would fly them again at this reasonable price.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,4,,True,
Croatia Airlines customer review,,2014-03-21,Old aircraft missing armrests and smelly carpets. I fly very regularly between Greece and Croatia and unfortunately this airline is often the only option without routing half way around Europe. The staff are rude and the food terrible. Once I asked why my baggage was not being marked with priority sticker being a star alliance gold member with several airlines and was surprised when the check-in staff didn't know what Star alliance was. 500EUR round ticket Athens/Dubrovnik sometimes costing a lot more if booked less than 2 weeks to travel date. Truly disappointing that this airlines is a star alliance member.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,
Croatia Airlines customer review,8,2014-03-03,Flew Rome to Dubrovnik off peak (which involved 2 stops) last year and I thought they provided great service. We had 3 flights (Rome-Zagreb-Split-Dubrovnik) and they were all on time which made everything perfect. They provided good assistance when we had to go through Customs in Zagreb giving us priority as we needed to take off soon (crew even fought a bit with airport staff to get our passports reviewed faster). Also were very attentive with us as airport staff barely spoke English. Planes were modern and very clean. They provided some snacks but all flights were really short. Will fly them again if I have the chance!,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,True,
Croatia Airlines customer review,10,2013-10-28,Frankfurt-Split-Frankfurt. Old (ashtrays) but very comfortable A320 with the best legroom I've had and soft seats. Only one third full adding to the comfort. Nice sandwich and whisked to Split in only 1 hr and 20 mins. Return flight same quality despite full flight. Quick boarding and departing thanks to small Split Airport. Crew not very friendly. All in all: good value for money (150 euro rtn) would definitely fly again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,3,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,5,,True,
Croatia Airlines customer review,10,2013-10-23,My flight from Barcelona to Zagreb got cancelled. But within 2 hours we were in a 5 star hotel all expenses paid and they really tried to make it all as painless as can be. For a 3 star airline - 5 star service!,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,
Croatia Airlines customer review,5,2013-09-29,Booked cheap flight Gatwick-Split. Outward journey good. Seats comfortable with sufficient legroom. Flight time under 2hours. Food - the worst we have been served. Cabin service - fine. Return journey - half an hour late. The worst seating. Really uncomfortable and very little padding overall. Food as outward journey-awful. They would be better not to serve food just drink. Happy we only paid an economy fare.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,False,
Croatia Airlines customer review,8,2013-09-22,We travelled on 4th September 2013 from LHR to RJK returning on 11th September. Both flights airbus 319 recaro seats comfortable enough for a 2hr flight.

Croatia Airlines customer review,10,2013-06-13,"3 flights London Gatwick - Split and then Dubrovnik - Zagreb - London Heathrow. Both LGW-SPU and DBV-ZAG flights were onboard the same A320 with comfortable blue fabric seats. The ZAG-LHR sector was onboard a A319 with the thin Recaro seats with less padding but adequate legroom. On both flights to and from London a substantial salad sandwich was served (including a vegetarian version for me) followed by a very generous ""old school"" drinks service offering a soft drink wine and tea or coffee. On the domestic sector only a glass of water was served. All flights were more or less on time the connection in Zagreb was efficient but the airport felt very overcrowded. Every Croatia Airlines employee I came in contact with was pleasant and courteous and the value was excellent much cheaper than any ""low cost"" alternative. The in-flight entertainment simply consisted of a promotional video of Croatia on a loop. All in all a very efficient old-style airline with a good solid service offering.

Croatia Airlines customer review,9,2013-02-25,Flight from Zagreb to Paris on 18 Feb 2013 and return on 22 Feb. Flying to Paris with an A319 very clean aircraft in very good condition friendly personnel smooth flight. Flying back to Zagreb with an A320 somewhat older aircraft but in good condition clean. Again friendly personnel very smooth flight. Food was simple in both directions but acceptable for a 1 hour 40 min flight good choice of drinks. Seats somewhat harder but enough space for legs in both aircraft (I'm 193 cm). No entertainment except for a tourist booklet but I don't think it's needed on such a short flight. The view of the Swiss Alps was spectacular. The price was more than affordable with 190 EUR for the return ticket (I booked early).,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,
Croatia Airlines customer review,7,2013-02-07,Flew Zagreb - Frankfurt return. Check in was fast and smooth. Outbound flight on A320 very clean aircraft.

Croatia Airlines customer review,9,2012-12-05,Heathrow to Zagreb 8th November and returned 12th November. I travelled with a sporting rifle and as a result expected to have problems. The booking in going out and returning was smooth and well conducted. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. The flight was smooth and reasonably comfortable for an economy seat. The meal quality has gone down from previous trips but when I consider the price and duration of the flight I think it is very good value. I have difficulty walking so always ask for a seat near the front door and in every case I have been obliged.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,
Croatia Airlines customer review,6,2012-11-30,LHR-ZAG-LHR. Tried checking in online and twice it crashed. At Heathrow I asked the check in agent for an empty row in Economy as I had seen there were several. He sort of grunted and sure enough I was sat in a row with another people so moved to an empty row once the doors closed. Not sure what the dish was it was a cold Croatian pastry filled with cheese not really to my taste. Immigration in Zagreb was disorganised with passengers queuing but those with transfer flights moving to the front so it felt like constantly moving backwards. Bags took a long time to come out despite the fact only a few passengers had checked in. Return journey was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to Business Class. Lounge was compact and the food available were peanuts cake and canapé sized bread that was it. The catfish with cold bean salad was again not to my taste. In London immigration was quick but we did have to wait 30 minutes plus for our bags. It will be interesting to see if Croatian improve the offering on this route with a rival airline launching LHR-ZAG flights from December.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,3,,,5,,True,
Croatia Airlines customer review,9,2012-10-29,LGW-ZAG/PUY-ZAG-LHR. Used Croatia Airlines before and staff attitude and friendliness has changed a lot. On all flights smiley and polite crew. Catering has got worse now a piece of cheese strudel given (although very tasty) with 4 small pieces of honey cake on the side. On 2hr flight drinks offered only once but refilled if asked. On A319 new Recaro seats which are not very comfortable but ok for short flight. On return from ZAG 1 hour delay which was explained and apologised for. The only minus really was baggage handling at LHR waited for over 45 minutes for bags. Good airline offering good product.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,True,
Croatia Airlines customer review,5,2012-10-08,MUC-ZAG in C class. Flight departed and arrived on time. The food for business class was more than disappointing even at that early hour (9am). A very tiny bowl with slices of fresh fruits (mostly melon which is the cheapest) and a small warm croissant. That was it. No butter no jam no cold meats. As for the drinks no champagne or sparkling wine and no refills either. Really not worth the money as the seat pitch is exactly the same as in economy as Croatia does not even leave the adjacent seat vacant on their Dash 8 compared to their competitors.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,4,,,1,,True,

Croatia Airlines customer review,1,2012-09-03,Flew business class Dubrovnik - Zagreb - Istanbul. Both planes small props. (DH4). Meal service almost non existent and very disorderly. But the most annoying part was the A/C. The plane was close to 30C and couldn't cool off until Istanbul which took 2h 20 mins. Seats are very small and leg distance very tight. All together a very bad experience for a lot of money.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Croatia Airlines customer review,10,2012-07-24,ZAG-DBV. Lost their afternoon flight but was rebooked on the evening flight at no extra cost and easily. For a flight of 45 minutes they managed to serve a bottle of water and a cookie with a smile which was highly appreciated. Their A320 was clean with enough space and comfortable seats. The flight had some turbulence but this was dealt with high professionalism from cabin crew. Departed and arrived on schedule. Very impressed with their service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Croatia Airlines customer review,4,2012-07-22,LGW-ZAG-SKP on older A319. First sector delayed about 20 minutes but made up time in the air.

Croatia Airlines customer review,8,2012-07-15,Amsterdam - Zagreb and back. Well maintained and clean A319 airplane. Takeoff was on time the snacks they offered was more than enough for such a short flight and was very tasty. Their new seats were comfortable the crew happy and smiling. Both flights were on time the price of the ticket was not the cheapest option but still good enough for the quality you get.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Croatia Airlines customer review,,2012-05-28,Venice to Dubrovnik. Impossible to get online boarding passes as the drop down menu on the site did not display Venice as a departure point. The day of the flight we arrived 2.5 hours early but could not locate the ticket counter. When we finally found the counter we were third in line with 2 hours before the flight. At the counter we were told that although our names were in the computer no tickets had been issued for us. Four different clerks came to straighten out the problem but after 15 minutes we were moved aside to another window. Fortunately the call did come through from Rome and we were given our boarding passes 40 minutes before the flight by Austrian Air only to find out that the flight was delayed over 2 hours. When we finally boarded staff were unconcerned and handed us a small sandwich. On our final descent into Dubrovnik we were then told that because of high winds our plane was going to be diverted to Split. When we reached Split I tried to explain our situation to a representative and was told to go ahead and complain to the airline but that they would probably do nothing about it. Needless to say a bus arrived 15 minutes later to take the passengers back to Dubrovnik- a 4.5 hour ride. We arrived at our final destination 8 hours late.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,

After problems at BCN we left late good cold dinner served onboard with nice Croatian wine. Worn out A319 curtains closed for Business Class despite it being empty. Arrived only 10 mins late short transit at ZAG where everything was closed despite all the flights arriving/departing at that time.

Croatia Airlines customer review,,2011-06-16,My flight from Zagreb to Dubrovnik was abysmal. I checked in my luggage and had a microscope needed for study at my destination as hand luggage because it was delicate. Every airline in the world has been fine about this as the microscope fits into hand luggage space at the right measurements. The manager on duty that day was behaving in a very negative way and would not let me board the flight unless I put the microscope under the plane in luggage. She said I had to pay for a whole new seat to bring it with me costing 150 euros. I was not able to do that and she would not discuss the issue and insisted it went under the plane She ensured by word of mouth that it would come to no harm or damage. When I took the microscope out of the luggage at my destination it had been badly damaged. I was dismayed. I would like to say that this airlines staff were rude non customer friendly and not helpful at all. In fact worse than that she actually caused my baggage damage with a lie about its safety.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,

Croatia Airlines customer review,8,2011-03-22,London Heathrow to Pristina via Zagreb return. Online check-in was difficult from London. It allowed me to choose my seat then the on-line process failed. On my return on-line check was not available then again it was not available for BA and Swiss who I have used on this route. For a European short haul airline the onboard service was excellent. FA's were friendly and the food good. The longer sector from LHR-ZAG return included a proper cold meal. A full and free bar service. Even on short sector ZAG-PRN included a sandwich and bar. This is welcome given the poor availability of food to purchase at PRN and ZAG. Also the tight transfer time at ZAG restricts any opportunity to purchase food/beverage. The only problem I have with Croatia Airlines is the transfer at Zagreb as the airport is a joke and the tight transfer can be stressful due to slow security processing.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
