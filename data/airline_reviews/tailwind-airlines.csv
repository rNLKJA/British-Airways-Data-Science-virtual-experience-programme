"""the plane was outdated""",6,2019-11-16,"Not Verified |  Brussels to Eskisehir with Tailwind Airlines. Nice flight. The crew was okay, the plane was outdated. The food was okay too, not free or included though. There wasn’t any kind of inflight entertainment. Great if you don’t want WiFi connection or when you don’t want to know where you are.",False,Boeing 737-400,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Eskisehir,September 2019,4,4,,5,4,,False
"""Nobody has ever replied to me""",1,2017-11-21,Antalya to Prague. I tried to claim compensation for the delay and issues that happen on 29th August with flight no TWI757. The plane was supposed to depart on 13:00. Instead the departure was delayed to 16:50. Due to technical issues we landed in Burgas and were not properly informed about exact procedure and next steps. Moreover we didn’t get any refreshment while staying almost 5 hours in Burgas. The overall delay was 8.5 hours which is over 5 hours according to passengers rights document of Tailwing. Nobody has ever replied to me after sending emails and reminders.,True,,Business,Economy Class,Antalya to Prague,August 2017,1,1,,1,1,,False
"""staff were very friendly""",7,2016-09-22,"Brussels to Antalya. Positively surprised, okay we have been on a more recent airplane, but it was certainly ok. The children were well taken care of and the staff were very friendly. Of course there is always one grumpy one, which was also the case during our flights. Closing off the curtain right in front of you while you want to bring your children to the toilet without any apologies, not very polite! The words ‘just a second madam’ would already have been perfect. Besides this we had nice flights.",False,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,BRU to AYT,August 2016,3,2,,2,4,,True
