"""lousy scam or incompetent staff""",1,2022-10-06,"Airline offers cheap flights, but then gets additional income at the airport. We had to prove our departure at the check-in counter and showed the reservation confirmation for the sailing tour to Colombia. The provider was rejected by them and we were immediately recommended to simply buy a bus ticket for a bus that we will not take. I strongly assume that not only Tica Bus will benefit from the income. Otherwise, I wouldn't know why an airport employee who is supposed to document entry and exit recommends a fake bus ticket. Isn't it the employee's job to document the length of stay and the exact date of departure?

"""stay away from this airline""",1,2021-05-12,"Venezuelans, stay away from this airline. We bought tickets from Wingo to travel from Cancun to Caracas. For this destination the airline scheduled a long layover in Bogota. A few days before our flight, Wingo cancelled the Bogota-Caracas portion saying the airline was prevented from flying from Bogota into Venezuela. According to Wingo, this was a force majeure case. This is in no way a force majeure case. When the airline sold me the tickets they knew they were not allowed to flight from Bogota to Caracas while other direct flights from Mexico to Caracas were allowed. The airline tried everything to keep our money and escape liability. It wanted us to take the Cancun-Bogota fligh (because that one was not cancelled), leave us there and reimburse only the Bogota-Caracas portion. When we asked for a full refund to buy the tickets from another airline and be able to go to our destination, they refused saying that they were not responsible for us not being able to enter the country. We are Venezuelan citizens and at that time we were not prevented from entering into Venezuela neither due to the Covid-19 pandemic nor by any other reason. If you know that you cannot flight to a destination, you shouldn't be selling tickets to that destination with the plan to leave the passangers stranded in the layover location. The airline knew it was not going to be able to fulfill the contract as it was entered into and the customer should not be penalized for the airline's short sigh, bad planning or plain shady procedures. The airline cannot profit from its own mistakes and lack of planning. We insisted many times to get a full refund and the airline decided to close our case alleging lack of response from us. Two months later we haven't received the full reimburse nor any explanation from the airline.",True,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Caracas via Bogota,March 2021,,,,,1,,False,

(He is a Venezuelan with an expired passport, and we spoke to the airline MULTIPLE times about this and we were always told it is not a problem as many Latin American countries are letting Venezuelans travel on expired passports for 2 years). Since we were not allowed to board, we wanted to cancel and get a voucher. We were told we had to call the airline to do that. So, after holding for 30 min, we were told we couldnt cancel because it was within the 3 hour window and no cancellations are permitted . (we were at 2 hr and 45 min before takeoff to be exact). I asked to speak to a supervisor and waited another 40 min and guess what! I was told the same thing. Then I wrote them, and guess what! I was told the same thing. I have reached out to them anyway possible and I either dont get a reply or they just tell me its my fault.

"""offered excellent service""",9,2020-02-16,"Bogota to Havana. Since the beginning of my trip planning, Wingo offered excellent service. First of all, it was very easy to book, and as a low-cost airline where you know they will search many ways to make some extra money, they were very clear all the time with what you were able to do if you didn't want to pay more than the plane ticket. Ground service offered the Cuban visa before taking off. I found this a very good quota of service. The flight day I was surprised for them to be so punctual. We started the itinerary on time, arriving at Havana's airport earlier than expected. The seats were really comfortable considering that it is a low-cost airline, comfy legroom plus good in-flight service. They offer a menu with many options to eat in flight, and I consider they have really good prices, and they can get cheaper if you can pay in Colombian Peso due to the exchange tax. If you want to have more extra space in the seat you can pay $20 in-flight or COP 60.000. I recommend Wingo if you don't have a really big budget and if you don't care about having entertainment for international flights.",True,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bogota to Havana,December 2019,3,5,,4,5,,True,

If I had counted on your collaboration I would have been able to request a copy of the card and have been able to address it in a timely manner. It makes no sense to use a low-cost airline to miss the flight. The service is terrible.  1 hora antes de abordar me informaron que las imágenes que tenía del carné de vacunación contra la fiebre amarilla no era suficientes para las autoridades de Aruba, quienes me exigirían el documento físico. Les pedí que me permitieran pasar de nuevo por migración, ya que únicamente podía hacerlo en compañía de una persona de la aerolínea y me dijeron que me acompañarían cuando el vuelo hubiera cerrado.

"""Beware of this airline""",3,2019-08-18,"Not Verified | Mexico City to Bogota. Beware of this airline company! We booked with Wingo because of the cheap flight they offered. Because we know low cost airline companies usually have all kinds of methods to make you pay extra we read carefully all the info that was presented in their website while booking the flight. The night before our flight we did check in on Wingo website and again read carefully everything about the process. In the morning when we came to give our bags and we were informed that we must have a printed tickets (wasn't mentioned no where) and a print screen shot in the phone is not acceptable. Apparently they are the only company that a phone screen shot of the tickets does'nt work in the check point to the security. We had to pay Wingo just for a simple print of paper 600 Mexican peso which is about 30 euro. So rude! Of course, there was nowhere in the airport a place with a printing machine so we had to pay this rip-off. Besides us, there was another couple who had the same story. After arriving in Colombia we went to their customer service in the airport to complain, we demanded to see where was it written that we need to print the tickets, the girls who worked there couldn't find this as well and told us to send an official complaint to the company website. We did, the company refused to compensate us with out a reasonable explanation. Bottom line I think this is just a way to rip people of, very disappointed.
