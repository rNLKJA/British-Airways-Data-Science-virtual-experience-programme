"""The absolute worst airline""",1,2022-08-30,"The absolute worst airline. We had a very disappointing experience with Intercarribean Airways. We fly in to Provo, expecting to catch our hopper flight from Provo to South Caicos. Check in, sit at the airport for 3hrs, then after take off time, they announce that we were bumped from the flight bc they downgraded the plane to 8 passengers. After speaking an on the phone with 4 different customer service call centers and arguing that they need to put us up for the night, we're told its an equally nice hotel and that a taxi would pick us up. The manager and staff leave the airport, their shift is over, we wait for a taxi for another hour with no information and are taken to a motel 6 level motel - nothing like the $600 a night we paid for in South Caicos. The meal voucher they provided didn't cover half of 2 meals at their restaurant of choice. Next day we get up at 7am to head to the airport for 9am flight. 9am rolls around, flight canceled. They'll take us at 12. Because of this, 2 families canceled the rest of their vacation. We waited, a flight finally took us at 1230. If this happens to you, make them comp your breakfast at the airport. I even messaged their CEO on LinkedIn (who has yet to follow up since). We'd never fly with them again which is sad for tourism for the countries they go to where large airlines don't yet travel. Take the ferry, its not as glamourous and its about 90 mins, but at least you're about 99.9% likely to arrive on time with no further issues.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Providenciales to South Caicos,August 2022,2,3,,1,1,,False,
"""Do not fly on this airline""",1,2022-01-29,Not Verified | We arrived in San Juan Jan 8 2022 to discover that our Intercaribbean Flight to Tortola cancelled. We had called Intercaribbean Thursday Jan 7 and we told flight was a go no problems. We had received No communication from the airline. We attempted to call their customer service line but could not even leave a message as voicemail full. There was no Intercaribbean agent in San Juan or in Tortola. In fact we received more help from Cape Air agent and rebooked for Jan 9 am. Overnighting in San Juan and booking Cape Air flights has cost us an additional $1500. We have never received any communication from Intercaribbean. Do not fly on this airline.,False,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Tortola,January 2022,,,,1,1,,False,
"""Cannot recommend the Airline""",1,2021-12-25,"Some drama on our Intercaribbean flight #410 from Tortola to the Dom Republic December 21, 2021. A 90 minute flight, 20 passengers. Marched out on the runway for take off in Tortola, then back while they changed a light. Then back and boarded. Officious female flight attendant gets her chance to be a star with the seat belt and life vest and we are off. But shortly after takeoff it becomes hot. At first a little then a little more. By half an hour barf bags have become fans. The Flight attendant patrols once but makes no announcement or assurance concerning what is clearly a problem. By an hour into the flight there is an odour of smoke and five minutes later you can see it, faint grey. Alarms begin to go off and are very quickly shut down but Attendant. Fellow passengers react, but don’t scream or leave their seats. But the panic is palpable.  No news from Attendant or flight deck. Smoke thickens and I actually began to wonder if this is how it ends.  Then we descend to about 3000 feet and smoke begins to clear as the cabin depressurizes and we rocket over fields to an emergency landing surrounded by hazmat suits and fire trucks. We sit isolated on the tarmac for another 15 minutes before being permitted to disembark. No explanation, no apology: “have a nice day”. Upon arriving home we sorted out our luggage and found several plastic items melted and fused. One, a tube of sun screen, was melted and blackened, very close I think to catching fire. This was very nearly a horrible end and tragedy.

"""incompetence demonstrated by InterCaribbean""",1,2020-01-14,"First InterCaribbean Airways cancelled our flight from Provodenciales to Grand Turk, then they cancelled our departure from Grand Turk with no notice. After multiple phone call and email attempts I have not received a Customer Service reply (other than automated to my online request) to my complaint on dated December 31 regarding reservations number AAX6F9 on InterCaribbean Airways. The 8:40 AM flight from GDT to PLS was cancelled, and InterCaribbean Airways brought in another plane from Jamaica to take passengers to PLS 3 hours later than scheduled. This resulted in our 4 passengers party missing our connecting flight to FLL on Jet Blue at a loss of over $1724.06 (half of the total round trip fare of $3448.12 from FLL-PLS). We then had to purchase 4 additional tickets on Southwest Airlines at a cost of $1101.08. In total we are inconvenienced by InterCaribbean a total of $2825.14 as the Jet Blue flight was not refundable. Our final destination was not FLL, and we had multiple connecting flights that we had to make. We were connected from FLL to Seattle, WA, then onto Anchorage Alaska, and finally proceeding to Kodiak Alaska. It was imperative that we make it to the US Mainland and our connecting flights. Staying in Provo overnight, if we could find lodging over the holiday to wait for a hypothetical flight on InterCaribbean to FLL, was not an option. We would have had a loss of over $8000.00 if we missed our return connections. We are very fortunate that Southwest Airlines had seats remaining as our entire return flight schedule was in jeopardy. I was diligent over our holiday in checking the status of InterCaribbean's flight to GDT since they cancelled our incoming flight and I was forced to book with Caicos Express just to get to Grand Turk a week prior to our departure date. I checked email the morning of the flight for notifications, we were at the airport by 7:00 AM, before ticketing agents were even there. We were not told of the cancelled flight, and rerouting of the new plane until 45 minutes post boarding time or approximately 9:30 AM. InterCaribbean Airways ticketing agent was very courteous, and obviously tried all he could do thereafter, but was basically ineffective. We finally received a refund for the cancellation of the incoming InterCaribbean flight from PLS to GDT a total of 29 days after the cancellation of the flight, and we had to ultimately make multiple request for a refund. I had to call long distance to customer service to request initially. It was not an automatic refund. It also took 2 additional follow up phone calls, and multiple emails to get this $320 refund on a supposed ""refundable"" ticket as it never showed up in my account as a credit. Unacceptable. I incurred $37.00 in long-distance phone service charges just to ensure InterCaribbean Airways did their job. The incompetence demonstrated by InterCaribbean on our return flight was the final straw to a disastrous vacation. Not only did it cost us thousands of dollars, the added stress eliminated any benefit our pathetic vacation supplied.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cockburn Town to Providenciales,December 2019,1,1,,1,1,,False,
"""reputation for cancellations""",2,2019-04-22,Not Verified |  The airline seems to contract out services at BVI. our flight was delayed/cancelled we were eventually put on a later flight with a 4 plus hour delay. The staff didn't know what to do nor did we get a meal voucher just some water. Further they knew of the issues and could have offered the 4 passengers alternatives from Dominica. Instead we were flown to BVI and dumped. Were as there were other airlines flying direct to San Juan. that would have reduced the delay this airline seems to have a bad reputation for cancellations delays etc.,False,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dominica to San Juan via BVI,April 2019,5,5,,1,2,,False,
"""maintenance issues and delays""",1,2019-02-21,"San Juan to Tortola. The company outsources it's operations including gate agents. There is no coordination between the entities. If you have a reservation, it really doesn't matter, as they take people on the planes, first come, first served, bumping those who have reservations, only because they were next in line. The company is non-responsive to complaints or feedback. The planes themselves are not maintained well, as there was no air on the hour flight to Tortola and back, so the inside cabin was 95-100F. This after a day delay to fix a different issue. Expect many  maintenance issues and delays with this airline. Given the number of other choices, I cannot see why anybody would choose this airline.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Juan to Tortola,November 2018,1,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,False,1
