"""Very poor service""",3,2022-02-12,"Not Verified |  Very poor service. 3.5 hours of delay, no compensation. Will never fly again with them.

"""value for money was great""",9,2020-02-26,"Puerto Montt to Santiago. The value for money was great. We got cheap tickets but the processes were all very efficient. No long queues, fast check-in and very friendly staff.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Puerto Montt to Santiago,December 2019,4,5,,5,5,,,True
"""very poor service""",1,2020-01-15,Not Verified | Lima to Santiago. Cheap airline but very poor service at the gate they will make sure you pay more for bags. If the plane is empty and you want to change your seat. You cant. Usually always late by 1 hour. There are advantages of paying less but then be ready for the torture. My friendly advice. Don't travel. Pay more and be happy with other airlines,False,A320,Business,Economy Class,Lima to Santiago,January 2020,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,5,,1,False
"""really bad experience""",1,2019-11-11,"Mendoza to Salta. I had a really bad experience with Jetsmart. First of all, they delay and don't inform customers about what's going on. And second, I flew from Buenos Aires to Mendoza with only a backpack. That was fine, but for my surprise, when I continued my journey towards Salta, they forced me to pay extra $57 due to the size of my backpack, which was the same I used in their previous flight, and had no more than 5kg. I have also used the same backpack for flying in low cost carriers around the world and have never had a problem. In sum, the delay and have very different standards in each airport. Avoid it if you don't want to have surprises and extra expenses with this low cost.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Mendoza to Salta,November 2019,2,1,,1,1,,,False
