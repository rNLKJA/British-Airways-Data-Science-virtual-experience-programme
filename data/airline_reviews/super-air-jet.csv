"""choose another airline""",1,2022-11-04,"Not Verified |  I can't recommend the Airline at all! I booked a flight with them via Booking.com for the 8.10 at 11:15 am and the day before  at 11:30 PM Booking informed me that the flight was cancelled! So less then 12 hours before the flight start and also late at night the flight was cancelled. No support or any information from Super air Jet at all. Also when i requested a refund afterwards they are not responding to any of my mails, so please avoid the unnecessary stress and choose another airline.",False,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denpasar to Jakarta,October 2022,,,,,1,,False,
"""An unhappy customer""",1,2022-10-12,"Super Air Jet is a pretty new airline. As a foreign traveller I had to face their inexperience. The english website collapsed constantly, especially when I tried to cancel my flight in time. After many hours of trying I had to give up. The next day my friend tried it on the Indonesian website of the company and there it worked. But it was too late, I missed the deadline. Still I was guaranteed 10 percent of the base fare. 60 days have passed and I've not received even a penny. In times of Covid 19, it should be possible to cancel the flight online. I would definitely not recommend to use that airline. Unless they do some big changes on their online performance.

"""Totally unreliable""",1,2022-10-09,They just canceled my flight 8 hours before departure and put me in a flight 4 hours before normal departure. I was by complete chance at the airport quite early to be able to fly. Totally unreliable and did not give any refund or reason for cancelation. Booked via Trip.com and they also did not help at all.,True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Lombok to Jakarta,September 2022,1,3,,1,1,,False,
"""two times out of two I was bumped off""",1,2022-10-03,"Second time booked on this airline and second time I got re-booked on a different airline (of the same group) with a different departure time. For this flight I was booked on a late afternoon flight and 18 hours before they changed my booking into a flight leaving five hours earlier. A bit of a nuisance, but such things often happen with domestic flights in Indonesia. Ten minutes before departure the plane was nowhere to be seen, so surely there would be a delay, which eventually was announced. Strangely I received simultaneously a phone call from their mother company, Lion Air, informing the Super Air Jet flight was cancelled and me being re-booked on a Lion Air flight leaving in 30 mins. Officially the original Super Air Jet was not cancelled, and I presented myself at the gate asking for information, telling about the phone call I had received. The gate agent told me I was was right and I would receive a new boarding card. Others were standing at the gate and overheard the conversation and asked the agent why they were not informed, not to mention re-booked or to receive the same service. No answers given to the others and indeed I received five minutes later a new printed boarding pass for my Lion Air flight. I was the only one offered this. Interesting was that the Lion Air flight was 2/3 booked. Upon arrival in Jakarta I checked on my original Super Air Jet flight and saw it left Lombok one hour after Lion Air left. Don’t know what triggered this whole thing, also because the original flight to be taken wasn’t overbooked. On the other hand I was grateful for the re-booking. The conclusion of me flying with Super Air Jet is I would love to write a report about them, if one day they give me the opportunity to effectively fly with them and they don’t re-book: two times out of two I was bumped off.",True,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Lombok to Jakarta,September 2022,,,,2,3,,False,
"""gets high praise from me""",9,2022-06-06,"Jakarta Soekarno-Hatta (CGK) to Yogyakarta (YIA). I was attracted by their advertisement, marketing themselves as a ""millennial airline"" offering a ""millennial experience"" - and sure enough, this new low-cost carrier spinoff of Lion Air has already impressed me right from the start. The ground staff handling transit passengers were very proactive and quick to assist me and my family so that we can transfer from terminal 2E to 1A without having to exit the terminal building. Boarding was conducted 20 minutes behind schedule - and when I stepped into the plane, the fear of this flight getting delayed was swept away by the very energetic, proactive, and friendly cabin crews. Never had I encountered a cabin crew so proactive in assisting me in opening the A/C vents until this ""super crew"" came. That attitude was maintained throughout the flight. We took off 1 hour behind schedule - which is not their fault, and soon after, I got the privilege to try their Wi-Fi-based in-flight entertainment. There were, sadly, no music selections, but they covered that up with never-seen-before contents such as podcasts, vlogs, e-magazines, etc. The seat, still retained from Indigo, was comfortable with slightly more extra legroom due to the slim design. The landing was, obviously, behind schedule, but overall, I do think that this new airline surpassed my expectations and they managed to step up their game, as a low-cost carrier. My only critique is that the flight attendants of this flight used an excessive amount of PA announcements - it could have been made more efficient. Super Air Jet gets high praise from me.",True,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Jakarta  to Yogyakarta,May 2022,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",5,5,,True,4
