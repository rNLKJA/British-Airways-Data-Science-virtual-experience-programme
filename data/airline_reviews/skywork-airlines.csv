"""Another disappointment""",1,2017-12-22,"London City to Bern. Another disappointment. Two weeks ago diverted to Basel after fog in Bern - nearly 3 hours late as bus provided was late. Today, I could see my suitcase at LCY but half the baggage was not loaded - presumably to save weight so the airline could profit from SWISS customers transferring from a cancelled Zurich flight. So no luggage at Bern. Never again - my advice is fly on a solvent airline via Zurich.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London City to Berne,December 2017,1,1,,1,1,,False
"""Service was friendly""",8,2017-08-29,âœ… Verified Review |  Flew SkyWork Airlines from Berlin to Bern. You can e-ckeck in 23hrs before flight. Both flights were on time. Cabin was clean and legroom standard. Service was friendly and they offer coffee and pie for lunch. Airport was small but there was a bus/train connection to the town. I would recommend them.,False,Saab 2000,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Bern,August 2017,4,5,,4,3,,True
