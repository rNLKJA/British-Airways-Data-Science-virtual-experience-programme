"""This company is horrific""",1,2022-08-10,"This company is horrific. We had a cancelation of our flight back home and this airline refused to refund our money. Fly Maya Island Air. They are exceptional, less expensive and very flexible. The planes are also shady. You will not regret flying Maya Island Air! Have a wonderful and safe flight.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,San Pedro to Belize,June 2022,1,1,,1,1,,False
"""Great little airline""",9,2022-04-06,"Not Verified |  Best staff ever. Great little airline. We did 5 flights in all, every one on time. Staff super friendly and helpful. We connected in Belize and got through immigration much faster than expected. They put us on an earlier flight and even called our hotel to pick us up early. Excellent service!!!! Planes are small propeller type, so no real in flight service or drinks etc, also note no toilets on board. Flight from Cancun took an hour and a half so worth keeping in mind. They use the private FBO terminal in Cancun airport so make sure your taxi knows that when going to the airport. All in all super friendly, everything was on time, these are small planes but all were smooth even through dark clouds. Very well organised ground staff, a pleasant change from flying through big terminals on big airlines.",False,Beechcraft / Cessna,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to San Pedro via Belize,January 2022,4,4,,5,3,,True
"""fabulous little airline""",9,2016-03-12,"What a fabulous little airline. We flew Tropic Air from the teeny airport at Tower Hill Belize, which is a metal hut with a single airstrip in the middle of a sugar cane field. Our flight to San Pedro on Ambergris Caye was only 20 minutes. The airport's Tropic Air staff consisted of one friendly gentleman, who didn't ask us for ID because our hotel manager (who drove us to the airport) vouched for us. We met both Tropic Air pilots, who were also quite friendly. Our plane was a little 12-seat single prop beauty that looked very new, inside and out. Hubby and I secured the last seat, bench style and very comfy, with plenty of leg room. There was no cabin staff, no beverages or snacks, not even a commode. But it was a wonderful flight, with wonderful customer service at the airport. We wouldn't hesitate to fly Tropic Air again.",False,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tower Hill to San Pedro,March 2016,5,5,,5,5,,True
Tropic Air Belize customer review,7,2013-07-11,SAP-BZE-FRS. I had two flights with this regional airline this past month! Ssmall grand caravan planes but both clean and spotless! flights on time crew friendly! Due to the size of the aircraft there's no FA on board. Price paid fair I do recommend if you're flying to Belize.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,,,4,,False
