To compound my concerns, I understand that Khmer people returning to Cambodia are not required to obtain a COVID negative test prior to flying, unlike foreigners such as myself. In addition to the poor boarding process, the plane was almost full and being a short haul flight the seats were small and close together.

SilkAir customer review,,2014-09-01,Terrible experience with Silk air from Singapore to Wuhan return. First of all I had pre-booked my Vegetarian meal but I was served non-vegetarian.

SilkAir customer review,9,2014-08-28,Singapore - Manado return. Very nice C class product for a 3.5h flight. Flight on time decent seat pitch good food and efficient and friendly cabin staff.

SilkAir customer review,3,2014-08-28,I travelled from Brunei to Hyderabad via Singapore using Airlines website. Brunei to Singapore was by Singapore airlines where it was a bigger aircraft with good leg room. Singapore to Hyderabad was by Silkair smaller aircraft little leg space bottom line it's Cattle Class. The fare paid is Singapore Airlines service is budget. For certain cities SQ uses Silkair but the fare is SQ.

SilkAir customer review,8,2014-08-20,Took MI for my flight from SIN to Phuket and I must say service standards were far better as compared to Singapore Airlines (the latter service standard dropped drastically over the years). It was a short flight and I wasn't expecting to be full service which includes meal and refreshments. Inflight entertainment is lacking but I am not concerned about it since the flight was short. The airline could do better by providing ear phones for those who didn't want to watch silent movies on board.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,5,2014-07-29,"Danang - Singapore business class. A bit late but nothing too serious. Ipad equivalent handed out but no headphones. On enquiry told ""out of stock"" just this flight I enquire no all flights no headphones. So what is the point of a movie let alone music without headphones? You can get them on cheap airlines for $2 or any cheap store so why? Is the Singapore airline group taking their reputation and customer loyalty for granted? The meal I had was ok but my wife had a chicken dish that was terrible and I notice other passengers with the same dish largely left it. On arrival in Singapore no one to drive the air-bridge. At the price these guys charge compared to say Vietnam Air on the same route with similar equipment meals and service oh and headphones I know which one I will be on next trip.",False,,,Business Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,
SilkAir customer review,10,2014-07-27,That's how to do it. I just flew two short sectors SIN-PEN and PEN-SIN. I had something to eat and drink in 20 minutes. I flew on the same trip on EK and the same took 3 hours.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
SilkAir customer review,8,2014-07-17,SIN-BDO on A319-100. Old aircraft but superb service. Identifiable that SilkAir is a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines.

SilkAir customer review,7,2014-07-03,Singapore to Yogyakarta via Silkair return 20-24 Jun 14. Both flights quite full seat comfortable with more legroom than budget airline. Long queue at Yogyakarta airport Check-in. We received complimentary bottle of mineral water from the Silkair ground service manager. Cabin service was smiley and efficient. Meals edible but very small portions compared to SIA portion.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,True,
SilkAir customer review,8,2014-06-25,Singapore to Yogyakarta and Singapore to Kalibo return. Both flights on A320. Flight Yogyakarta was delayed on landing due to congestion in the airport-not really the airline's fault. Served hotcakes for breakfast which was nice. Flight back to Singapore was delayed because of the late arrival in Yogyakarta (again airport congestion) but cabin crew were very nice and professional with a semi-full load. Business class line in Yogyakarta was also used for economy which meant long wait for all passengers. Flight to Kalibo took off on time. Full load but cabin crew were warm and friendly. Flight back to Singapore was delayed because of delayed arrival of aircraft from Cebu. Meal was delicious and again friendly cabin crew. Check in was chaotic because of the small airport size with 4 international flights checking in at the same time and the different queues intersecting each other. However Silkair was the only one with clear and audible announcements in the airport and the staff tried their best in the chaotic check-in even though the space constraints limited what they could do.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,3,2014-06-13,Flew with SilkAir recently from SG to Penang on 7 June and back on 9 June. It was my first time flying with them and I was very disappointed. Really bad experience. Firstly the flight on the 7th was delayed for an hour and no announcements were being made leaving me and my family very puzzled. Next there was a lack in variety for the in-flight meals. The chicken pie served on the return flight was terrible as there was a burnt taste. Drinks wise they only serve water orange juice and tea. The last point was on the flight attendants. As the regional wing of Singapore Airlines I was utterly surprised at their dressing. They looked so sloppy in their uniforms with unkempt hair. However they still portrayed excellent service qualities such as being polite and attentive to address customers' needs.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,False,
SilkAir customer review,8,2014-05-18,SIN-REP return. Enjoyed my flight with Silkair to Siem Reap a couple of weeks ago. Cabin Crew were very friendly and cheerful. On both legs they seemed a lot more engaging than your usual cabin crew on other airlines. Breakfast onboard was pretty good with rounds of coffee and water following. Shame that the wireless streaming IFE had not already been implemented. Departure and arrival were both a little late but not a big deal. Disembarkation at Siem Reap via stairs which for some strange reason I really like. Bags were out fast.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,7,2014-05-17,Singapore to Lombok a very enjoyable flight. IFE was very limited just a rather farcical comedy show. The breakfast they served was excellent as was the service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,7,2014-05-17,Singapore to Penang. A pleasant flight with courteous service. The meal was a bit paltry even for such a short flight. Just a small tuna sandwich.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,3,,True,
SilkAir customer review,8,2014-03-31,Travelled SIN-HKT-SIN on 28/31 March. Both flights boarded quickly and departed/arrived on time. Service is good with fair enough seat pitch for a regional airlines. Food was the usual airlines fare with a main fruits and drinks. For the price though there is nothing to complain about. Plane was clean and I got to try their new 737 SIN-HKT.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,5,2014-03-17,MI 654 on SIN to HAN on March 11th. Pros: flight was on time food was okay. Service was good. Some choice of magazines. Cons: no personal in-flight entertainment only on overhead monitor w/o tune. I use my own airline headphones but tune was off so we could not hear anything.

SilkAir customer review,10,2014-03-03,Economy class from Singapore to Surabaya on Feb 28. Silk Air operates A319 on this sector. We got a front row seats as we traveled with one child and one infant. The flight attendants were very helpful and friendly. One of them even helped us by carrying our two hand luggage and stored them in the overhead compartment. During the meal time my wife decided to skip the meal service but a purser approached her and offered some bread - she had our daughter on her lap. I would say Silk Air in-flight services were better than SQ.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,
SilkAir customer review,8,2014-03-03,SIN - Koh Samui - SIN.

SilkAir customer review,9,2014-02-27,Flights from Singapore to Penang on 16th February return sector to Changhi on 26th February. Smooth flights both ways with attentive cabin crew and informative flight crew. For such a short flight approximately an hour each way drink and sandwich served. Only criticism was the lack of sandwich choice tuna on first leg sardines on the return. An alternative would have scored maximum choice. Flights all on time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,5,,True,
SilkAir customer review,7,2014-02-24,SIN-SBY-SIN on 30 January and 1 February. The SIN-SBY leg was okay - cabin crew forgot about my son when distributing children meals and only remembered when they saw him at the general meal service. One stewardess blurted out that they missed out a child another hushed her though I had already heard it. The service on the return leg was much better. Food was good though the portion size was rather small even for my 8-year-old. Seat pitch is comfortable with reasonable leg space. Would have rated them better if not for the lapse in service on the outbound flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,10,2014-01-08,SIN-DVO-SIN. This is a gem of an airline I have used this service to Davao on many occasions and always been extremely impressed with the staff food and aircraft comfort. When you consider that this is the only direct service into Davao from outside the Philippines it represents great value for money when compared to having to transit either Manila or Cebu.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,5,,True,
SilkAir customer review,9,2013-12-29,"SIN-KCH. The plane was a full one but the SilkAir crew handled the crowd professionally. The four lovely air stewardesses greeted and smiled all the time which resonates with the company's latest campaign ""Feeling Home Onboard"". The only downsides are: The crew should speak better English and when the leading air stewardess made any announcement she should needed to be a little louder. Other than that a simple pleasant short flight which I enjoyed.",False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True,
SilkAir customer review,7,2013-12-12,I flew SIN-CJB-SIN in Economy Class on November 17th and 29th. I have flown on this route twice before (in 2009 and 2011) but the flights had since been retimed to be more convenient. Both flights were close to 100% full. The aircraft were two very new A320-233s (9V-SLR and -SLQ respectively) and each flight took just over four hours. The Economy Class seats were fairly comfortable with adequate lumbar support and average pitch and legroom. Seat recline was limited though. One of my biggest gripes about flying with SilkAir is the lack of in-seat screens which many other airlines in the region and worldwide have fitted in their narrowbody Economy Class cabins. In- flight entertainment was the Silkwinds magazine (a fairly interesting read) and overhead screens showing silent films which in my opinion is insufficient for any flight of over two hours in duration. Drinks and a packet of nuts were offered a few times during the ascent cruise and descent and at mealtimes. The meals (lacto-ovo vegetarian in my case) were satisfactory though not as good both in terms of quality and quantity as the meals served onboard parent company Singapore Airlines' shorter flights. It is worth noting however that all service was conducted very courteously and to very high standards. Also worth noting is SilkAir's new 30 kg checked baggage allowance which I found very useful. All in all for the price paid (S$641.80 round-trip per adult) SilkAir offered fair value for money - though I hope to see an improved onboard product with the arrival of the airline's first B737-800s next year.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,True,
SilkAir customer review,7,2013-12-09,Flew SilkAir from Singapore to Kathmandu and back. It was an A320 with very generous legroom in its economy class. The service was solid the meals were OK (although the meal out of Kathmandu was less good than the one out of Singapore) and although there is no in-seat IFE system time flew by quite quickly. Nothing extraordinary but good enough!,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,True,
SilkAir customer review,8,2013-11-21,Hanoi to Singapore - excellent service - polite and attentive.

SilkAir customer review,9,2013-09-24,Have flown with Silk Air many times on the SIN-PNH route but have not wrote a review before. The service has always been good and plenty of leg room. The food and drinks are just right for this short 1hr 45min flight. The return to SIN this time was hampered by bad weather and we were delayed 15min landing but the pilot managed to keep clear of the worst and kept us informed. There is no in flight entertainment as such but I'm aware of this and have my ipod and book. Will fly Silk Air again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,10,2013-09-08,Return flights from SIN to Penang in early September travelling as a couple with two kids under 2. Just like it's big brother SQ Silkair maintained it's excellent approach to customer service. Attendants were patient and accommodating in helping with our two little ones offering toys and baby food as well as blocking a seat next to us. On the return flight I left a carry on bag on board and didn't realise until we had reached LHR! By the time I was able to access email there was already a message from the airline saying they had the bag at Changi and asked how they could get it back to me. I asked if it could be forwarded to Munich the next step on our itinerary and they have arranged it. Outstanding.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,True,

SilkAir customer review,2,2013-07-30,Thu 25 July 2013 I flew (MI 221) from Surabay to Singapore. During the meal service it was surprising that they just passed me by without offering anything. All passengers in front behind and next to me got offered the meal. They were 2 trolleys with 4 stewardess.

SilkAir customer review,6,2013-07-24,SIN-CEB return flight on SilkAir flight was punctual. Seating was good but food service was somewhat disappointing. Entertainment is provided on shared drop down screens but no sound! You watch programming in silence. Silkair is claiming to be best regional airline but service provided is only on par with other budget carriers such as Cebu Pacific. Cost of flights are vastly greater than the other low cost carriers who offer comparable service and only becomes a viable choice when used as an add on flight to Singapore Airways flights.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,False,
SilkAir customer review,9,2013-07-17,Singapore-Chiang Mai-Singapore as part of a Singapore Airlines codeshare ticket. Flight to Chiang Mai was a little late departing but flight back to Singapore departed on time. Both aircraft very clean and well presented.

SilkAir customer review,5,2013-03-25,SIN-PEN on A320. Did online check-in and selected my preferred seat but only learned from the check-in counter staff that my seat got changed because 'Silkair changed the aircraft type'. All I know is Silkair only flies on A310/320 since when it has different aircraft type other than the single aisle aircraft? Anyway I was in a hurry never argue with the staff. On time departure no IFE as expected. Basic snack with only coffee tea or orange juice OK for 1 hr 10 mins flight.

SilkAir customer review,1,2013-03-09,Kathmandu to Singapore I felt harassed in the check-in counter. They weighed my cabin bag twice.

SilkAir customer review,7,2013-03-06,SIN-HKT. The service was adequate. The cabin crew were young and had a poor level of English. We were served a hot dish and there were TV screens.

SilkAir customer review,7,2013-02-18,Flew Silk Air on the return trip from CCU-SIN. It was cheaper by 150 SGD compared to Singapore Airlines. For 150$ less there was no personal inflight entertainment. I guess for a night flight of 4 hours if you plan to sleep it is $150 worth saving. Return flight during the winter in the northern hemisphere is moved forward by an hour which meant it reached Singapore at 4.30 am which was too early. During summer it arrives at 5.30 am and I can catch a taxi at 6am without paying taxi surcharge. I have no major complaints and would recommend Silk Air as long as it is cheaper than Singapore Airlines.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,2,2013-02-06,Flight from Coimbatore to Singapore. While inflight service is fair ground staff were rude and arrogant. Staff at check-in counter refused to allow my laptop bag since I already had a handbag. Then the manager/supervisor came and I explained to him and then they allowed it after weighing and checking my laptop bag.

Actually quite impressed with the level of service offered and the professionalism of the crew. The meal/snack was of a great quality. The planes were new looking and seats were more than adequate remembering I am 6ft3 and 120kg I felt easily accommodated. Check in process quick and easy however was surprised that the check in at HKT only opened 1hr 50min before the flight departure time - I do not think this is normal maybe a staffing issue that day.

SilkAir customer review,8,2013-01-08,Flew Singapore-Davao-Singapore with return leg via Cebu. Check-in was quick both in Singapore and Davao flights on time and service was great with Captain informing passengers of flight path. Entertainment ok for a short flight but can be better. Food was excellent to Davao but tasteless going back to Singapore. SilkAir should improve managing their lines for transiting passengers in Cebu as travellers were cutting in the lines to the boarding lounge and the airline should put up signs for transiting passengers as some followed those disembarking in Cebu. Cosy and warm atmosphere despite being a full flight. Will fly SilkAir again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,True,

SilkAir customer review,2,2012-12-13,Booked over 6 months in advance for our tickets from Singapore to Koh Samui. This was the first flight with Silk Air and possibly the last. Food was very ordinary on the flight to Samui. We didn't eat it. Flight was okay apart from that but return flight was very poor. Despite booking together and being husband and wife we were placed in separate seats to make matters worse at the rear near the toilets. Admittedly it was a busy flight but the staff didn't seem to care. 'It's only a 1.5 hour flight' was the response when I asked if we could move to seats together. The food was better than on the way over but we felt like we were travelling with a very average budget airline even though we paid a premium price.

SilkAir customer review,4,2012-11-07,My most recent flight from KCH-SIN was very disappointing. I was seated at the second last row and one passenger assigned on the last row could not take her seat because it was wet. Flight was very full but luckily the flight attendants managed to find another seat for her but this had left the passenger and those around with a bad impression. Food was really bad (just a small curry puff) and limited choice of drinks. Additionally being seated on the second last row the thing I felt would have irritated many passengers was seeing flight attendants constantly opening the overhead compartment just to keep getting their handbags.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,3,,False,

SilkAir customer review,10,2012-09-24,Singapore to Kochi on airbus 320. I had transferred from an 18 and a half hour flight from JFK to Frankfurt to Singapore on Singapore Airlines. The Cabin Crew and the Flight Attendants did a very good job in getting us a bassinet seat for our one year old daughter. The food was great the seats were OK and the entertainment/shows were just reruns because of the flip down screens every 3 seats behind.

SilkAir customer review,10,2012-08-08,SIN-CEB on A320. Transfered from a 22-hour flight (JFK-FRA-SIN) with SQ to MI. Boarding was probably one of the most organized affairs I've dealt with. Flight attendants were efficient and friendly. Cabin was still the old-style with the blue seats. However they were very comfortable with proper lumbar support and legroom I felt was more than SQ's A380 in Y. The lack of personal IFE didn't bother me as it was only a 3.5-hour flight. There were screens on the over head that played various TV shows. Although they didn't have any headphones nor the seats had any ability to be plugged in with. Food was delicious and FAs were marching down the aisles with drinks every 10 minutes or so and it was only a 3 hour flight! Overall I would say it was a perfect experience on a regional carrier and I wish that US airlines would follow MI but I think we all know that won't happen.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,10,2012-07-19,MI 487/488 Calcutta to Singapore and return on 12 and 16 July 2012. First time on Silk Air i was impressed by the service especially that of the cabin crew. The row just behind me were drunk and demanding - asking for food and alcoholic beverages multiple times. They smilingly obliged to each of their demands. Food was good and sufficient with 2 rounds of drinks on both flights. Pilots gave information about the flight status and route three times during the flights. No personal entertainment system but reruns of bloopers wash out etc. Would fly again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,7,2012-07-09,"SIN-HKT-SIN. Both flights were serviced by a A320. The interior on both planes were old and scuffed. The seats were ok but not overly comfortable. Cabin temperature on the outbound flight was too cold. There was no personal inflight entertainment system though an overhead entertainment system played the same episode of the same show on both flights. Complimentary meals and drinks provided on both flights though the quality of the food and range was slightly worse than that on Singapore Airlines. Even though my return flight was a morning flight Silk Air decided to serve a curry where a breakfast meal would have been more appropriate. Outbound flight was full of Australians yelling at the top of their voices and walking to the front of the plane in an attempt to be the first to order a ""cold one"". The crew worked well under these difficult conditions. The service is very good. Nevertheless the flight attendants remained composed managed disrespectful passengers well and always kept a smile on their face.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,1,2012-05-03,Got a flight from Siem Reap to Katmandu in one booking although there was an 18 hour transit in Singapore they did not provide hotel nor informed us about the situation so we could plan and book accommodation earlier. All transit hotels were full so we had to stay in nap areas of the airport all night. Never again flying with Silk.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
SilkAir customer review,9,2012-04-09,Singapore-Cebu. Very good service nice friendly flight attendants. No delays at all - nice clean plane (A320) one meal which was nice often came round with drinks and snacks. Overall great service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,8,2012-03-27,PEN-SIN in Business Class. Check-in quick and due to lack of lounge you get a voucher which can be used in Coffee Bean and McDonalds. Boarding on time and staff very friendly and pleasant addressed all Business Class passengers by name. Meal served was very nice and tea offered afterwards. Arrival on time but priority baggage did not arrive first which was disappointing.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,7,2012-03-22,SIN-CJB-SIN on A319. Aircraft full but in good condition. Outbound to CJB - a delay of 45 mins but return on time. IFE was virtually non existent; only a few silent features played over and over on drop-down screens. The meal was the same both ways edible on the way in served at cabin temperature on the return to SIN. Crew very professional and pleasant. In short a fairly good flight but for the amount we paid for the tickets ($800+ per person) SilkAir did not offer good value for money.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
SilkAir customer review,9,2012-03-14,SIN-HKT-SIN. Short flight to Phuket and back. Full service where crew begins with an offering of two kinds of newspapers! No IFE but hardly matters. Meals offered with a choice of meats. Drinks offered twice during the flight. Great seats with ample leg room. All in all a very good regional product offering great value for money.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,8,2012-02-28,SUB-SIN. On time. Choices of meal was rice with beef or noodles with chicken. For both choices there was an additional small cake and a cup of sealed water. Furthermore you had own choice of whatever you wanted to drink. A320 used on this flight is much better than the A319. You have a full day in Surabaya then board and arrive in Changi 2 hours before many of the European flights leave. That leaves you enough time to enjoy Changi airport at bit with no rush to catch your plane.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,7,2012-02-25,SIN-SUB. Departed 10 minutes early. A319 is starting to get a bit old. Seats look very used. Food was good but not excellent. I would recommend since this fits perfectly with the European flight arriving in the morning in Singapore so you have around 2 hours layover in Changi before landing at 9.10am local Surabaya time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,7,2012-01-17,SIN-CNX. Efficient service. It was only a 3hr flight so only one meal (which wasn't great) but we were given plenty of water and juice. Plane was an A320 so small seats not too much bother on short flights though. Good overall service friendly and helpful staff. Not much of inflight entertainment though and no headphones to watch one of the screens.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,6,2011-12-29,SIN-DAD on Airbus A320. Plane departed and arrived on time. Service onboard excellent directly after take off drinks were served and crew made several rounds during the flight. Food a big disappointment - a tasteless chicken curry and no salt and pepper in the cutlery bag. In terms of seating just like any other standard airline. Price was low and got me to my destination safely so will use them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,7,2011-11-29,Singapore to Kathmandu return. Seats reasonably comfortable. Service and food were good. Return flight was much better although was late leaving making it a rush to connect to our flight from Changi. Overall a good experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,10,2011-11-28,Chennai-Singapore Business Class A319. Despite the small aircraft operating this route the business class cabin was comfortable and the service was excellent. The flight leaves at a great time and I prefer this to the usual midnight flights. Food was more to the Asian palate and spicy but good. Would like to see a better quality Western option. Excellent inflight drinks and snacks and great service.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,10,2011-08-23,Surprised at the comfort of the plane and professional staff. On such a short flight Singapore-KL I wasn't expecting much however the cabin was clean new and nicely fitted out. Leg room was fine and staff were attentive. I was happy to be flying a 737 rather than something smaller.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,10,2011-08-22,Cabin crew were helpful and friendly. Offered drinks constantly and gave my 6 year old games to keep her entertained. We were 4 passengers from Singapore to Lombok and were all happy with their services.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,7,2011-08-22,Singapore-Kochi on A320. Cabin crew professional seating comfortable. Cabin was clean and well maintained. No shortage of pillows and blankets making for a pleasant 4 hr night flight. Luggage delivered promptly at Kochi.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,10,2011-08-05,AMI-SIN. Very impressed by this short haul flight. Very food crew. Staff were efficient from check-in at the smallish Lombok airport and throughout the flight. Plane was A320 clean and airy. Very good fish for dinner. Arrival in SIN 30 mins before scheduled time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,10,2011-07-31,KCH-SIN A short and pleasant flight. Despite the crowded plane the cabin crew is still warm and friendly. SilkAir has finally launched new menus which makes frequent traveler more appertising. The ground staff is friendly and extends warm welcome to everyone. Also SilkAir has also introduced the new autumn theme seating. Simple soothing yet truly makes passengers feel exclusive. SilkAir also departs and arrives on time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,8,2011-06-15,Chiang-Mai to Singapore flight was on time cabin crew were nice and friendly. Plane was in good condition food average inflight entertainment was good. Overall a good short flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,9,2011-06-08,SIN-MES-SIN. Excellent service both ways. Staff courteous and efficient - surprised to be addressed by name by cabin crew. Never got this treatment from the crew on my SQ SIN-CGK-SIN flight the following day.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,4,2011-06-06,SIN-PEN-SIN chose Silkair because it offered good departure and arrival times for a weekend trip. Legroom was okay and departure / arrival via Changi Terminal 2 is better than via the Budget Terminal. However there was no inflight entertainment snacks were of poor quality and the aircraft wasn't looking too new either. On this 1 hour 20 minute flight if you're not a connecting passenger from an SQ flight there isn't really that much to differentiate Silkair from the other airlines that fly this route such as MH AK 3K and TR.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
SilkAir customer review,8,2011-04-14,SNE-HKT return. Outbound flight left 20 minutes late very full plane. I was carrying a large garment bag containing my wedding dress and crew happily hung it in wardrobe for me. Decent refreshment served even though only a 1 hr 20 minute flight special meal and my partner normal meal and both were quite good. Seats ok - cabin is 3x3 config. Cabin looking a little old and tired but fine for a regional flight. Only inflight entertainment is on overhead screens. Newspapers supplied on inbound flight again another refreshment which was fine. Both directions the cabin was very hot and stuffy which got a bit uncomfy. Crew efficient and fine to deal with.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,9,2011-01-26,Kuching-Singapore returng. The ground staff in Kuching and in Singapore are friendly and helpful. Cabin crew friendly and shows great hospitality. The only thing I would like to comment is that SilkAir should make new safety videos and also provide different kind of inflight meals. In general it is an airline worth recommending to everyone!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,10,2011-01-11,A320 economy service SIN-LGK was very satisfactory. Both legs on time check in completed expeditiously seat pitch better than SIA A380 economy. In flight food adequate for 90 min short haul flight served by well turned out and attentive cabin staff.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,10,2010-12-18,SIN-PEN. Excellent flight comfortable seats on A320. Friendly and efficient cabin crew. Hot snack and drink provided on this short flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,10,2010-12-13,Singapore-Phuket on A320. Seat fine and clean. Cabin staff very friendly and professional. Special Meal was served as requested drinks very good and served twice. Overall very satisfied with everything and will choose them again as first airline option. Baggage was very fast on belt at Phuket.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,7,2010-11-26,Singapore-Da Nang via Siem Reap. Passengers from Siem Reap to Singapore join on outbound journey and stay on board at Da Nang for direct flight to Singapore. Silkair okay for a regional short haul airline. Business class resembles premium economy which is okay in a flight lasting only just over 3 hours same for food. Wine served from small 2 glass bottles which are on most airlines dished out to passengers rather than eked out. Cabin crew charming and thoughtful - a colleague who is a vegetarian hadn't ordered veggie food but stewardess offered him economy fish meal as alternative and promised to put in a request for veggie meal on his return to Singapore. Da Nang airport has no provision for business class lounge whereas at Changi T2 the Silkair lounge is a shared one - not a terrific place to spend 6 hours in transit. Silkair office in Da Nang very uncooperative not to say obstructive requiring direct communication with Singapore HQ which resulted in action.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,8,2010-11-22,Coimbatore-Singapore in Business Class. A nice flight partly I suspect because I happened to be the only passenger in the small business class cabin on the A319. As the flight departed at 1245am it was good to get the supper meal served and out of the way so to get some sleep. I would rate Silk Air Business Class equivalent to a good premium economy but still quite satisfying. The wine was good FAs were charming. While check-in was handled professionally boarding was chaotic at Coimbatore maybe as there do not appear to be many international flights in and out of this small airport and associated terminal suggesting need for more practice in dealing with such flights.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,8,2010-11-18,SIN-REP return both legs with stop in Danang makes journey longer and less convenient. IFE not impressive enough only small screens every 4 rows and I spent my time reading instead. Food and beverages are average. Since I got promo fare it is a good deal compared to JetStar.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,7,2010-11-03,Yangon-Singapore return. An unexceptional flight. Service was fine but not outstanding. For a flight which was just under 3 hours I thought they could offer a few extras - such as coming through with drinks before dinner and having a more substantial entertainment offering. The meals were very tasteless and the trays don't even come with salt and pepper. Singapore Airlines which flies the slightly shorter Bangkok-Singapore route offers all of these.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
SilkAir customer review,1,2010-10-14,"SIN-KTM Business class A320. Spacious seats nice cabin attentive crew addressing each passenger by name throughout the flight. Flight deteriorated after meal service when the crew allowed the members of several tour groups travelling in economy to come and sit with their friends in Business serving them drinks and snacks subjecting business passengers to a four hour procession of childish mock resentful comments such as ""so this is how the other half live"". When all the seats were full people then stood in the aisles at one stage there were 15 people in a 12 seat cabin. They were only asked to return to their seats on commencement of descent into KTM. Noisy intrusive and unpleasant. A complaint about the noise to the Chief Purser resulted only in a mute fixed smile. No other airline would allow this. Never again under any circumstances in a premium cabin with SilkAir.",False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
SilkAir customer review,8,2010-09-13,SIN-HKT-SIN in economy although more expensive compared to the competition on this route Silkair have the best schedule. Service is much better decent food one way was a nice new A320. I was surprised to get free alcoholic drinks on this short flight. Check in and boarding all good except please enforce the one-piece-of-handluggage-policy. Some people have a trolley and three big plastic bags per person! Arrival in HKT was great was in the cab 25 minutes after touchdown even after waiting 5 minutes for my bag.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,10,2010-09-10,Singapore-Kota Kinabalu return economy class. Very pleasant and punctual flights with decent meals extremely helpful flight attendants and a cheerful cabin. The service was exceptionally good for a short two-hour flight. I actually felt like an appreciated customer on this airline! Unfortunately this is not the norm these days but it should be..,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,9,2010-08-30,SIN-PEN-SIN economy. Flights on-time and service was very good. Food tasty for a 1 hour flight and better than carriers in Europe or US where you get nothing for flights this short. They hand out newspapers in different languages and blankets. T2 in SIN is good and efficient and online check-in easy to use. A very good regional carrier and puts other legacy carriers to shame.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,7,2010-08-26,KUL-SIN economy. Basically an SQ flight in colorful uniform. Short flight so no chance to try anything. Did have an issue with child seat belts. Requested one for a 2+ year old baby but the first FA refused. Second one consulted with purser then declined. Eventually spoke to the head and managed to convinced her to let us have one. Do get that problem on SQ flights.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,10,2010-08-13,SIN-BPN-SIN was great. Check in was quick even though I can't use online check in facility since my ticket was a promotion fare tix. Flights on time. Inflight service was good. BPN-SIN sector offered slightly better meal compared with SIN-BPN. The crew were great BPN-SIN while SIN-BPN were a little bit robotic but still provided a good service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,10,2010-07-18,Singapore - Phnom Penh round trip. An amazing regional airline with impressive service on the ground and in the air. I checked in online and obtaining the boarding passes and checking bags in both SIN and PNH was quick and efficient. Even though I have had a separate itinerary on Singapore Air to San Francisco the agent in PNH checked my bag all the way to SFO and provided me with boarding passes for SQ itinerary. A320 aircraft flight attendants were pleasant and professional. Shortly after take off there was a drink run with alcoholic beverages available at no charge followed by meal service - a choice of 2 entrees. No personal screens though - there were video screens in the cabin which is fine for a short flight like this.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,6,2010-05-11,Phuket - Singapore. Nice change from flying Jetstar up to Phuket. Comfortable seats decent legroom friendly warm crew. A light meal was served - not the best - dried out seafood noodles but OK for the short hop. Meal presentation should be updated - tired old electric blue meal tray! A319 that didn't have the new upgraded seats but was more comfortable than the cramped budget carriers. The inflight entertainment is truly odd. While Singapore Airlines the parent company prides itself on its excellent inflight entertainment it seems to somehow be quite comfortable with its regional partner showing lame silent programs on the video screens - why bother ? If you're going to have IFE do it properly.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
SilkAir customer review,8,2010-04-09,SIN-PEN-SIN. Check-in and Service very good. Food good and nice to get something on this short leg. FAs nice and more casual than on SIA. A small problem is that huge amounts of hand luggage are allowed into the cabin which means on the way to PEN the FAs were so busy with arranging hand luggage that they did not have the time the nice little extras like taking jacket away. On the way back one FA wanted to go the extra mile which was not much appreciated by her colleague but still all were professional and very friendly.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,10,2010-03-09,A short flight from Kuching to Singapore leaving mid morning. No lounge at KCH but business class passengers are given a voucher for a free drink and snack at the coffee outlet in the terminal Flight operated by an A319 which has just 8 business class seats which are configured 2x2. The seats are comfy and include an electronic leg and foot rest. Crew proficient and friendly. Choice of two hot meals - I had the lamb which was excellent and regular offers of wine and water. Arrival was on time and i left feeling I'd really enjoyed the experience which matches the high standards of SIA on thinner regional routes (Silk Air is the regional affiliate of SIA). An excellent airline judging by this flight.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,9,2010-02-16,KCH-SIN. The cabin crew were very helpful. It is a short trip but an enjoyable one. I would recommend SilkAir to passengers on KCH-SIN route as it's worth the money compared to other airlines (budget airlines excluded).,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,8,2010-01-23,KUL-SIN-KUL. Both flights on the A320. The cabin crew quite pleasant and leg space good for this short 40 minute flight. They only do a Beverage service on this flight. Choice of newspapers are handed out before take-off and its time to land before you are done with it. They have convenient timings on this route with 37 flights a week to allow for you to travel for Singapore or KL just for the day for meetings or otherwise. The interiors of the aircraft are maintained quite well but I would say not up to the SQ standards. The price of a round trip is competitive to Malaysia Airlines on this route but a bit higher than the LCC's.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,8,2009-12-12,Kuala Lumpur - Singapore a short flight but very enjoyable. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful but due to the full flight and short duration were rushed and forgetful of some passengers' request. Drinks served but in a small portion lavatories were not well stocked. Variety of drinks could also be improved. Free newspapers were offered. Overall it was enjoyable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SilkAir customer review,9,2009-11-29,Phuket to Singapore in November 2009 on SilkAir A319 aircraft one of my best flights in Economy Class. I felt everything was above average: the cabin the meals and serving generally. I liked the comfortable seat and the great crew.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
