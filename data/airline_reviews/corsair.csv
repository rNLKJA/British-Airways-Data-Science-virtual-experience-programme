Then half the plane did not get their luggage, and there were people connecting to Paris. No help from PTP staff either, they just showed us the number of lost luggage service on the wall and told us to call it. My bag is missing for three days now.

"""Corsair probably won't disappoint""",8,2020-03-15,"Not Verified |  Paris to Miami. I was skeptical about flying Corsair after reading very mixed and less-than-stellar reviews, however, I was pleasantly surprised. Our trip (I traveled with my adult daughter) took place during the second week of March 2020 and the Corona virus drama. Check-in at MIA was uneventful. Since it was not a sold-out flight, we each sat in a different row. OK, so the airplane had the look and feel of a discount airline: narrow, thinly padded vinyl-feeling seats, however, legroom was pretty decent and the movie selection wasn't terrible. Food was pretty bad in terms of quality and variety, but I paid $400 RT, so I won't complain. Flight left on time and got us there ahead of schedule, so perhaps my bar is set pretty low, but I was a happy camper. For the flight back from Paris to Miami, we were scheduled for Monday, March 16 2020 .. on Thursday morning I find out about the whole travelers ban, and all sorts of red lights start flashing. I try to call Corsair to move the flight up and their telephone system is terrible. Prior to to leaving Miami, I tried calling them to ask a couple of questions and all the calls were greeted with a pre-recorded message from a call-forwarding system. A day later, all I got was a message that seemed to be recorded by someone at home. That was a very off-putting experience. Similar situation when trying to call their Paris number: calls were repeatedly immediately disconnected. Until the receptionist at the hotel suggested I call the ""3917"" number (how is a tourist supposed to know that?) at like $0.40 per minute. I was finally able to speak to a representative, who very courteously listened to our situation, took my information, and promised to call me back to let me know what could be done. An hour later she called to let me know that our departure had been moved to Friday, March 13, so Corsair gets major points there! Check-in at Orly went without a hitch and since we were only like 60 passengers in an A330, we had room to spare. This was a different A330, fabric seats and 9 abreast instead of 8 (narrow!). I moved up to the Economy Plus section .. besides a little more legroom and the fact that they recline a little more fully, I cannot understand nor justify the price differential. The seats are the same width and just as thin as those in economy. Flight left about 45 minutes late due (we were told) to immigration issues with a passenger. Cabin crew was attentive, polite, even happily served me an extra couple of lunches when I asked mid-way through the flight (I was starving!), and had bottles of water, juices and soft drinks on the galley counter to serve yourself whenever you were thirsty. So no complaints there. Overall, we got our money's worth plus plus. If you're looking for something of the caliber of Lufthansa Premium Economy or Business, then you will not be satisfied, but if you're looking for an inexpensive flight that gets you where you need to go, the Corsair probably won't disappoint.",False,A330,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Miami,March 2020,2,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",5,5,,,True

Corsair customer review,,2006-12-17,Paris Orly to St Martin West Indies. Check-in staff disinterested. Aircraft an ageing 747 with very cramped seating and no inflight entertainment screens. Food was disgusting cabin crew impolite and inefficient. Thank God the aircraft which should have brought us back went unserviceable and after a four-hour wait without info two British aircraft including a 747 arrived to carry the passengers Corsair would have put into one! I have flown with most European charters and can unreservedly say Corsair is in a class of its own for low quality.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False

Corsair customer review,,2006-05-01,Paris ORY to La Romana (Dominican republic) Economy class going and business class for coming back. At the airport for the two flights check-in and boarding were quick and organized and there was no delay (rare for a charter airline). The plane was a new Boeing 747-400. Seats very cramped food disgusting but cabin crew professional and friendly. Coming back I was in business class which is located on the upper-deck : seats were comfortable with a personal screen food good and service nice. I think the business class of Corsair is not a business class like Air France British Airways or Singapore Airlines but better than Air India or Air Mauritius. Price was only 150 euros more for one flight.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False

Corsair customer review,,2006-03-15,Corsair A330-200 YUL-ORY / ORY-YUL. I didn't know what to expect from them as I had never taken any charter flight before. YUL-ORY. We took off 2 hours late because the aircraft arrived late from Paris. The flight was fine even though I was traumatized by how cramped the seats were. The crew was friendly and the food was good. ORY-YUL. Now that was a complete nightmare. We were supposed to takeoff at 11 am. We took of at 6 pm without any explanations. I had the emergency exit seat this time so the flight in itself was good. Will I ever fly again with them? only if I absolutely have too. I give them 4.5/5 out of 10.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False

Corsair customer review,,2005-02-27,We went from Paris to Pointe à Pitre/Guadeloupe. Let alone the very poor ORLY airport's service (information desk not occupied no signs nobody wants to help you finding the right terminal). On the plane: Seats very cramped food poor films uninteresting. But as the seating space in AF to Réunion to which we are accustomed is not a bit better we took it. Our (direct) flight back was cancelled and brought forward by 3 hours what we learned by chance (!) reading a note on the hotel's pinboard. The plane was very untidy when we got in. And it was not a direct flight; we had a stop- over of a full hour in Fort-de-France (we had to leave the plane and amused ourselves in the duty- free shop) but at least the plane was cleaned there. Result: We started two hours earlier than we had planned and came back to Paris one hour later and were almost too late for our sequel flight from CDG to Frankfurt. Fortunately there seems to be an understanding between AF and Corsair and so even before we landed we were informed that we need not worry: AF was already informed about our delay (thank you staff!) and was willing to book us on the next flight which was eventually not necessary because we got our luggage early and caught the bus by running. Well as we saved 400 EUR for two persons on that flight in comparison to AF and as we know know what we possibly would have to expect we would try Corsair once again.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False

Corsair customer review,,2005-01-22,"LAX-PPT not bad. The food was just as exceptional as AF but the FA's were much friendlier and more humorous very attentive to ones needs. And the fare US$590 cannot be beat. The 747 was interesting-looking; a giant set of red lips painted on the side with the word ""sex"" on the landing gear door. Only problems were that there were long departure delays and the seats while comfortable were very cramped together. If they still flew to Tahiti I'd definitely fly them again.",False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False

Corsair customer review,,2004-12-11,CRL on Paris to Fort-de-France and return and my worst flights so far. The flight from ORY was delayed of 9 hours without any explanations. Then we had to wait for two hours in the plane after boarding (which was a rush). Their 747-300 are fit with 580 seats (90 more than AF) that's are very cramp and old. I was lucky enough to get a seat in the upper-deck just after the biz class so I had a lot of legroom available but this was the only attract of this flight. The food was horrible and the crew was very rude and only seemed to be interested in getting their break. The way back was horrible (although our flight was not delayed) because of an old 747-200 with even more cramped seats and rude flight attendants (some have even kept their sunglasses during the flight!). I hope no foreigners use this carrier because it doesn't give a good look of France.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
