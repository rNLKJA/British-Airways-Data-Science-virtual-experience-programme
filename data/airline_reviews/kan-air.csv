"""they often cancel flights""",1,2016-11-07,"✅ Verified Review |  Chiang Mai to Hua Hin with Kan Air. After we checked in we have to wait long time. Then we entered bus to the plane. After a while bus stopped and returned to gate. After several minutes the announcement that flight is cancelled! We get no information and it was a big mass till we get an other flight to Bangkok Don Muang operated by Nok air. From Don Muang we get Minivan to Hua Hin. This was first and last time we booked this airline. If they are not able to give information, and we heard from other passengers that they often cancel flights, the airline will not survive! Everybody was happy to have some flight from Hua Hin to Chiang Mai. But such behavior will destroy the business.",False,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,CNX to HHQ,November 2016,2,3,,1,1,,False
"""small but very efficient airline""",10,2016-08-23,"✅ Verified Review |  Chiang Mai to Khon Kaen with Kan Air. A small but very efficient airline. ATR very clean, ground staff did a great job and the biggest surprise 2 options between fish and chicken meal with rice for a 50 minute flight with 2 rounds of drinks. I choose this airline as the fastest way to go from Korat (airport closed) to Chiang Mai via Khon Kaen to avoid a 5 hour bus ride. As for the price - this was half than a bus ticket to Chiang Mai. Excellent.",False,ATR72,Business,Economy Class,CMX to KKC,August 2016,5,5,,5,5,,True
