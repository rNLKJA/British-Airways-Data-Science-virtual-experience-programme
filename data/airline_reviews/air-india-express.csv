On showing my full vaccination certificate (Covishield from India with QR code), they claimed this is not the right certificate, since it only showed the date of second dose, not the first dose. (Isn't it obvious I have taken the first dose if second dose is valid?) Also, in my certificate printout, our PM Modi's picture was not printed clearly and they raised an issue stating 'where is Modi's picture? This is not authentic'. Does the airline really validate vaccination certificates based on Modi's photo rather than the valid QR code right next to it? When I tried to explain that I travelled to Doha 2 months earlier with the same certificate and had no issue, the staff told me not to argue and would not even bother listening to me. He demanded I show him the date of first dose or I cannot board the flight. Luckily, I had my laptop with me and I could access the first dose certificate in a couple of minutes.

"""entire cabin wasn't in good condition""",3,2017-12-17,"Check in was extremely chaotic at both Mumbai to Sharjah. I was only checked in 1hr before departure in spite of arriving 2.5 hrs early at BOM. Air India handles Air India express check in at BOM and they were not helpful at all, more like clueless on how to handle the check in. Was hoping to at least fly on one of the newer planes. Unfortunately, on both sectors (BOM-SHJ & return), I flew on the older ones. Bringing positives in view first: Cabin Crew on both flights surprisingly stood out. All 4 or them were helpful in every way. Always received a ""Your Welcome"" when I thanked them. Another plus was the small snack box, consisting of juice, few snacks & a water bottle. Tea and coffee service was also done with refills provided, which was really nice. The crew were more than willing to offer one more snack box if requested. The seat was alright. However, coming to the negatives, the entire cabin wasn't in good condition. It gave a very old feeling. The washrooms did not have any lighting inside and it was dark if you had to use it. Overall, I would not recommend to fly with this airline as, they need to improve all areas from start to end to better the passenger experience.

"""regret this decision forever""",4,2016-11-07,"✅ Verified Review |  We travelled on Ar India Express for the first time on the trip from Delhi to Dubai return in September this year. I will regret this decision forever. To start with, the airconditioning was not working when we boarded the plane. That made it difficult to sit even for 10 minutes inside the plane. We shuddered at the thought of spending the 3.5  hour flight sweating. Thankfully the airconditioning started once we were airborne and reached a satisfactory level in about half an hour. We were seated in the row just before the emergency exits. The pushback buttons had been crudely taken out of our seats to prevent us from pushing the seats back. There was an inflight audio entertainment system in each seat but was not functional. One could see broken edges of seat arms, window sealings etc. all over the plane. The inflight staff did not have a groomed look, the meals provided were just passable. It was the same story on the return flight. Taken a vow to never fly with Air India Express again.

Since I had connected flight from Chennai to Coimbatore at 6.30 on 4th Feb, I requested for assistance of staff in Kuala Lumpur - they took my data of connecting flights and promised me that alternative connecting flights will be arranged and informed to Officials in Chennai. But flight took only at 5 am on 4th Feb and it landed at 6.30 am in Chennai airport. My connecting flight had already departed the airport.

The cost was not actually that much lower than the other airlines. The seats were a dingy red leather. Although the staff appeared to be attentive, they did not look enthused at all. On landing at Abu Dhabi, some passengers decided to get up from their seat before the plane had reached a complete stop.

Air India Express customer review,3,2015-07-24,"Took this flight because of convenient timing. Check in was smooth. Surprisingly they started boarding early, more than 1 hour before flight time. Plane was only 3 minutes from the terminal. We got to the plane and thee was no AC, temperature outside was over 40 degrees Celsius (Dubai in July). Passengers were getting very restless and children were crying due to heat. They had us on the plane for a very long time and we ended up leaving late, so more than 1 hour on the plane. AC only went on properly 15 minutes after take off. The aircraft was very very old and dirty. Flight was smooth and crew was friendly. They need to use newer planes, or reconsider.

They provided snacks and even I got 3 bottles of water extra upon request. On the return the flight was almost full. Good service on time departure on both segments.

Air India Express customer review,8,2015-02-11,This is a summary of several flights I have taken on AIX on the Dubai-Pune-Dubai route. These flights were at a very convenient time during the day. Now they have been shifted to the early hours of the morning which makes it less convenient though still better than driving BOM-PNQ-BOM. All the flights I have taken so far have been smooth and excellent - take-offs landings and en route. Service is generally excellent and they surprisingly serve a small snack with unlimited water. I have invariably requested and obtained emergency exit seats with ample legroom. Toilets are clean again surprisingly but smell a bit. The main thing that needs to be improved is the maintenance of the cabin. The carpets are worn and the leather seats need refurbishing. The interior of these 738 aircraft need a good scrubbing. But other than that AIX does well on this route.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,,,5,,True,
Air India Express customer review,3,2015-01-14,Flew from Dubai to Lucknow and back to Dubai. The crew seemed bored and the service was horrible. The table was broken and the meal served was inedible.

Air India Express customer review,1,2014-10-12,Apart from having point to point connection there is nothing else that this airline can offer. I flew from Dubai to Amritsar and back and found this trip rather exhausting and uncomfortable due to the airline service. Being a budget carrier does mean to save costs but its doesn't mean to keep your aircraft's dirty and unhygienic. When I entered the aircraft both the times I felt as I am traveling in one of those public buses which are disposed for public use (to be honest even public buses are well maintained that Air India Express aircraft's) the crew looked angry for no reason it felt as if they were punished to come here and serve us they did not have the decency to speak politely with passengers and just dumped their frustration on us. Food was awful as everything looked stale and had no taste.

Air India Express customer review,1,2014-03-25,Booked Dubai-Pune-Dubai in Jan 2014 however had to change the Dubai-Pune leg of the journey. My return journey (Pune-Dubai) was a nightmare. On arriving at the airport in the early hours of the morning I realized that my flight had been delayed for reasons unknown/unannounced to me. Then delayed 40 minutes in the security check line because other domestic flights need to be released earlier. After much delay I arrive at the final gate only to see no information displayed about my flight. Its delayed further. No one at any counter to enquire for any information. Felt relieved when the announcement to board was being made but there was more to come we were made to sit inside the aircraft as the pilots did not have clearance from ATC. It turned out to be for an hour or more until we finally were given clearance to fly.

Air India Express customer review,7,2014-02-17,Flew Pune to Dubai and back. Flight was on time in both legs. Seat quality could have been improved.

Air India Express customer review,8,2014-01-23,Traveled SHJ-COK-SHJ last month. I have selected this flight because the holiday season started and IX was the cheapest available from UAE to Kochi. After my disastrous trip by Air India last month on the same sector I was not expecting much from IX but I should admit that I was surprised. Nice and clean aircraft with enough legroom polite cabin crew who were attending the passengers with a smile and on time take off and landing was part of the surprise package.

Air India Express customer review,6,2013-08-26,"DXB-PNQ-DXB. Check in was smooth at DXB T2 and I managed to get 1C. The plane from the inside looked a bit shabby as most AI aircraft somehow do but I was happy for the extra legroom for my 6'3"" frame. A very overweight couple took seats 1A and B after smiling sheepishly at me. The man was overflowing into my seat. I saw that 1D was empty and moved over. AIX served a flimsy cardboard box containing a sandwich a small packet of banana chips something fried and inedible and a muffin. Strange assortment but better than nothing and welcome on a low cost carrier. Unlimited water as well. Drinks are chargeable. Flight left about 30 minutes late but arriving into PNQ was a breeze and I was home in 10 minutes after leaving the airport. Check-in in PNQ for the return leg was chaotic as usual and the woman insisted my bags were overweight. I smiled a lot and finally after I removed my laptop from my hand luggage she let me go through and even gave me a reclining exit row seat. The seat bottom was worn out and the metal bar kept poking my rear. When I asked for a blanket (even a used blanket) I was told they had run out of them. I avoided serious long term damage to my tailbone by moving and shifting through the flight. Same food was served on this leg. Overall it was good value for money.

Air India Express customer review,4,2009-08-07,DXB-IXE. Boarded with apprehension but quite pleasantly surprised. Reasonably clean aircraft pleasant crew and food!

Air India Express customer review,3,2008-12-27,I am regular passenger in UAE-Kerala route. Flights seems to be fairly reasonable compared to the fare structure and clean. Crew helpful. But the snacks to be supplied as per the timing. On mid night flights supplying banana chips and cakes really upset the stomach. Any toasted bread sandwiches (veg or non-veg) would be more ideal which will not add up the cost to the airlines. The fare calculation methods seems strange. Sometimes a person buying an online ticket far earlier before 1 or two months pays more than someone take it on the day or previous day of the flight. Also the taxes calculation. More basic fare is with less tax and vice versa. Recently the cancellation charges have been increased to 35% which is really unbearable. It should be reversed to 10% before 10 days and 15% prior to 24 hrs at least.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air India Express customer review,4,2008-10-23,Singapore to Calcutta return. An adequate performance from this budget carrier. The flights were on time the comfort was adequate and the staff generally reasonably friendly. The only slight downside was the quality of food offered in the snackbox - barely edible pastries and deep fried cookies. However the flight is only about 4 hours so having little to eat wasn't a big problem. The tickets were 50% cheaper than the only other carrier to offer non-stop flights on this route (Singapore Air) so overall I was extremely pleased with Air India Express.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air India Express customer review,3,2007-12-27,TRZ to KUL via Chennai return. The aircraft was relatively clean on both sectors. Since this was the only flight to Trichy from Kuala Lumpur I thought it would be more practical to just take this flight since there is no hassle of getting out into Chennai. However the transit procedure in Chennai is terrible. We had to get on bus queue up till everyone got off the plane and go though security check again. For the price you pay the service is not at all worthwhile.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air India Express customer review,4,2007-11-27,I paid INR 13000 on IX flight from Kolkata to Singapore compared to about 21000 in SQ. The aircraft was clean crew reasonably friendly.

Air India Express customer review,,2006-05-05,My third flight on IX (from Dubai to Cochin) and quite possibly my last. It appears that there is no cabin maintenance at all. Most seat cushions badly soiled - as if the plane had been used to carry livestock. No paper or cloth covers for the head rests. Carpet in a filthy and lamentable state throughout the cabin. At first I thought the window I was sitting next to was covered in a layer of condensation. I then found out it was a film of grease and grime with the window frame covered in a brownish substance containing lots of human hair.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air India Express customer review,,2005-11-30,Air India Express from Cochin to Dubai on 25/11/05. Aircraft quite new and thanks to being seated in one of two emergency exit rows lots of leg room. Despite travelling on a low cost airline you nevertheless are served a snack consisting of sandwich cake fruit juice water coffee or tea. On the downside the passenger next to me was allowed boarding in a clearly less than sober state and the crew continued to serve him hard liquor throughout the flight (alcoholic beverages available on a for sale basis). He even managed to complete the entire flight without ever having availed of the seat belt. Also despite being a non-smoking flight crew were quite relaxed at seeing the lavatories being used continuously as smoking rooms - with the obvious and objectionable result of extremely bad air quality in the cabin throughout the flight.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
