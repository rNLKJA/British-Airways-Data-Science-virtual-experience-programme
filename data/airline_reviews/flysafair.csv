"""worst customer service""",1,2018-10-04,"Johannesburg to Port Elizabeth. On 21/09/2018 I had one of the worst customer service experiences with Safair at OR Thambo International Airport. Not only were their staff inexperienced and incompetent but they were extremely rude and unhelpful with a situation where I was innocent. I missed my flight out of Johannesburg to Port Elizabeth, flight FA360, departing at 18:20. A few factors contributed to this flight being missed and are as follows: Delays and Cancellations at ORT: Most of the flights posted on the flight screens were either delayed or cancelled on Friday evening. The assumption was that due to the public holiday, the airport was facing congestion. Flights that were meant to depart at 15:15, 15:25, 16:00 etc were showing as either 'Boarding', 'Departing', 'Cancelled' or 'Delayed' at +- 18:00 2. Flight Screens: The flight screens at ORT were clearly out of order (as per the above point) and so flights that may have looked to be 'delayed' were in fact departing and flights that were ‘cancelled’ may have in fact been 'departing'. This was confirmed by Safair team members at the departure gate for flight FA360. Gate Change: The flight screens at ORT had flight FA360 departing from gate E6 (this being the bottom level of gates at ORT) where I had positioned myself at 17:45 in order to be at the gate 5 minutes before the gates opened. For the next +- 20 minutes nothing changed on the flight screens. The was no 'Go to Gate' sign for flight FA360 and the gate remained unchanged at E6 on the flight screens. The flight screen at Gate E6 was showing a flight for Margate and so due to the numerous delays and cancellations at the airport, I was under the impression that the Port Elizabeth flight would depart after this Margate flight at Gate E6. This was not the case. At approximately 18:15 when I once again looked at the flight screens, the gate for flight FA360 had changed to gate C13. There was no ‘Go to Gate’ sign showing on that flight. I rushed to Gate C13 only to find the flight screen at the gate displaying Flight FA360 to Port Elizabeth as ‘Closed’. When I approached the 2 Safair employees, the 2 ladies had told me that the flight had departed. When asked if there was a Gate change, they both replied ‘Yes’ there was a gate change. When asked ‘why there was no loud speaker informing passengers of this change?’, they replied that there was an employee of the airport telling people about the gate change. I then asked these 2 ladies if the flight screens are not working at the airport as the 'Go to Gate' sign was not visible and the Gate Change only came on at 18:15. Both of them replied that ORT had been having issues with their monitors. What since ensued at the Safair counter at OR Thambo is inexplicable and I simply cannot type out my anger at your Safair staff. The call centre staff also could not assist me with anything and blamed me for 'missing' my flight and have told me that I am in the wrong.

"""greeted by a professional crew""",8,2018-01-12,"Having needed to book last-minute, we were very pleased to find that FlySafair had reasonable fares a few hours before departure. Flew from Cape Town to Johannesburg. The experience started at check-in, unfortunately the priority queue was slower than the normal queue due to passengers being let forward due to needing special assistance or running late. However, as soon as we got onboard, we were greeted by a professional crew and the whole boarding process was very organised. Legroom was adequate, however the seatback was rather short, meaning that sleeping was uncomfortable for anybody taller than 175cm. In-flight service was BOB with very reasonable prices. In Johannesburg our luggage was delivered within a reasonable timeframe. All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to book flySafair again.",True,Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cape Town to Johannesburg ,January 2018,4,4,,3,4,,True,
"""I had to give up my bag""",3,2018-01-09,"I sat in Seat 3E, which is right behind the exit row seats. This is considered a premium seat which I paid for. As all frequent flyers know, the exit row needs to be kept clear and passengers normally would put their bags in the overhead bins for takeoff as per instructions. ""Please place all bags in overhead bins or under the seat in front of you"". Safair has a policy of allowing and recommending that the exit row places their bags under their own seat. I ended up sitting in a so called premium seat with a large bag where I would normally place my small bag and my feet. I complained but cabin crew confirmed that this is policy and I had to give up my bag to be placed in overhead bin. I never got it back till I had landed, so I could not read my book. I think everyone and all other airlines can see the problem with this policy. I would never put my bag where someone elses feet go. There is the obvious theft opportunity and possible damage if some kicked your bag. Anyway, warning to all about premium seat and weird policies. The seats are also pretty small.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,George to Johannesburg,January 2018,1,1,,3,1,,False,
"""the worst airline to travel on""",1,2017-12-19,"Johannesburg to George. I recommend to stay clear of FlySafair! After sitting at the airport for over 5 hours, we were told at 20h00 “the flight was cancelled”. We boarded the plane earlier and then was told to disembark after an hour. Many families with young children who did not live in Gauteng had to find alternative accommodation with no assistance from Flysafair. Not to mention old people who had no means of additional transport nor accommodation that time of night! Cash refunds were refused, which meant you were forced to use Flysafair the next day. Flying Safair has cost us an additional R5000 in one day and we never reached our destination as booked online at least 2 months before the time. There were many different excuses for cancelling the flight. If an airline cancels more than one flight on a day and both times the reasons are “technical” you have to start worrying about the state of the planes they are using. They are not the cheapest if you read their fine print and their customer service is non-existent. I have travelled to most European countries, the East and Africa over the last 15 years with many airlines.

"""disgusted at the service""",2,2017-12-07,"Cape Town to Johannesburg. I am disgusted at the service I received at Flysafair, I had booked my ticket through Travelstart and I was asked how many bags I would to pay for, I then paid for 3 bags when doing my booking considering the fact that I was booking 6 return flights, from Johannesburg to Cape Town and back again, the cost for the bags was R450, which was calculated at R150 a bag. Once the online check in was opened, I went online to check in and I selected our 6 seats next to each other however when I got to the airport air boarding passes had different seats numbers, I was very unhappy with this because I was traveling with kids who were traveling by plane for the first time and I had to seat my children with strangers how upsetting. In any case I decided to do the online check again when it was time to come back and guess what we were placed in different seats again and to top it off I was told that I had not paid for my luggage and I had to now pay an additional R750 for the 3 bags because that is airport fees. I am very angry at the bad service I received, be careful of these cheap airflights they actually not cheap and are actually a rip off. Why pay for luggage, when I'm already traveling with you guys, I would much rather use Mango or Khulula next time.

Very user friendly website meant that I selected the flights, booked, paid for, and checked in, all within 10 minutes. Prices were below competitors on this route. Both flights on time, aircraft was clean and crew seemed friendly enough. Did not order any catering. The only reason to drop 1 point from 10/10 is that the person I travelled with checked in to the aisle seat, and I to the window seat, hoping for a free seat in the middle (no one will take that seat when on line checking in), but the middle seat was filled by airport check in staff. That's fine for a full flight, but when there are empty rows forward and behind why squeeze everyone together?
