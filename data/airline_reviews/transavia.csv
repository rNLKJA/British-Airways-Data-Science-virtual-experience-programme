Obviously, no cleaning of the plane has been done - we have found some used napkins on our seats. Speaking of the seats, those were extremely uncomfortable.

"""flying with you annually for the past 7 years. Never again""",1,2022-05-12,"I have never been so offended by a service provider as this airline. First off, does this company even exist, as far as customer service is concerned, apart from over the phone? There is certainly no customer service at their counter at Schiphol airport. I was just told to get in touch by phone. A ticket I had purchased with them allows me to rebook my flight any number of times during a period of one year. The flight was initially booked for December 2021 but had to be rebooked when the Netherlands went into hard lockdown. I could not rebook the flight for the desired date of December 2022 as the airline had no flight schedule in place for the winter 2022 season. I was therefore forced to rebook the ticket to an unwanted date (March 2022). Come March 2022, their schedule was still not out so I had to rebook to another unwanted date (April 2022), so as not to lose the ticket, incurring extra charges on both occasions, all for no purpose. As the (unwanted) flight date drew near, and, with a winter 2022 schedule still not out and no more available dates left to book past April 2022, I contacted the airline to ask for a voucher/credit but was denied one, resulting in the ticket being forfeited. A customer forfeiting a ticket because of administrative issues i.e. being forced to book unwanted dates only to forfeit the ticket? I have a right to a booking, to hold on to that booking, and to rebook my flight to the desired date. None of those rights have been respected. International flights can be booked a year in advance, apparently not in this instance. What do you call it when an airline forces you to book unwanted dates and incur extra charges only to forfeit your ticket. I have a term for it. Let the reader judge. What makes it worse is their agents’ unprofessionalism and/or deliberate evasion of the subject matter. When I asked them for a voucher and pointed out there were no more dates to rebook their responses, included, for example: ""I understand your situation, however, as per company policies we won't be able to offer you a voucher. Our winter season flight will be out towards the end of April. However, once (they mean “since”) the flight is booked for tomorrow, if you do not want to lose the ticket, please change the route and date of your ticket. You can try and change it for October, so you do not have to change it again before the winter season flights are out.” This is just one example of the astonishing drivel I have received as a response. How can I change the flight for October if there are no flights in October, the subject matter being the Dubai-Amsterdam leg? How can I even “change it again (in April I assume) before the winter season flights are out” when there are no more flights dates left to rebook to? And even if there were, just to incur unnecessary costs? Is this deliberate evasion of the topic or lack of knowledge or what?

"""was denied a service I had paid for""",1,2021-05-22,"I arrived at checkin at 08.30 with the flight departing at 9.15. The employee receiving me at the waiting line informed me that he can't let me proceed to the check-in desk because it is closed. I objected letting him know that it is 45 minutes before the flight and that there is still time to board the plain. I later found out at the Transavia website that the formal SLA is 40 minutes, so he had no right to deny me entrance on that excuse. I convinced him to let me proceed to the desk. While waiting in front of the desk for a decision there was a lot of back and forth between the employee appearing to be in charge next to the desk and the boarding gate. They finally reached the decision to let me in as I was on time. Upon inspecting my PCR test (as an email on my phone), the employee at the desk clicked on a link directing him to the Dutch government website instead of the attached PDF containing the PCR test. In this confusion his instinctive response was to tell me that Transavia doesn't accept this test, although he wasn't looking at the actual PCR certificate but a government web page. I complained saying that I had used Transavia's services 3 months ago with a PCR test from the same authority. Without any sign of self-doubt or hesitation he informed the person in charge that my PCR was invalid.  I was directed to the help desk and talked to the employee there. She asked how much I paid for my certificate and where I had received it. She then proceeded to acknowledge that my PCR was valid and we went together back to the checkin desk. After, informing the staff that they had bounced me off for no reason 10 minutes ago and that they should have let me in, they reverted back to the argument that I had arrived too late anyway. Of course at that point it was indeed too late. So, I guess from my point of view I arrived 5 min before the checkin formally closes with a valid PCR certificate and was denied a service I had paid for. The worst part is that nobody seemed to bother too much about it let alone utter an apology. They were behaving like it is another day at the office and that it sucks for me but rules are rules.

I show her the paid for and confirmed flight, she looks again, and says I do not exist. Then, she asks her supervisor to check. This supervisor goes for 45 minutes and comes back saying that she can see my Amsterdam - Atlanta flight, but no flight on Transavia. The reason I was given for the mess was that the Delta ""system"" did not send the reservation to the KLM/Transavia ""system"" (as if that's something I should fix for them!). She then asks me to ""call Delta"", and expects me to resolve a problem that occurred between Transavia and Delta, without my own knowledge! After that, I had to ask her to find me a phone, since I could not use my own to call internationally. She takes me to their reservation desk, and the agents there start shouting at me as if it was my fault that I needed to make a call in their office; a call that they should've done (In fact, I was asked to find the Delta phone number myself!). At that point, my flight had already departed, and after reaching Delta myself (since the Transavia agents never called for me, instead they shouted at me to get out), and being rebooked on a flight the next day, I go to these agents to check whether they can see my reservation. Once again, they say that I don't exist in their system! After another long discussion with them, I was given someone on the phone from Transavia, who said that Delta did indeed book me, but Transavia decided to cancel my flight on their leg twice because of ""payment"". I tried to explain to her that this makes no sense, since my connecting flights are confirmed, I have a payment receipt, a confirmed ticket number from Delta, and everything is in order. She again repeats the same thing. After all this mess, I return to my newly booked hotel, contact Transavia by email.

To begin, every single time I fly with them, they make such a stink, bothering every single person about their baggage. Instead of asking if anyone would like to check their carry-on baggage for free before boarding, knowing that they don't have enough space in the plane (and they know, because it's been a problem every single time I've flied with them), they always tell people to rearrange their baggage so that it fits their requirements during boarding, holding up the line and wasting everyones time. This last trip, our flight was delayed by an hour, and instead of using this time efficiently, to ensure quick and stress-free boarding, the staff did nothing until everyone was in line, when a gruff, rude man immediately tagged my bag as being ""not guaranteed to fit in the plane's carry-on compartments."" My bag weighed 6kg, if not less, and fit exactly their requirements for the smaller carry-on that is granted to every passenger. When we started boarding, the staff was coldly telling every other person in line that they had to put their shopping bags/tiny purses etc. inside their main baggage or their couldn't enter the plane. Everyone is stressed, people are held up waiting in line for everyone to conform to this airline's illogical and stupid rules, and we get delayed another half hour in addition to the lateness of the plane. Not one staff member apologized for the delay except the pilot right before take off, and the same man who tagged my bag earlier seemed to revel in the fact that I had to check it. In addition, the lack of logic to these ridiculous regulations astounds me. Before entering the plane, the staff proclaimed that there was no room on the plane for more baggage, but upon entering, we notice there would be plenty of room for baggage if people were just told to keep their coats under their seats.  One more thing is that this is an airline that likes to blame its client. On my flight from Paris to Barcelona, they decided that it was the fault of the people on the plane who ""didn't respect their baggage policy"" that this was why we were later than normal. And they made this very clear to us. But the real problem was that they forgot to check our IDs at the gate while boarding because they were so distracted harassing people about their bags that they forgot. They forgot to check IDs! Because of bags! Then they had to make everyone get out their baggage from the compartments to check them inside the aircraft. Beyond disorganized - if it wasn't so aggravating it might actually be so ridiculous it's amusing. Like I could almost write a comedy sketch about this. But no.

"""no apologies, nothing""",1,2015-12-10,"In my 27 years of flying, this flight with Transavia was the worst experience I've had, which is saying a lot because I fly with multiple budget airlines. I had already checked in online, but I had to check in again at the counter at the airport. Upon checking in, the gruff clerk weighed my bag and said that I needed to check it in. I had carefully packed the bag in accordance with the carry on rules, which is below 10kg. She stated that the limit was 8kg, which it is not, and I had checked multiple times to ensure this. She begrudgingly let us take it with us, saying it was not guaranteed that it could be carried onto the flight. We were then notified that boarding was delayed. No reasons, no explanation, nothing. We would be updated hourly. 2 hours after the scheduled take off time they finally had us line up for a measly drink voucher. Most of us had been here from early morning and it was nearing noon.

Then he stated that France has lifted this visa, and was requiring people to have a visa for France specifically. This was merely a rumor and France had not done such a thing. This poorly informed clerk then rudely said that I need a visa when I clearly did not, and upon me showing proof online of such info, he leered at me and told me to step aside as he let everyone else in.

"""the worst in 20 years of flying""",1,2015-10-08,"No compensation given for misleading statements. I was in Malta and experienced decompression sickness due to diving – 24h after, my airline refused entry to my flight for medical reasons, and said to book a flight with extra oxygen on board. With all flights booked and my airline needing one week to provide oxygen, I call Transavia to book any flight to Europe that can guarantee a bottle of oxygen (I should have been at work already at this time so I decide to try and travel through a connection city back to London). The staff answers that the flight HV5774 from Malta to Amsterdam, 24 hours later, can be booked with a bottle of oxygen guaranteed - I only buy my ticket with them on the basis of the availability of this bottle, otherwise I would choose a different airline, as it is about my medical safety. The booking confirmation says: ""Transavia.com will provide extra oxygen on board"". When I check-in, I ask the employee at the counter if the oxygen is available for me. She makes a call and confirms that the oxygen is available. But once in the plane, a person from Transavia comes and says ""I'm sorry madam but we have no oxygen onboard - are you really going to need it?"" I had to make a call at my own risk and realised that Transavia had falsely stated the availability of oxygen – and not just one time! – and ignored my medical requirements. Desperate to get home as I already had 500€ of extra flight costs, weighting pros and cons, I decide to test my luck and stay on the flight. The person next to me – who happens to be a nurse – found the whole situation unacceptable, and proposed to check out on me regularly during the flight. Then I asked for a small bottle of water to help in case I’m not feeling well. The employees refused to give me the bottle and insisted on me paying 2,70€ if I wanted it.  Finally, the flight arrived with 30min delay, causing me to be unable to pick-up my luggage at the arrival as I would otherwise miss my next flight to London. I had to leave it behind and fill-in a form at the ""lost and found"" in London. (my luggage was “lost” for 5 days). I contacted Transavia to complain. They started by telling me it was my fault because I made my request with “too short a notice” and they need 72 hours. The employee answered then “we cannot give you a refund” and proposed a gift voucher. But I needed to first buy a ticket and then they would refund it (even though they just said that for my complaint no refund is possible – and anyway, who would trust a company that says “we will refund” when they just said “we have extra oxygen” and it was a lie?). Running out of patience I decide to accept the deal. The final joke was when I actually tried to buy a flight: I realised Transavia does not fly from London, so I will never be able to use what I was given!

This isn't really the fault of the airline, they blamed the airport, but there was too much confusion in the run up to the point where they opened the flight. The ground staff could see there was an issue and should have opened boarding earlier. The result of which was those with boarding cards issued in the airport got on the plane and were sitting on it for over an hour before the doors closed. Moreover when we eventually took off over an hour late we landed in Orly as the busses were leaving for Paris. No trains, no nothing which meant hanging about waiting to get into the as a result of this it was nearly one am before I got tomy hotel.

This was an appalling service that I absolutely don't recommend to anyone.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,,False
Transavia customer review,8,2013-09-08,ORY-KEF. Online check-in was not working but the check-in at the airport was fast an efficient. No meal included but the flight is so late that you probably would not want to eat anyway. Helpful and understanding staff overall a good experience considering the price.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,5,,,True
Transavia customer review,9,2013-08-27,I flew with Transavia 3 weeks ago from Eindhoven to Tenerife. We had some problems but I liked how the airline dealt with them. Also we flew very cheaply. The food was okay. The inflight movie was a good movie but you needed to buy headsets! I really can recommend the airline for it's customer service on-time and excellent cabin attendants. Shame about the movie but it's a good airline and I recommend it.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,,True
Transavia customer review,6,2013-08-19,4 Aug 2013 Porto - Funchal (Madeira) TO 3406. Return 12 Aug 2013 Funchal (Madeira) - Porto TO 3965. It is a low cost airline but compared to others it is probably best that I've travelled. Checked in fast and went to assigned seats.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,4,,,True
Transavia customer review,,2013-07-17,Flight delayed due to mechanical reasons 2 hour updates until they told us a plane would be coming in 6 hours from Paris when we were in Santorini. I don't know why they couldn't send one from Athens which is 30 mins away. Ended up being 12 hours in the airport they told us at 19.00 so there was no option to arrange a new flight. Staff rude and not helpful even when just asking for details. Got to Paris at 3am instead of 3pm.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,1,,,1,,,False
Transavia customer review,,2013-06-19,My worst (non)-flying experience. It was during the 11-14th June 2013 strike by French air traffic controllers. Our Transavia flight was due to leave at 19.00 on 12th June. First they pushed departure back to 20.30 then to 00.30 then 00.45. Finally the plane arrived and the passengers disembarked and we anticipated that at last we would be leaving but then they told us the flight was cancelled because they needed the plane elsewhere. No other explanation. The staff maintained minimal levels of politeness but didn't really seem to care very much. They also told us they would not refund the money would not offer another flight hotel or transport really unbelievable. Their recommendation was that we should go home very helpful at 1 in the morning if you live in Spain! The outward flight was also delayed but at least they got us there. The cabin was cramped and the seats pretty uncomfortable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,,1,,,False
Transavia customer review,9,2013-06-09,Flew from Malaga to Amsterdam. The trip was pleasant and comfortable the staff helpful. Check in was slow with a lot of people travelling. Amsterdam was efficient. I wish all flights were as easy as this.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,5,,,True
Transavia customer review,9,2013-06-04,Flew Rotterdam-Prague return. Both flights clean punctual and cabin crew helpful. Green livery perhaps even more garish than Ryanair's. However just 70EUR for a round-trip Rotterdam is a fantastic airport and there were no problems in Prague. There was even IFE which was an episode of Modern Family and was more than adequate for the 90 minute flight. Would certainly fly with again when I'm back in the Netherlands.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,,True
Transavia customer review,8,2013-05-12,Flew back from VLC to AMS on 11/5/2013 with the larger Boeing 737-800 which was fully booked. Unfortunately for some reason it was not possible to check-in online. Arriving 2.5 hours before departure the check-in desk didn't open for another half hour. Check-in was smooth with seats at row 1A/B still available (more legroom). Flight departed 10 minutes late. The aircraft was fully booked but staff managed to get everybody seated in a short time (some seats had been checked-in twice but staff handled this efficiently and friendly). As the computer for credit-card / pin payments wasn't working it was only possible to pay cash for the drinks and meals no in-flight sales. Flight arrived on schedule in AMS but as it landed on the Polderbaan it takes almost another 15 minutes to arrive at the gate (D56). Baggage arrived approx. a half hour later which by Schiphol standards is pretty good.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,,True
Transavia customer review,8,2013-05-12,Selected Transavia for a short break. Outward from AMS to VLC on 5/5. Check-in was done 24 hours in advance and was easy and changed our seats from row 19E / 19F to row 1D / 1E. This row gives you a bit more legroom which is very nice as my wife and I both have long legs. Flight left Amsterdam on time. Staff helpful and attentive. We arrived approx. 20 minutes early and disembarking was quick. Baggage arrived a few minutes later. All in all a pleasant flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,,True
Transavia customer review,6,2013-05-04,FCO-RTM I rarely travel by air while in Europe and had no expectation with Transavia turned out it was a pretty good flight. Cabin attendants good and helpful. There was only problem during check in when we saw the schedule on FCO departure information screen showing the flight is actually depart one hour before the scheduled time with no explanation. Luckily we were at the airport early and asked the check in staff about that and she had no clue. Other passengers were also confused and unaware of the change. However flight departed on the original schedule. Apart from that the flight was fine and on time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,,True
Transavia customer review,9,2013-04-24,From BLQ to EIN both flights in the afternoon in regular weather situation on a 747-700. Crew were quite fair with passengers both at the airport and on board. They passed only once with the trolley with beverages and food. Average seat space and clean. Just a little delay at on-boarding operations. Online check-in very useful but only for Eindhoven airport it would be great having it at Bologna too. Everything was as one would expect for a low cost company to me and most important I had no bad experience in hidden additional costs as I've had with other (more famous) companies.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,,True
Transavia customer review,2,2013-04-16,AMS-FAO-AMS. Going out on a GOL aircraft (inside) more or less ok. Flying Blue members can use the lounge at Schiphol but not fast track. Transavia has finally added the possibility to check in online for return flights but this was not working for Faro airport due to technical difficulties said the website. Return flight incredibly uncomfortable new seats are extremely small and seat pitch is just agony. Although this flight also has a KLM flight number no miles are accrued and no lounge access in Faro.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,,False
Transavia customer review,7,2013-01-09,Flight from NCE to AMS. Punctual flight arrived on time but had to taxi all the way to the gate from the furthest runway of the airport. Good service on board very nice cabin crew. Very busy flight on busy route after Christmas and New Year not the cheapest fares.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,3,,,True
Transavia customer review,1,2012-11-25,Faro to Rotterdam. Poor safety standards - took a long time to board passengers because of the amount of hand luggage. Then when the flight came to land the steward started retrieving the bags of the passengers who had been forced to put their bags in lockers several rows from their seats. As we were on final approach passengers started wandering up and down the aisles to identify bags. Then the bags were left in the aisle as we were touching down.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,,False
Transavia customer review,,2012-11-21,"HV5078 NCE-RTM on 14 Oct. Bad weather resulting in partial airport closure. Initially flight delayed by 3 hours but passengers were allowed to check in and wait at departure gate. Flight further delayed and rescheduled to leave next morning (12 hours delay). Passengers forced to leave departure level to the main level and ""recheck in"" again next morning. Complete chaos at the airport ground personnel never bothered nor cared to arrange hotels for stranded passengers blaming adverse weather and non availability of hotels. Dinner coupon of 5 euro offered which you could buy a stale cold sandwich. Spent entire night sitting and waiting and thus flew out next morning after spending 15 hours. Transavia could have been kind enough and courteous to offer free tea/coffee on the flight way back considering this huge delay.",False,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,,,1,,,False
Transavia customer review,5,2012-08-21,Flew from Paris to Mykonos. Very long lines. Check-in staff gossiping with their colleagues. Plane took 45 minutes to take off after departure time. Seats weren't cleaned from previous flight (crumbs and chewing gum). 3 euros for a glass of water.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Transavia customer review,8,2012-04-15,TXL-AMS. Flight was on time but seats on 737 cramped. Attentive flight attendants. One of them tried to make announcements in German but that was rather embarrassing. Offering web check-in from foreign airports would be a huge improvement. But paid 39 euro all in so Transavia can be a great deal.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Transavia customer review,7,2012-03-13,ALC-AMS. Check-in at Alicante was a mess if only you could check-in online. Onboard happy and friendly crew. New 737 with decent legroom overhead entertainment. Deplaning took ages. Travel this route every month every flight is different but in general ok very dependant on the crew.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Transavia customer review,3,2012-03-12,VLC-AMS. The boarding arrangements appear to be poorly managed with little evidence of co-ordination or teamwork. The already delayed flight was subjected to additional delay because of the inefficient boarding system. Cabin crew stood aside as passengers took their time to place their luggage while blocking the aisle. There is little sense of urgency or purpose on the part of the crew. I narrowly missed a connecting flight in AMS as a result.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,False
Transavia customer review,9,2012-02-22,Orly-Heraklion return. Tickets are cheap if you buy at least 1 month in advance. All flight on time aircraft clean and modern B737-800. Onboard crew were nice the seats comfortable with good legroom. Both inbound and outward the plane was not full so I moved to another seat without any problems.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Transavia customer review,6,2012-02-14,Paris Orly to Luxor return from Hurghada to Paris Orly. The flights themselves were as good as on any other airline. I appreciate being able to pre-reserve an emergency exit seat for a supplement of 20 Euros. However I have downgraded my score because of one very unpleasant incident - 3 weeks before the return flight I was contacted to be told the flight times had changed from 13.00 on Saturday to 01.55 on Sunday. I found this unacceptable but was able to re-route via Hurghada instead even though this meant an additional 4 hour road journey. But that is preferable to a miserable short half night flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Transavia customer review,3,2012-02-13,No check-in machines available at Alicante and no online check-in so had to queue for boarding card with only hand luggage. On boarding there were other passengers in the seats I had reserved. Passengers refused to move and spoke only Dutch but none of the crew came to help there was no welcome aboard. My seat was broken and would not return to the upright position and when asked to rectify this on landing I explained the seat was broken only to receive the reply that Transavia is a low fare airline. I was offered no assistance whatsoever.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Transavia customer review,2,2011-09-10,I was supposed to be at the airport 3.5 hrs prior to departure but the desk didn't open until 1.5-2 hrs before. No one at the gate until 30 mins before departure. Staff when they finally showed up were unfriendly. Poor service onboard the only service are the trolleys with merchandise I had to opportunity to buy a drink just once. Only 5 kg is allowed for hand luggage and only 1 bag.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Transavia customer review,10,2011-07-12,Djerba-Nantes. Operated by the Dutch Transavia since the French sister company had a broken down plane. Crew all Dutch but Dutch purser spoke almost fluently French when addressing passengers in aisle. Very attentive crew (better than French Transavia crew) who were present a lot in aisle even during a night flight to Nantes. Pity the entertainment program was not in French but Dutch subtitled (probably the result of the Dutch branch taking over this particular flight). Very pleasant experience!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Transavia customer review,10,2011-06-26,Amsterdam-Athens. Transavia was the third airline used on a recent trip and were by far the best. From easy online check in to modern clean aircraft with friendly efficient staff. The on-board snack menu and the cost of the items were about the same as other low cost airlines and entertainment was ok for a short flight. This flight also left on time which is a rarity these days.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Transavia customer review,5,2011-06-23,Paris Orly to Granada Spain return. Web check-in available and working except for seat allocation not possible to change it even after ringing Transavia hotline (miserable service). Aircraft clean and modern poor inflight entertainment cabin crew friendly but not very professional. Good food and drink service - as a low cost airline everything has to be paid for but quality is OK. Aircraft delayed both inbound and outward without any explanation or apologies given approx. 1 hr late on each leg this airline does not look very efficient however the price paid is OK and Paris Orly much better than Roissy even though it is still a bad airport where something goes always wrong this time the bus to disembark was not there and we had to wait for 30 mins in the aircraft. Transavia seems OK if you go on holiday and are not too fussy about excellence or punctuality.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Transavia customer review,1,2011-06-16,Amsterdam-Barcelona and back. While going I had 1 checked bag and 3 handbags - no problem. I paid for 1 bag. On the way back exactly the same bags and no extras but I was forced to check 3 instead of 1 and was charged 30 euros. The reason the bags even though 5-6 kgs (within the 10 Kg limit) were an inch or two outside the dimensions. When I got on the flight half of the people were cribbing as they went thru the same and the other half were carrying large bags in the cabin. It was sheer misconduct of one of the ladies checking in this flight. If you went to the man you were fine - if you went to this lady she was forcing everyone to check. But we couldn't do anything she was the boss.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Transavia customer review,5,2011-05-22,AMS-BCN-AMS was able to book a day return a day ahead for 140 euros. Online check works only for a few airports including Amsterdam. Could use fast track security and KLM Lounge with Elite plus card but no miles on flights. Transavia colored 737 but inside it was half a GOL plane and half another airline with ridiculous change of decor half way the aircraft. Seat pitch is tight no inflight screens. Catering is for sale only with above average prices. Crew just ok. Arrival in old terminal in Barcelona that looks bad with all stores closed. Transavia does not allow for web check-in on return flights so had very long queue. I was told the flight was full but plane left with 20% open seats so I guess the remaining passengers got stuck at check in.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,False
Transavia customer review,4,2011-01-16,Malaga - London Gatwick return. I was going to travel for a return flight with Monarch Airlines which got cancelled and got switched to a flight with Transavia.

Transavia customer review,,2010-09-30,"Booked a flight to Barcelona with Transavia on November 14th. Now they are informing me that they intend to cancel all flights to Barcelona but they will not refund money until the final decision. And they are not even state a date then they will made that decision. ""Very soon"" they tell. 10 days is very soon? They do not tell anything about will they fly or not but do not return money. And meanwhile ticket prices for other companies are increasing. Very unreliable company.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Transavia customer review,9,2010-08-22,Paris-Oporto. Departure from Paris Orly airport much closer to town and customer friendly. Easy check in the evening before via their website possibility to choose your seat for free! Easy luggage check in at the airport no queue same for security checks. Welcoming and attentive crew. As a low cost you pay for a drink or sandwich but you can have hold luggage for free. Oporto-Paris Orly. Easy check-in this airport is wonderfully organized again departure and arrival on time a bit difficult to get luggage at Orly but still much better than CDG.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Transavia customer review,,2010-05-23,Last February I booked a return flight with Transavia Toulon-Amsterdam for June 9 return June 14. This morning I had a message that my return flight was re-booked for June 16 and that there would be extra charges if I could not accept the date change. This is absolutely unacceptabler.

Transavia customer review,4,2010-03-16,Marrakesh-Amsterdam viaAgadir. Chaotic boarding in RAK all pax disembarked at Agadir due to cleaning and fuelling. Flight back to ams took another 4 hours. Transavia offers B737/700 or 800 service with overhead ife and audio - everything onboard is charged for earphones 3EUR sandwiches 4EUR water 2.50EUR which should be free on a 6 hour flight. This a la carte buy on board service takes a long time crew friendly and focussed on selling products. Not recommended due to hidden high extras. .,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Transavia customer review,4,2009-10-10,RAK-ORY. Online booking effortless. I later paid 15 euros online to reserve an exit row seat. The 737-800 was in excellent condition - interiors even a bit stylish and the music hip. Service friendly. Food for sale was mostly sandwiches fruit soup and salad and pretty good.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Transavia customer review,1,2009-07-30,Nothing good to say. My flight (Luton-Rotterdam) was cancelled and no information or assistance given whatsoever. They refuse to compensate it according to EU regulations. I have been using them before quite regularly and cancellations and delays have happened in the past more than by any other airline. The planes are ok although not very clean. FA are not service oriented although quick and effective. I dont use this airline anymore due to all above mentioned problems. Avoid them.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Transavia customer review,1,2009-07-12,Very disappointing airline. They cancelled our flight to Rotterdam - after they had boarded us on the plane for a long time and then we had to disembark. Very mixed messages about how we were to get to Rotterdam. We only found out after re-booking on another airline that they were offering an alternative flight but from another airport - and this was already about 5 hours after our scheduled departure. Now refuse to give any compensation.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Transavia customer review,3,2009-06-28,AMS to Venice. Flight on time (only half full) fast boarding etc. For tall people UNSUITABLE. You have to be smaller than 1.90 or with short legs because legspace is absent. This was compensated by the nice crew IFE and fast delivery of luggage. I'd like to note them as 2 STAR for objective criteria but give them 3 for the nice crew and speediness of operations.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Transavia customer review,4,2009-06-24,Luton - Rotterdam return. First time with Transavia so not to sure what to expect. Luton is not my first choice of airport but the check in and security checks were very quick and efficient. Boarding was on time and trouble free. It is so much easier when you have a seat allocated (unlike some other airlines). FA's attentive and friendly. The 737 -700 was comfortable enough for this short flight. Return trip the following day was a similar experience . All in all very good value for money.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Transavia customer review,1,2009-06-16,Rome to Copenhagen took over 6 (six!) hours delayed with a detour around Napoli and much waiting. The cabin crew herded passengers around the plane several times during the boarding and nobody from the company expressed any kind of regret for the delays or discomfort. Furthermore baggage was delayed by more than 30 minutes when we finally arrived in Copenhagen. My experience with this company was altogether bad and I will never fly with them again. Avoid them at all cost.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Transavia customer review,4,2009-06-09,Return flight Paris-Funchal. Funchal airport is excellent. Clean aircraft and almost in time. Cabin crew was attentive and smiling.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Transavia customer review,4,2009-06-09,Some carriers are flying to Alicante and Valencia but transavia.com is still my first pick. affordable rates when you book early. Although food and drinks onboard pretty expensive (cup of coffee 25 euro's). Even so they offer great service on a short flight. Inflight entertainment is shown crew is professional and the seats are pretty comfortable for these short hubs. Cabin crew speaks fluent english. Even free magazines are sometimes onboard and so are newspapers on the homeward leg. Modern planes clean overall and toilets that are cleaned after the flight.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
