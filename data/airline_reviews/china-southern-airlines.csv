"""Service is very consistent""",9,2019-11-24,"London to Sydney return via Guangzhou. I had been a little anxious but I ended up very impressed. The website is truly dreadful and we battled with it. However we were able to preselect seats. This is free for some seats and many of the other seats are available for a nominal fee. Online checkin was a bit glitchy but there is a dedicated online checkin line at the airport and because people don't seem to use online checkin, on each occasion it allowed us to completely avoided queuing. The baggage allowance in Economy is 2 x 23kg bags.  All four flights left on time. The flight schedules were great and far better on the kangaroo route than BA or QF. I chose daylight flights on all sectors (except London - Guangzhou). China Southern give you a free transit hotel if your flight involves a transit stop of more than eight hours. This worked well and broke up the return flight when we weren't actually staying in Guangzhou, although it's worth noting that it's not a particularly quick process. You first need to get a transit visa (which involves plenty of hanging around) and then go to a desk in the arrivals hall where you can choose your hotel. You then wait to be escorted to a bus which will take you to the hotel. It took more than two hours from arrival to get to my room and the hotel wanted to put me on a return bus 3.5 hrs before the flight left. I pushed that back by half an hour but still, given my transit was 16 hrs it was fine. An 8 hr transit wouldn't give you much time in the hotel! As for the flights, there was plenty of legroom, particularly on the 787. Service was a little robotic (few smiles) but very efficient and consistent. Two hot meals were served on each sector and the crew had (uninspiring) snacks if you asked for them between meals. Drinks options were limited (few people seemed to be drinking alcohol and they kept running out of Diet Coke). The IFE system was the best I have seen and there was enough content, albeit not as much in English as, say, on BA. A minor gripe - they insist on closing the windows on daylight flights. It didn't matter on the 787 as you can still see out and unlike other airlines they don't lock the windows in the dark position, but on the A330 it was a pain. My conclusion? I worked for BA for many years, latterly working with their inflight product. CZ was in general far, far better in economy than BA.

"""Expedia ticket that was unchangeable""",5,2019-08-25,"New York to Vientiane via Guangzhou. Part of the problem is that I booked through Expedia. I spent more time on the phone about this booking than any other flight. Expedia refers the customer to the CZ website to manage the flight, seat selection, meals, etc. But the website will only open to customers who have booked at the site! Expedia does not link! The U.S. phone number for CZ is Pacific Time, limited daytime hours, and I never had any of my calls answered, even after long waits. I called the office in China, who did answer the phone, and they were helpful; however, when it came time to pay for seat confirmation, only Chinese credit cards were accepted, no MC or Visa or AMEX. So I could not pre-book a seat. I was only able to select a seat when I checked in at JFK on a return flight (after most seats were already assigned). Even worse, without informing me, Expedia booked me on a ticket that was unchangeable!  In this case, I had to purchase an entirely new ticket (through Expedia) for my return flight, for $754, expecting reimbursement. Even though the representative and her supervisor acknowledged that I was not properly informed, it still took considerable effort to get Expedia to agree to reimburse $500. Flight times were on schedule, often arriving early. Connection through Guangzhou is a little difficult, with a long walk to the connection. Boarding is disorganized and a scramble. Onboard, staff are courteous and friendly, with limited but acceptable English. For entertainment, the LED screen is new, bright and crisp, with a relatively good selection of English language programming. Food in Economy is mediocre. In 8 meals, I was served fruit twice and yoghurt once. Chocolate never. Cheese never. No breakfast meal (eggs, potatoes, sausage, pancakes).  Between meals, no peanuts, candy bars, apples, oranges, bananas, chips, or other snacks were available, only boxes of noodle soup. Similarly, there was a very limited selection of drinks. No comfort packs were distributed (eyeshade, toothbrush, etc). I make this trip between Laos and the U.S. frequently, generally using Middle-East carriers (Qatar, Etihad). the trip is very long, generally with 2 connections and significant airport waiting time. This new alternative on CZ has only one quick connection, and a total of only 20 hrs between boarding and disembarking. For this reason alone, I will again select CZ.

They’d just explained us that: ‘’Because the flight from Guanzhou to Paris was cancelled on Oct 16th, 2018 and the system changed you into next flight on next day automatically’’. We required them to find another flight for us. We showed them our ticket with Air Canada to tell them that we couldn’t miss the flight from Paris to Québec. Finally, they found another flight for us to Paris with more connecting flight, 3 flights totally instead of 2 flights. We had no choice and accepted this option. They couldn’t print the boarding pass for us from Amsterdam – Paris since they cooperated with KLM, we had to print it at Amsterdam.

There was an old couple sitting in front of me, and the air stewardesses was super attentive. They asked multiple times if the couple was warm enough, comfortable enough, had hot water, etc. The longer flight (CAN to LAX) was carried out on an Airbus, which I prefer.

All counters and desks were empty, and we had to go around the airport quite a few times asking for China Southern staff, but everyone told us there wasn't anyone as they were closed. At this point we asked for help to a member of staff of Wuhan Airport, he was kind enough to call China Southern on our behalf and ask about what had happened. China Southern's customer service told him that they couldn't provide us with a hotel because we didn't make a reservation beforehand, which is clearly not true, as we repeatedly contacted China Southern about making a reservation and we were always told that no reservation was needed. China Southern offered no help whatsoever and we saw ourselves at 2am in Wuhan Airport with no hotel and a stopover of almost 14 hours. We had to find and pay for a hotel by ourselves after wasting a lot of time seeking help from China Southern, which didn't come at any point. Furthermore, we were not the only passengers with the same problem as there were other passengers from South Korea on our same flight who were also left with no hotel and no help. It seems clear that no China Southern staff was present at the transfer counters or the airport in general. I have put a formal complaint by phone, email and in person and it's now been over a month and no one from China Southern has gotten back to me and keeps brushing me off by telling me that my complain has been ""forwarded to the relevant department"".

I was able to check in for the short flight Seoul to Beijing on their website but unable to book a seat for the Beijing to Amsterdam connection, my partner had no issues for both flights. In the end we did have to go to the counter and we don't have a lot of experience with the ground staff of CSA as check in was done by Korean Air in Seoul. It was an overall pleasant experience with the Korean Air staff but they were unable to book the whole trip for us (after Amsterdam we had a connecting flight home to Ireland) or make any changes to the seats selected. The flight from Seoul to Beijing was uneventful and for the short distance a snack and something to drink was included. Unfortunately the quality of the food can be improved (dry tiny sandwiches with not taste or texture). We were put in economy plus for the flight due to the short layover in Beijing to make it to our connecting flight. There was plenty of legroom but the plane was old and outdated. Unlike other people's experiences we did have staff waiting for us when we got off the plane in Beijing to help us with the luggage transfer and through Chinese security. It was actually helpful since our flight to Beijing was delayed by half an hour the process needed to be speedy (as others have stated lack of communication with passengers in regards to delays especially in this case when they were well aware that they had 4 international passengers that needed to transfers). Just be prepared to have your hand luggage turned upside down with no respect for personal belongings. I think they ran our bags through the scanner 5 times despite removing all requested items that go through the scanner separately. Initially my partner and I were supposed to be seated apart during the long flight from Beijing to Amsterdam but got lucky since so many people wanted to change seats that we eventually had chance to sit together. Compared to A380 from other airlines there was less legroom in the main deck economy area and the seats were uncomfortable so sleeping was possible just not for long. Again the food was mediocre at best. Dinner was tasteless chicken with more tasteless mash or fish and rice where only the rice and sauce were edible, the veg was pretty undercooked. At least there were a plenty of chances to get water or something else to drink. Breakfast was an omelette, okay but not great. In flight entertainment had a lot of good choices with some recent movies and there was enough to keep us busy during the flight. Only regret is no map to check flight progress and little communication of the staff with passengers where we are. For an international flight I would have hoped to have staff that has decent English unfortunately most of time it was hard to figure out where Chinese ended and English started during announcements.

"""Overall a good airline""",8,2018-09-17,"Toronto to Tianjin via Guangzhou. The meals on these particular routes were Chinese in style; my travel companion, who rarely eats airplane food, called the meals delicious and I found the meals quite suited to a Chinese palate. The passengers on both the departure and return flight were very demanding. Despite this, the stewardesses were quick and patient in their services, providing blankets, headphones, and pillows during boarding. China Southern and Xiamen boarded their flights in an orderly fashion and organized their queues in such a way as to prevent passengers from later zones from sneaking into the front. Passengers who did so were told to line up in their queue. On my return leg from Tianjin to Guangzhou, airport staff noticed a random, irrelevant series of digits where my travel document number should have been. This was likely the fault of my travel agent whom I booked the ticket with. Regardless, the check-in staff was not able to check me in, and sent me to a China Southern kiosk to resolve the issue. In the end, the kiosk employee was able to change my ID number in the system to match my travel document so I could be checked in. One event taking away from my high opinion of China Southern was this employee's stubbornness and hesitance to change the travel document number for a low-risk individual who obviously had a valid travel document. She initially told us that it was not possible for her to do so (which was not a truthful statement), and insisted I contact my travel agent, which resulted in my friend and myself having to turn on roaming to call the travel agent back in Canada and was a huge inconvenience. After having no luck, she apparently realized that I had successfully checked into my Guangzhou to Toronto return leg and was convinced that I was legitimate, and then changed my number in the system. In hindsight, she took conservative measures, which are reasonable but in my opinion overkill for a low-risk passenger. She realized that I had little time left, and quickly finished the change and directed me to the supervisor line, which was a saving grace to the ordeal and restored some of my respect for the airline. Ultimately, this had no impact on my flight, but it was a stressful and arguably unnecessarily complicated process. Inflight entertainment has a good selection of both Chinese, international, and Hollywood movies, TV shows, music and games. This was my first time taking a shuttle bus from the gate to the plane (at Guangzhou for the departure leg). Although China Southern communicated gate changes and delays promptly and clearly, the airline did not communicate that we would be riding a shuttle bus. As a result of this, I leisurely took my time and ended up standing for the 10-minute bus ride. Partially my fault, admittedly.

They threw us in an airport and then did not even reach out to us with an update for 12 hours. They then took us to Sharjah, because they did not land the flight in Dubai at the allotted time. All passengers disembarked at Sharjah and zero attention was given to transit passengers (with no UAE Visa and hence no way to leave the airport). The airport manager at Sharjah had to speak to the staff at China Southern, and we basically had to hoard the captain from the previous flight in order to get them to arrange for someone to get us. 6 hours later, they fly us to Dubai (with our luggage still in Sharjah). Now came the icing on the cake. They were completely reluctant and unwilling to arrange us flights to our final destinations despite us continuously begging them to do so, their excuse being ""We are doing it"". We met the most rude China Airlines staff there too. 8 hours into waiting, I had it and bought myself a new Emirates ticket out of Dubai.

I preferred the A330 aircraft on the Melbourne to Guangzhou leg, which seemed to have a bit more legroom and felt less cramped than the Boeing 787 on the Guangzhou to London leg. One of the main problems on the 787 is that the buttons to operate the overhead lights and for example, the volume of the in-flight entertainment are embedded into the end of the armrest. It may be because I am a biggish guy, but I inadvertently switched on the lights and manipulated the entertainment system of the poor girl sitting next to me a few times! The only way to avoid this was to draw my arms close to my body and avoid touching her armrest altogether. Which made things a bit cramped for me. The A330 has a better solution, with all controls contained via the touchscreen on the newer entertainment consoles. The other bugbear is that the use of one's mobile phone is prohibited on this airline -  I understand that this is the policy of China and the airline must tow the line here. Otherwise, there are plenty of pluses. The fares are budget friendly, but it did not feel like a budget experience. The cabin crew were outstanding - always attentive, polite, keeping the plane tidy and providing constant, smiling service. Certainly one of the best experiences I've had with airline staff. The food was also pretty good, when one adjusts their expectations to airline cuisine and does not expect unrealistic, restaurant quality in economy class. It was tasty, nutritious and plentiful enough. Also, the in-flight entertainment provided more than enough options for me in my native language. I watched four good quality films that helped me to pass the time pleasantly. The ads before each film are slightly annoying, but are easily skipped. Overall, would I recommend?

"""not worth it on a long flight""",3,2017-11-28,"Christchurch to London via Guangzhou. Flights were on time and went without any hitches but there is a major problem with this airline, being the smallest seat pitch I have encountered even on a domestic flight let alone a long haul 12 hour flight. Even some of our taller oriental friends were struggling with it. I was fortunate to be able to move to a seat with a vacant seat adjacent and thanks to a kind person at the check-in desk at Heathrow I had a bulkhead seat on my return flight. Unless you are of below average stature I wouldn't recommend this airline, profit comes ahead of customer comfort. The flight attendants were also a bit slap-dash with the service. Coffee was pre-mixed with sugar and milk whether you like it or not, presumably to save the flight attendants a bit of time and effort. Wi-Fi is available at Guangzhou airport if you know that you have to scan your passport at a machine to get a ticket with a password, but for non techno-savvy people, it would be hard to figure out.

China Southern in general does a great job with in-flight service and the quality of seating in business/first; where it falls short and needs a lot of work is in the ground service/transfer service in Guangzhou (which it advertises as excellent but in practice is highly deficient). The crew on CZ304 did a particularly good job and worked very hard during the flight, even by what I regard as very high standards of China Southern. I heard other passengers leave the flight complimenting the crew. Unfortunately China Southern ruins the experience of passengers with the poor way its staff handle transfers at Guangzhou airport — it’s always someone else’s problem and when there are problems, the staff seem always to be missing on the ground.

"""limited English wasn’t so fortunate""",3,2017-11-13,"✅ Verified Review |  Beijing to Amsterdam return. It was a mixed experience, flying with China Southern. There were good and bad things and I’ll start with the bad: On the outgoing leg of my flight, I left my rather expensive noise cancelling headphones under my seat as I exited the plane. I was seated all the way in the back of the plane (in economy) and I was one of the last passengers to leave the aircraft. An hour after disembarking I realized my mistake and immediately contacted the staff in Amsterdam airport. They told me to file a report with the lost and found office, which I immediately did. A week later, nothing had turned up. I called the lost and found office to double check, but there was nothing. I called China Southern but nobody picked up so I emailed them instead, with no result. So how is it possible that a pair of $400 headphones can disappear like that? Since I have no proof, I cannot say that a certain group of people stole my headphones, but I do find it very very suspicious that an expensive item like that can simply vanish from the plane. The worst part is how China Southern handled the episode. I emailed them, describing my experience, only to receive a standard copy and paste response, saying that nobody would ever steal from a plane. All my following replies to the email were just ignored. No response at all. The return leg of the flight was better, but that was mostly because the staff in Amsterdam bumped me to premium economy, which is a lot nicer than economy. I can’t say if it’s worth the money, since I didn’t pay for the upgrade, but I will say that it was a very nice experience. The seats were bigger with more leg room, way more comfortable than economy and even the toilets were more spacious. The crew were mostly friendly and nice, but their limited English wasn’t so fortunate. I had a headache and asked slowly and clearly for an aspirin, which was understood as ice cream by two different flight attendants. I then told them I had pain in my head and pointed at my forehead, after which they brought me a small free toiletry bag. When I finally found someone who was able to understand me, I was told that they didn’t have any aspirins, because it was a serious drug. Somehow this isn’t a problem with other airlines, though. China Southern had free wifi available on the return leg of the flight, which is a great bonus, but in reality it was extremely slow and on top of that it was the Chinese version of the internet with no access to google, gmail, youtube, facebook, instagram or any of the sites that westerners use. So all in all, a mixed bag. The flight experience was pretty standard in economy and pretty great in premium economy. But my expensive headphones that simply vanished on the plane, and the complete lack of any kind of assistance from China Southern, left me bitter and I will look elsewhere next time I book a flight.",False,A330,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Amsterdam to Beijing,November 2017,4,1,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",4,3,,1,False

Our flight was booked from Melbourne to Amsterdam via Shenzhen and Beijing and return from Amsterdam to Melbourne via Beijing and Guangzhou. We each thrice checked for visa requirements and were both under the impression that China has a 24-hr transit visa. Wrong! Some cities/airlines do not apply to this. We were taken to the service desk and waited for an hour before they told us our best options were cancel & rebook new flights, or call the airline to find a way around the cities that needed visas, or risk it for the biscuit. We nearly risked it but decided to do our 1st option (despite the prices, it was a safer bet)! So onto asking for a cancellation and refund request. The website was outdated stating that website works were underway (however the dates had passed already), difficult to maneuver as some sections were in Chinese, and when I attempted to apply for a refund, it sent me to a 404 error page. Previous to that, no confirmation emails/texts had been sent to my email address/mobile despite the multiple requests.  We called the airline line, was on hold for hours (as you might've anticipated) and then were told to call the office in Australia (which was closed due to the public holiday) and that they couldn't help us. After insisting, they told us to send an email with details of our trip and our passports and to call back when we received a response email regarding our cancellation/refund, which shouldn't take longer than 10-15 minutes. Email sent. 20 minutes passed. No email. So we call back, wait for another half hour and (of course) speak to a different agent. This agent says very abruptly ""There's a 30-minute processing time from when we receive your email. Call back when you get it. Bye."" And she hangs up before we get a chance to respond with anything. It's been over an hour and 15 minutes now and we still haven't received an email. Bottom line: Don't fly with this airline if you're a foreigner and don't have any intention of going to China. Their tickets might seem cheap if you're transiting through the country, but unless you have a Chinese passport, prepare yourself for tagteaming and chasing customer service. If you do travel with this airline, check all connecting airports to ensure they qualify under the 24-hr transit permit, and if not, then you'll need a Chinese visa which takes >3-4 weeks to process.

I told him to just tell me where exactly because you keep saying over there, where is over there? While i am speaking to him, he suddenly acted as if he cannot hear and see me. I kept repeating my question but he did not respond and continued on with this behavior. So after asking around we found out that we need to verify using our passports if our boarding pass is already available for printing from a self service machine so that we can queue on the checkin counters with the shorter line. At the self service machine there was only 1 staff assisting, compared to the many passengers trying to figure out how to use them.

I bought the ticket from China Southern, but I could not check in with them at Incheon Airport and had to go to Korean Air, since they operated the first leg. I could only get two boarding passes for the first 2 legs, and I could not select seats on leg 2 and 3. Other airlines have in the past checked me in all the way from the beginning. All the problems started in Beijing Airport. In order to transfer, I had to get a 72 hour transfer visa and then check in again, even though I had a boarding pass already. When I went to the check in counter, there were no staff there, even though it was 8pm. No one was helping and very few people spoke english. A line started to form, but still no staff. I ended up not being able to change my seat, due to no staff being present. Beijing Airport was terrible, old, dirty and nothing worked. The wifi was a joke, but I was happy when I finally boarded and saw a free wifi sticker next to my inflight entertainment system. I pulled out my iPhone and immediately a flight attendant appeared and told me to shut off my phone. It turned out that all mobile phones have to be shut off during the whole flight. Adding to the general theme of nothing making sense, there was a sticker right next to the free wifi sticker, saying no mobile phones allowed. So you can only use wifi on a tablet. Either way, the wifi didn't even work so you couldn't really do that either. The passengers were mostly Chinese. A fight almost broke out in the queue to the plane, and people were loud throughout most of the flight. In the morning, breakfast was served - I received the saddest omelette with some sort of white sausage next to it. The purser of the plane was friendly though - I had a conversation with her and she seemed really nice. The legroom was not bad for someone who's very tall like me.

My flight to Guangzhou was delayed 4 hours and the airline did not bother to send any flight updates the morning of, even though they knew by 9am that my 2pm flight was going to be delayed. The check-in counter staff were unorganized. My boyfriend asked if we could be upgraded for free to premium economy and they wanted to charge an extra $400 for more leg room. Our 4 hour layover caused us to miss our connecting flight to Phuket in Guangzhou. We were promised by the SFO staff that we would receive a hotel voucher so we could get some rest before our 10pm flight out of China. We arrived in Guangzhou at 2am. No one at Guangzhou airport spoke English and there were only a handful of China Southern employees working that late. After running around the airport for over an hour trying to find customer service to receive our hotel voucher, we were ushered onto a bus at 3am and driven to an undisclosed location to the dirtiest hotel I’ve ever seen. The bus staff refused to tell us where they were taking us, even though it was a 45 minute drive from the airport. We, along with 5 other Americans in the same situation, demanded the bus driver return us to the airport after he refused to let us know when the next shuttle would return. After returning to the airport, I asked staff if it was possible for me to change my flight so I could fly into another city in Thailand and catch a different flight (on a different airline) to Phuket.

I have flown China Southern many times before but my most recent experience has made me decide to never fly with this airline again. Flight delays are common place, with frequently no explanation or apology given by the airline. My most recent example of appalling service by China Southern concerns an incident where my flight from Shanghai to Guangzhou was delayed to the point where I missed my connecting flight to Christchurch. I then spent four hours in a queue attempting to re-book my flight only to be told that there were no seats available and to come back the next day. By this time it was 4:00am. and I had had no sleep. At 9:00am.

After some very forthright conversation they eventually agreed to do it, however, when I got on the flight it was an economy seat that I was given, and this flight was also delayed without explanation. When I finally arrived in New Zealand two days after my original scheduled arrival, I was dropped at Auckland at 2:00am. with no means for me to get to my actual destination of Christchurch 1,000kms away. All attempts to contact China Southern were in vain so I had no choice but to buy a ticket with another airline myself. And when I did eventually manage to contact someone from China Southern two days later, they offered no apology and refused to reimburse me for the extra ticket that I had had to buy.

"""put me off flying with them again""",3,2017-07-06,"✅ Verified Review |  This covers Sydney to Beijing via Shenzhen and Beijing to Sydney via Guangzhou, on two separate return journeys. The first was in March 2017 and the second was outbound in June and return in July. I’ve flown China Southern a few times in the past and been happy, but these two trips were enough to put me off flying with them again if I can possibly avoid it. While most China Southern long-haul flights offer seat-back TVs in economy, this is not available on the Sydney to Shenzhen route. Chinese airlines ban the use of mobile phones, even in in-flight mode. So you can either hope your laptop has eight hours of battery life, or bring a book. International-to-domestic transfer in Shenzhen is shambolic. I’ve done similar transfers, with CZ and other airlines, in other Chinese airports, and it can be slightly chaotic, but Shenzhen is in a different league. After disembarking and going through passport control, passengers are vaguely pointed to a fenced-off area near baggage reclaim with a few chairs, no food and no water. We are told to stay there “for a while” – there is never any indication as to how long that “while” might be, or as to why we might be waiting. On the March flight, it was a little over an hour; on the June flight, it was a little over 90 minutes. Both times, this left me with no time to buy food or drinks in departures before my connecting flight. After the March flight, I found out that we were all made to wait there while Customs – out of sight of us – inspects our checked luggage before it can be transferred to our connecting flights. This was not explained by CZ or airport staff. Passengers for connecting flights are called forward one flight at a time, and are then given vague directions as to where to go next, for a security check before proceeding to departures. On both occasions, I had to translate for bewildered non-Chinese-speaking passengers as announcements (by an ill-tempered lady with a megaphone) were only made in Chinese. Domestic flights are woefully unreliable. While my Shenzhen to Beijing flights were both only an hour or two late, the Beijing-Guangzhou flights were extremely late: by eight hours in March and by six and a half hours in July. At no point until push-back could the FAs or ground staff tell us how long the delay might be. For the July flight, we boarded the plane three hours late, and then sat in the plane at the gate for three and a half hours. On both occasions we were told the delay was due to “weather”. Of course, what that means is that there is a storm, or a potential storm, on the narrow corridor that the military has opened up to commercial operations, and that it is impossible to fly around the storm without leaving that corridor. This makes it practically impossible for domestic airlines to run North to South routes to timetable during the stormy season between March and September. It seems that the only way to get around this is to fly directly from a foreign country East of China to your final destination in China: in future I will try to use Korean, Japanese and Filipino airlines to get to Beijing, or fly directly from Sydney to Shanghai on China Eastern and then make my connection to Beijing by train. It’s a shame. FAs are generally quite helpful, and seat pitch is excellent by economy-class standards.

My only suggestions for improvement would be: Don't allow Economy passengers to use the bathroom in the Premium Economy section. There is a curtain there dividing the two sections. At times Premium passengers were waiting in line to use the bathroom and also behind the curtain so were Economy passengers so it became a little disorganized. If there is a curtain there, it seems the idea is to keep these sections divided? We were given a sandwich that was completely wet, inedible.

"""leaving us stranded in Hefei""",1,2017-06-28,"✅ Verified Review |  My husband and I were flying from Hefei to New York JFK via Guangzhou on China Southern Airlines on June 25. Two days earlier China Southern Airlines sent us a notification through Expedia that the first leg of the flight (Hefei to Guangzhou) was changed to an earlier time: 7:35am instead of the original 10:40am. This would have given us a 10.5 hour wait in Guangzhou instead of the original 7.5 hour wait. When we arrived at the airport, we discovered that all China Southern flights from Hefei to Guangzhou for June 25 were canceled!! China Southern Airlines never informed us that our first flight was canceled, leaving me and my husband stranded at the airport at Hefei. What made it worse is that China Southern Airlines didn't have any representatives or an office at the Hefei Airport. We tried to contact China Southern Airlines on the phone, but none of their customer service phones were operating in English. A couple of our Chinese friends called their customer service in Chinese and were able to speak to an agent, however, the agent didn't find our tickets in the system. At the end we were able to get new tickets on China Eastern Airlines, and were able to get to Guangzhou, and used our original reservation from Guangzhou back home to New York. In Guangzhou they didn't give us any explanation about this situation. China Southern Airlines behavior of canceling our tickets without informing us, and leaving us stranded in Hefei with no way of contacting them and obtaining a way out of there, in my opinion, is fraudulent. I made the ticket reservations a few months before our flight via Expedia, and I attempted multiple times to reserve a vegetarian meal for myself. All of my attempts were unsuccessful.

Just 0.45 mins left to cross two terminals, go through customs, security, passport control, and the mandatory path through duty free, plus finding the gate. CZ had other plans. Since this very plane was earmarked for technical service that night, they didn't bother to offload the passengers at the terminal but instead went for the hangar right away, at the far end of the airport, almost full circling the airport once. Waiting for the bus (15 min). Riding the bus from hangar to far end of terminal 1 (20 min). Crossing Terminal 1 (10 min). Passing the bridge to Terminal 2 (5 min). Crossing Terminal 2 (10 min). Passing Customs, security and passport control (30 min). Walking along closed Duty Free. (5 min) Finding gate. Gate is downstairs, where the regionals are supposed to be boarded. Finding 5 intercontinental boarding lines crisscrossed through 5 regional prop airliner sized gate space. Last persons to arrive. 5 more missing. Waiting, calling out, waiting. Boarding a minibus for the last four of us. Driving at 25 kms/h across the tarmac, past hangars (again) until almost reaching one of the runways, turning right, along full length of cargo area. Full Stop. Finding airplane waiting in the dark at the very far end of the airport, next to the runway threshold. Boarding airplane. Settling in assigned seats. Passenger announcement.

"""disappointed in customer service""",1,2017-06-08,"✅ Verified Review |  Guangzhou to Jakarta. I have been living and working in China for 3 years flying with China Southern every week. My wife is Chinese and she has always booked the flights (over 100) using her Chinese China Southern credit card. The trip from Guangzhou to Jakarta was no different, it was booked in plenty of time using the same method along with several other flights. A week before the flight while travelling elsewhere, I called at the China Southern counter to collect the receipts for the group of flights that had been booked, the Jakarta flight being one of them. A day before the flight I received a missed call from an unknown number. Upon my arrival at Guangzhou airport at 7am I was told that my ticket had been suspended. After a long and complex phone call from the customer services counter to the head office, I either needed to re-book it or get a photo of my wife, holding her Chinese ID and the credit card in front of her face to head office so that they would reinstate my ticket because the transaction had been identified as ""high risk"". Needless to say at 7.30am with 5 minutes until the flight closed this was not possible. I ended up having to buy another ticket, one for the original flight was 7000RMB more expensive than my original flight which cost 1370 RMB. The only option was to buy a ticket for the afternoon flight at 2000 RMB more than my original ticket and get put onto the morning flight. This is what I had to do. China Southern refunded me the cheaper original ticket but would not reimburse me for the extra 2000RMB it cost for the new ticket. They refused to reinstate my ticket despite them having the money, me having a receipt for it, a China Southern Credit card being used, other flights booked at the same time using the same method flown a few days earlier, me Elite loyalty card status and this booking method being used for the last 3 years on well over 100 flights. I wrote numerous emails and eventually ended up speaking to a customer service guy who said they could not refund the more expensive ticket because I had used it! Policy was policy. I asked to speak to his boss and he refused to give me his number or pass me across. To say I am disappointed in their customer service is an understatement, they could not care less about customers.

First CZ advised that they could not check through our luggage to Amsterdam and we must pick up the luggage in Chengdu and then recheck in for next flight. Annoying but there was nothing we could do. After waiting in the lounge in Guangzhou we were told that our flight was cancelled and that they would rebook us on the next flight. The next flight was about 2 hours later which only left 40 minutes connecting time including picking up and checking in our luggage which was insufficient. I had pointed out that there was seats available to Amsterdam via Beijing and so why not rebook us on this. They refused saying this was against company policy and that only if we missed the connection could they rebook us. They promised that there would be on arrival to Chengdu a person to meet us at the gate and guide us to get our baggage and bring us to the next flight. On arrival there was no person to guide us nor was there any screens showing as to the status of our connecting flight. After we picked up our luggage we determined that check for KLM flight was in International Terminal which was about 700 meters away from the domestic terminal where we were. We arrived at the International Terminal and the check in counter was closed. We found an attendant from KLM who was helpful and booked us to Amsterdam via Beijing and onto the flight I had originally asked CZ Guangzhou personnel to book us (CZ0345). We run back to the Domestic Terminal to catch the flight to Beijing. To keep the story short we managed to just catch the flight and on arrival Beijing we went to the business lounge for CZ and found out there was no shower facilities.

Yet another lengthy bus ride to the plane, where we sat for over an hour 'due to air traffic control'; who knows the truth when such statements are made? By chance allocated seats in the premium economy section so plenty of leg room, but no benefit otherwise, though seat not as comfortable as that offered in economy by Qatar (or Gulf) in the A330.

"""service was polite and efficient""",9,2017-05-25,"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Shanghai via Guangzhou. Fantastic value and great service. I needed to fly one-way from Singapore to Shanghai on a trip to visit family staying in more rural China. China Southern was less than half the price of a direct flight to Pudong, plus it landed at Shanghai Hongqiao (a fantastic airport) which connects to the railway station, saving me a 2 hour metro trip across Shanghai. After reading horror stories about China Southern and transiting in Guangzhou, I still decided it was worth it and booked. I am so happy I did. Check-in was as smooth as any airline I've ever flown. Boarding in Singapore was definitely more Chinese than American - I was one of 3 non-Asian people on a sold out flight, so most announcements were in Chinese. Boarding groups were ignored and I followed the crowd and just lined up when everyone else did, but otherwise boarding was very quick. The plane out was a dated A320, but the seats were much wider than what I have flown on recently. As it was an early morning flight, I passed out pretty hard, and awoke four hours later in Guangzhou. A quick note on transiting in Guangzhou to a domestic flight - do it! Passport control, customs, and security were a breeze. Bags are now checked through, so there is no need to collect and re-collect your flight (same for international) plus, if you are going to the domestic terminal, they put you on a small shuttle and drive you over via an indoor bridge. I was off the plane and to my new gate in about 30 minutes. The airport was lovely, and has everything a western one does, including the obligatory Starbucks. 2 hours is more than enough time for a layover, thought three will let you get lunch. My 2nd flight was delayed due to mechanical problems with the B777 we were to fly on. The gate was moved, which was made clear on the electronic reader boards at the gate. Again, announcements were all in Chinese and boarding was more of a get-in-line-first affair, but again it was quick, seats on the A330 were wide, and the meal service (on a 2 hour domestic flight!) was excellent. The crew actually spoke better English than on the SIN-CAN leg. Service was polite and efficient, drinks and food were great, and there was even a bit of IFE on drop down screens. Landing and baggage claim in SHA were super easy, and I was out of the airport in under 20 mins.

The China Southern Airline agent started to scream at me saying 'I already told you this! This is our policy, it's not China Southern Airlines fault that we can't help you!'

Ordering beverages were often accomplished with pointing and hand gestures as asking did not work. I was often handed the wrong item if I attempted to verbally ask. On our long 16+ hour flight, with a connection in Wuhan, there appeared to be no relief for the cabin crew. Due to the flight times, I tried to stay up the entire flight and saw the same faces the entire time. There was no crew change even with the stop in WUH. This lack of relief and long work hours may have explained the curt service provided. I truly felt sorry for the crew. Announcements were often made in Mandarin with a very brief broken English version afterwards. This often left us English speakers confused as to what was happening. After my friend's knee was rammed with the service cart, there was no immediate recognition by crew that something had occurred. Until we called her attention did she stop and look back, realizing the minor injury, then apologized. No snack service in between meals. There were no nuts, chips, cookies, fruits or sandwiches available in the galley in between meal service. We finally had a snack on the short leg between Wuhan to Guangzhou. The seats in economy were fairly tight and uncomfortable. The aircraft wasn't that old but the seats were well worn. I could feel the padding had worn out, leaving me sitting on what felt like metal bars underneath. The aisles were very narrow, often leading to bumped arms and legs from either crew or passengers walking by. The meals, for the most part, were edible and served warm . Unlike other airlines, they do not offer a printed menu, so I had no idea what some of the items were, even after eating it. The passenger next to me was vegetarian but either didn't pre-order the meal or it wasn't available to him. He didn't eat the entire 16+ hour flight as no alternatives were offered to him. Dealing with staff on ticketing issues is very difficult. The agents answering phones often had thick accents and had a hard time understanding me. The emails received were also fairly broken and hard to understand. When one calls during daylight hours in the US, calls are forwarded to China where they have an overnight crew. Once business hours end in the US, you have to call long distance to China. However, they have more staff to assist you then.

Business class lounge in Vancouver (not a China Southern lounge) was excellent, the China Southern business class lounge in Guangzhou airport okay, not great but good enough. We're not regular business class travellers, so lounge still seemed a nice perk. Transfer through Guangzhou was easy. On return, we had a long stopover, and received free night in airport hotel (all classes get free hotel, if layover 8 hrs or more). China Southern agent walked us through immigration, arranging the free 24-hr visa with the Chinese immigration agent (agent also did this for passengers in other classes). Then agent surprised us by walking us all the way to the airport hotel and checking us in (I think this was a business class perk). Amazing service. My only complaint concerned drinks. First, China Southern doesn't seem to understand the idea of a drink before a meal. It took a lot of asking and still we usually ended up with the drink arriving when the meal was placed on our tray. Second, beers were always warm (I gave up on beer), and white wine often warm. Although we were able to get drink refills (sometimes even cool wine), I guess China Southern doesn't really understand how/when to serve alcohol drinks.

"""delightful and helpful cabin crew""",8,2017-01-22,"✅ Verified Review |  This was a return flight from London to Christchurch via Guangzhou. China Southern offers several advantages over other airlines; two checked in 23kg bags and a free hotel if the stopover is more than 8 hours. I found the food on these flights to be quite palatable - some nice fish with rice and a black bean type sauce, an egg & bacon roll for breakfast, out of Christchurch and beef with a slightly spiced sauce and some vegetables, followed by fruit, and an omelette and corn and potato fritter for breakfast, out of Guangzhou. The food and drink selection is not great but I have had much worse on other long haul flights and China Southern's seemingly improved offering is perfectly adequate, and for someone who enjoys Asian type foods. For comparison, my experience of BA's economy class is that their food is far worse (often inedible) on long haul flights. But China Southern serves the worst coffee I've ever had anywhere! On the Guangzhou to London flight an amenity kit was provided in a little navy-blue toilet bag, with toothbrush, comb, eyemask and earplugs, to my surprise. The range of inflight entertainment was not vast, but I found a couple of films I hadn't seen and there was enough to keep me amused. The touch screen was very unresponsive to use on the second flight and my own noise-cancelling headphones didn't seem to work vey well with their system. I found both flights quiet, and the mainly Chinese and Asian passengers were extraordinarily well-behaved and polite, as were the delightful and helpful cabin crew. All the cabin crew I met appeared to speak at least some English. I also heard an announcement that said Chinese laws apply and a general warning that anyone causing trouble could be prosecuted, which I've never heard elsewhere on flights. It might help account for passenger's demeanour. The cabin pressure in 787's really does help stave off jet-lag. I feel almost normal after 2 days back, whereas in the past on other flights to NZ I've suffered for weeks. The real downside of these flights is the terrible seat pitch and the discomfort this causes. I'm 174cm tall and I feel that anyone much taller would suffer considerably. If the person in front of you reclines their seat, you have to recline yours or be squashed with the IFE screen 6 inches from your face. Seat pitch should really be regulated internationally to allow enough legroom for passengers. I found the seat width ok, though the seat was very hard. Being forewarned about that, I took an inflatable seat pad with me, but I was in pain throughout the second flight.

Overall it's good value for business class travellers, with the odd minor annoyance. The 12 hour leg from Auckland to China is generally not full but often the European leg is busier. The quality of cabin service is highly variable depending on English skills and training of staff. One annoying feature is the preferred meal selection are very seldom available, and the remaining meal choice can be quite inedible, and in general insufficient numbers of best meals are allocated (eg China Southern Beef noodle soup, and Al Brown designed meals). This seriously needs sorting out as paying business class flyers should get their choice of meals. Allegedly you can pre book meals on the China Southern website but how many business class travellers have got time to muck around with this, especially when the website is really hard to navigate. The flight connections to and from Auckland are not that great either, with 6 to 8 hour stopover in China which extends the trip substantially. The VIP bus from the plane is a good service, as exiting make sure you follow the hostess carefully to the transit desk area. However, the China Southern International lounge is disappointing (unless you are able to get into the Elite section) as the air-conditioning cannot cope with the heat and humidity, and lounge staff are disinterested in general, and slow to clean the showers and make these available. However, these annoyances aside the business class lie flat seats are damn good and timing reliable so it's simple to get a good sleep and arrive in Europe for business relatively refreshed at 0645 Monday - for half the price of AirNZ business class !

She also asked whether I'd like to be woken for both meals. I had pre-ordered by the website (not easy to do, the CZ website is not easy to negotiate). Meals were both good - probably not as good as other full service carriers in Business, but I was satisfied. Wine selection was fine. Service was speedy for a 2300hrs departure, then off to sleep. Lie flat seat wasn't bad for sleeping, but would have benefited from a small mattress.
