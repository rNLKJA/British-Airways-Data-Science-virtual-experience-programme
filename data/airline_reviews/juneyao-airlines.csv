"""this horrific experience""",2,2021-05-05,"I was scheduled to fly from Huizhou to Shanghai yesterday May 4th at 22:25 on flight number HO1234. The flight was delayed several times and finally cancelled after 00:30 on May 5th. At 1am I was informed by the ground staff that I need to leave the airport as they will be closing and that I will be on a flight to Shanghai at 06:30 but that it is not guaranteed. The ground staff told me that I need to leave the boarding area and that I can go to a hotel since the airport is closing. The hotel they recommended is a very poor and low quality hotel, a hour drive from the airport, which means the return trip would be 2 hours driving, they also said that this would be at my expense. The airline cancels a flight which causes me great inconvenience, spending hours on end at an airport over night where I’m not offered any food or comfort for this horrific experience. I fail to understand how it is deemed fair for me to cover hotel and travel expenses due to the airline cancelling my flight. The ground staff first said that the flight is delayed because of bad weather conditions, although other flights were landing and taking off. The ground staff later said that we had to wait for the aircraft to arrive from Changsha to Huizhou and that there is no telling when it will arrive. I have honestly never experienced such bad customer service in all my years of travelling. No help or resolutions were provided by the ground staff. There was no food in the airport either at this point! I had to sit outside in the cold and wait for the airport to open. At 5am when they opened, I was asked to check in again and board flight number HO123V, to depart at 06:30. At this point I had been at the airport for 11 hours waiting. I got to my destination, Shanghai 8 hours later then scheduled. I have complained about the service received and the experience I have had to go through. The complaint was registered with Trip.com since I made the booking through them. I am a full paying customer and find this treatment unacceptable. I’ve requested compensation or a credit for this poor travel experience and customer service which was denied by Juneyao Airlines according to the Trip.com representative. I am very unhappy and disappointed with this experience, since I have been wronged and inconvenienced and nothing has been done about it. It is unacceptable to treat paying customers in such a manner. I asked the cabin crew on board for a blanket and I was told that there are no blankets since the aircraft had been flying since 12 pm the previous day. At this point I had seen it all, no food, no accommodation, no customer service, no blanket!

There was a 24-hour + overnight stay at the Helsinki airport, for which no accommodations (e.g., blankets and food) were provided, even though the hotel at the airport was closed for transit passengers. For some reason--I had a valid ticket, which I attach to this review--JuneYao had omitted me from the list of passengers to be tested for Covid 19 and its anti-bodies (itself a repeat of tests done in Estonia to obtain a green code from the Chinese government). So, it took a lot of time and effort to convince the airline staff at the Helsinki airport to add me to the list.  Finally, even though I had a boarding pass and two sets of negative test results, the airline delayed boarding me, apparently in retaliation for asking questions.

Since I never wanted any form of frustration at the airport I called them again asking the same questions after two days which they said same. Now on the said date instead of the 32kg excess which was supposed to be 1000rmb was now 4000rmb. I had to drag issues with them until they pulled out the recordings from the previous calls made. They later agreed that I pay the 2000rmb and assured me that I was gonna receive my luggage at my destination. After a successful flight from Shanghai to Bangkok Airport, i was by Egyptair to pay $400 for my excess luggage which has been paid already or else they were going to offload my luggage. I was really worried and had no other option since I was a student returning home and had no money on me.

The airline and its staff take every measure to make one feel comfortable and welcome, especially through the use of (sometimes for European tastes a little over the top) friendly terminology in its announcements. Never have I ever been wished a ""wonderful, magical day ahead"" and thanked for ""the magical journey we have shared together"" - like I said, a little over the top but it did make me feel great. Another first was that the cabin crew went around selling used books for travelers to buy reading material at a cheap price. That culture really spoke to me. The friendly lady even went out of her way rummaging through the box to find an English book to offer me. All combined with lots of genuine smiles. Even the food was delicious. A dedicated security officer made regular patrols through the cabin (although that may be a new requirement on Xinjiang flights) and even he bore a smile and a kind word for everyone. The airplane we flew on was brand new and meticulously clean, in addition, the flight was punctual to the dot. Check-in at SHA had been very uncomplicated and quick, the airline's bag drop counter area was very nicely decorated.

The airport experience was efficient (with the exception of immigration - but that was out of the airline’s hands). Check-in was quick and the service friendly. Boarding began 45 minutes before departure. That process too was fast but there was no organisation to it. There was just an announcement and then the usual surge of people. On board, the crew were fit for purpose. Their English wasn’t brilliant along with their interpersonal skills. There were zero interactions with customers outside of asking a customer what they were eating or drinking. They were rather a surly bunch too - all quite stern looking! The flight departed early and reach Hong Kong some 30 minutes early. So absolutely no complaints about their time-keeping. A hot meal was served on board, with a choice of chicken and rice or beef noodles. In both cases, the quantity of meat was seriously lacking, but the food itself was pleasant. It was served alongside a box containing bread, peanuts, crackers, apple juice and some cutlery. Drinks were complimentary too, although limited to water, tea and coffee. The aircraft wasn’t spotlessly clean. In fact, on boarding, they was an unpleasant aroma of everything. But once the ovens kicked in, it disappeared. The seatbelt too showed some suspicious stains so I used the provided pillow to avoid coming into contact with it. I should point out as well that I found the seat terribly uncomfortable.

She called the lady who serviced the morning flight who claimed to find no lost items of any kinds. Further attempts to trace the aircraft and contact the staff onboard were made but the item was not found. The thing is that I expect from an airline to respect the property of the passengers also after they left the aircraft and not treat it as loot or generic rubbish. I suspect that going through the formalities of reporting found objects can be a hustle to airline workers but what about sense of responsibility and duty to help passengers recover their lost items.

Juneyao Airlines customer review,5,2011-02-19,Ha'erbin - Shanghai Pudong. No aerobridge so waiting in a cold bus with its doors open. Get to the plane and telling everyone to get out of the bus and wait on tarmac to file up the stairs onto the plane. Seats very close together. Seat belt sign on for most of the flight even though it was only minor turbulence. So I could not recline my seat.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Juneyao Airlines customer review,9,2011-01-04,Hongqiao to Qingdao professional and friendly service. Aircraft new staff friendly and speak good English. The only problem I experienced is finding the check-in desk at the Hongqiao airport. Their ticket prices are slightly lower then other domestic airlines.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Juneyao Airlines customer review,6,2010-03-27,Great food and service inflight but both my flight Qingdao to Shanghai and Shanghai to Harbin were delayed an hour or more. The first was assigned to late arrival of the aircraft and the wait was in the terminal. Note that check-in desks are not destination specific for Juneyao at Shanghai Pudong. This means that one cannot arrive after the expected rush (but before check-in closes) and expect a very short or no line since there will likely be a line of people checking in for other destinations at every counter.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Juneyao Airlines customer review,8,2010-01-08,PuDong to Xiamen. Wasn't expecting much based on the inexpensive ticket price from an airline I'd never heard of but was impressed with new plane and upbeat cabin crew. Dinner was a typical tin-foiled beef/chicken with noodles. Drink service was plentiful for such a short flight. Much like Southwest and jetBlue in the US. I love that they fly to both Shanghai airports and have cheap flights even in the afternoon. Overall I'd rate them as an above- average 3 star airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Juneyao Airlines customer review,3,2010-01-07,"Shanghai-Harbin-Shanghai. On the Harbin-Shanghai segment midair the undercover air marshall rudely demanded that I turned off my PDA phone which was already set in ""no connection'. Juneyao should better train their air marshal on manners and be sufficiently knowledgeable about PDA type phones. I am an international frequent traveller and found Juneyao's air marshal manners offensive. Travellers intending to fly Juneyao should make note about using their PDA type phones. Apart from that the air hostess service was good airplane interior was clean.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Juneyao Airlines customer review,8,2009-08-31,TSN-SHA. I have no idea why it's called Juneyao Airlines in English because this is nothing like its Chinese name. Check-in smooth new A320 was spotless inside. Every seat taken. The crew were friendly and helpful free newspapers - I was the only person on the flight with a foreign surname and they'd made a point of ordering in an English-language newspaper for me which was a nice touch. The food was interesting - a tangerine and a dry bread roll (no butter or anything) - but it was inoffensive. Passenger discipline an issue as it is on most domestic Chinese airlines : one stupid woman stood up to get her luggage out the bins when we were still about 100 metres in the air. The crew shouted at her to sit down but she ignored them : she fell over when we hit the ground which was funny.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
