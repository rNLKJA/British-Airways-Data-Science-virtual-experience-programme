Felix Airways customer review,7,2011-04-16,Sharjah via Mukhalla to Socotra and back onboard nearly full Yemeni Bombardier CRJ200 plane. Check in at Sharjah was a bit chaotic due to much luggage boarding the plane was guided by the station manager personally in Sharjah as there wasn't any seat allocation. They have an inflight magazine. During the 2-hour flight to RIY a snack was served. Crew very nice; on the return flight leaving SCT the captain even explained everything what was visible from the windows. The plane was in a good shape at least what was visible - clean and tidy.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True
