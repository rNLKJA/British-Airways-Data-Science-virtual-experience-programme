"""a pleasurable experience""",10,2019-04-10,"Not Verified |  Rarotonga to Aitutaki. The flight with Air Rarotonga was a pleasurable experience: spotless clean aircraft with much space for legs, an excellent and friendly service, coffee was served on that short flight on the small plane and even the small airline's brochure and a daily newspaper was offered to read by passengers. I was impressed by the overall quality of the service.",False,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Rarotonga to Aitutaki,February 2019,5,5,,5,4,,True

A full service was conducted with complimentary tea/coffee/water. Buy on board items offered. Cookies were $2.00 and value for money. The only flight attendant was professional and courteous. the aircraft was immaculate. Seat space rivals some international airline's premium economy offerings. These flights were very pleasant.
