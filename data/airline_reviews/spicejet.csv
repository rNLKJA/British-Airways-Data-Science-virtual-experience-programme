"""recommend you avoid this company""",1,2018-01-31,"We were booked to fly several SpiceJet flights in November 2017. One of these flights was a flight from Delhi to Goa. Shortly over a week before we were due to fly, SpiceJet notified us that the flight was cancelled due to a runway closure. Frustrating of course, but apparently out of their control, so we were initially understanding. What was in SpiceJet’s control however was the customer service experience that followed. To summarise what has been a truly horrendous experience spanning 3 months. SpiceJet could offer no alternative flight that day, so I we had to book an alternative flight at 3 x the price. Due to the cancelled flight being the 2nd leg of a connecting flight SpiceJet calculated the refund of the cancelled leg on an unfair ‘km by km basis’ rather than the price paid for each leg, leaving us out of pocket due to the 2nd leg being much more expensive. SpiceJet erroneously refunded only 1 passenger of the 2 on the cancelled leg, leaving us an additional 7000 INR out of pocket. After querying this we were told the refunded amount was correct and that this was the end of the matter. It took 7 phone calls spanning 3-4 hours, over a period of 5 weeks to receive the refund for the 2nd passenger. Each of these phone calls was to a different agent and involved explaining the situation from the beginning each time and battling the front line denials and scripted replies in order to actually discuss the issue. We were assured on each of these phone calls that the refund had already been processed (it hadn’t) or that it would be processed (it wasn’t). Only after threatening a credit card chargeback and refusing to end a call to a manager before the refund was manually actioned was the owed money refunded to us, more than a month later. From the UK we spent over £50 on phone calls to India to get our own money refunded. In total due to a combination of administrative failures on SpiceJet’s behalf, we are out of pocket approximately 22,000 INR (£250 GBP). After escalating a formal complaint to the top of their complaint channels we received no apology or acknowledgement of failure and were offered a 2,000 INR SpiceJet travel voucher which we refused. All in all, this has single-handedly been the worst customer service experience I have ever encountered with any company, anywhere in the world. SpiceJet may get you from A to B, but if you have to engage with their customer service departments via phone or email for any issues, prepare for a time consuming, fruitless and ultimately incredibly stressful experience.

A member of the ground staff came to the queue and announced all Delhi passengers to leave the queue as the Delhi check-in had been closed - no reason was given.

Even the SpiceJet website would not give up to date information as the delay was owing to incoming flight being diverted to Mumbai. So we decided to stay on airport. The flight was further delayed to 03:30hrs. After an uncomfortably long wait we finally boarded. Everyone was tired and the cabin lights were dimmed after take-off. I thought I should use the washroom before settling down. To my horror I found there was no soap or hand towels. When I asked the cabin crew they said ""sorry madam, it is finished.

The captain was prompt enough to explain the reason for the delay hence there was no confusion. Clean aircraft with attentive cabin crew. Return flight at night was delayed 2 hours but was informed about the same in the afternoon through a text message which I think is a positive step. The flight to Chennai was operated by an all women crew which I think is a first as far as the low cost airlines in India are concerned. Overall good experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
SpiceJet customer review,,2013-03-13,Very bad customer service. Flight delayed 30 mins initially then 1 hour 2 hours 3 hours and it went on and on. The cancellation was not allowed by the customer service because apparently their systems were not update with the reality on the airport. Stranded at Chennai airport for 8 hours and tried to change it but was disregarded by the staff. Being economical does not mean that you start ignoring passengers who are asking you legible valid questions as and when you feel like.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,1,,False,
SpiceJet customer review,8,2013-02-18,BOM-CCU-BOM. The flights were on-time each way. Cabin crew were warm and friendly. Have travelled Spicejet earlier as well and was impressed to see the improvements they have made over the years. The only issue I had was on my BOM-CCU flight where the leg space was inadequate. However the flight from CCU-BOM was excellent.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
SpiceJet customer review,4,2013-01-24,21-01-2013 BOM-COK Boeing 737. The check-in procedure was quite disorganised with the longest possible line for any airline I could see at Bombay. Their website says you cannot do web check-in if you need to check in baggage. For an early morning flight this rule makes you leave home at least half an hour before other airlines. Staff allotted me an aisle seat in the non-reclining row before exit without informing me since I am relatively tall the leg space was quite insufficient the only reason to be thankful was the gentleman in front of me did not recline his seat. Overall have had better experiences on other Indian budget airlines like Indigo. Staff are good but could do with some more training. Would I fly this airline again - perhaps but the price will need to be good to consider this alternative.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,3,,False,
SpiceJet customer review,9,2012-12-20,Mumbai to Goa and back. Good airline which was on time. Food to buy on board. Free checked luggage allowance.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,5,,True,
SpiceJet customer review,10,2012-12-20,Colombo (CMB) to Chennai (MAA). Aircraft used was Bombardier Q400 with a flying time of around 1 hrs 40 mins. The aircraft was clean and new. Check-in and boarding was smooth and efficient. Very comfortable flight. Overall a good experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,3,,,5,,True,
SpiceJet customer review,8,2012-12-13,Goa to Hyderabad on a Bombardier. Nice aircraft. Flight was delayed but we were informed a few days prior. Overall good experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,,,3,,True,
SpiceJet customer review,6,2012-11-22,Less than 24 hours after I booked my ticket online I got a text message letting me know that the flight time had changed by 30 minutes. On the way to the airport I got another text message letting me know that my flight would be delayed by 30 minutes. I got to the airport and was told the delay would now be an hour. One hour later after the original departure time the plane didn't show up for another 30 minutes. The plane was small but clean and looked new. Bottled water was handed to everybody. Overall the flight was pleasant but the delays make the trip exhausting for I spent more than 4 hours at the airport. Also while it was nice they sent a text message it would have been nice if they sent an email. I'm not an Indian resident but got a local phone and realized I wouldn't have known about the flight changes if I didn't have a local phone.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,3,,True,
SpiceJet customer review,8,2012-10-23,MAA-TRV. Chennai Airport looks like it needs replacing and the security queue snaked around the terminal building. The flight was late boarding mainly because the domestic terminal only had two gates in use. Aircraft was a modern Bombardier Q400 which was two thirds empty. The wrong aircraft safety card was in my seat pocket I showed this to one of the crew and she replaced it. Cabin Crew were attentive and efficient in their tasks. Flight arrived 30 minutes late into Trivandrum and the bags took about 15 minutes to come out.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,4,,True,
SpiceJet customer review,7,2012-09-30,Flew Bombay to Kochi on Spicejet. Early morning departure and a full plane. My partner and I got seats in the last row - uncomfortable and cramped for the 2 hour flight but a full flight so no chance of changing seats. Poor service on board with terrible crew. Got to Kochi only to be told the return flight was cancelled on our date of return. Called their Customer service and were rebooked very efficiently on another flight- and even to a new destination as we had missed a connection. Flight back much better. Service great. Was like flying 2 different airlines.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SpiceJet customer review,1,2012-09-11,We were flying to Trivandrum from Chennai. The journey takes about one hour fifteen minutes. The flight was announced and we boarded at 6.30 pm and were supposed to take off at 7 pm. No announcement till 7.15 pm. When passengers approached the cabin crew they did not know what was happening. The flight crew was arguing with the ground staff. There was nothing to eat or drink. The pilot announced that there will be some refreshments but nothing came. Finally after an hour and half the flight took off. We reached Trivandrum around 9.30 pm. The experience was awful. If there was an issue the airlines should have delayed the flight instead of boarding passengers and make them wait on the Tarmac without any option of cancelling the journey or even getting refreshments. We never did the mistake of taking a Spicejet flight again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
SpiceJet customer review,2,2012-06-27,This is a low fare airlines that appeals to many budget minded travelers. However the airlines baggage policy is completely out of line with the international standards. For example most international carriers offers checked-in luggage up to 23 Kg while SpiceJet is only 20 Kg. The carry-in is limited to 7 Kg only. When you check in your luggage after arriving from overseas journey SpiceJet charges 200 Rupees per Kg an extraordinarily high rate. Checking-in Staff are eager to charge and seldom give a consideration to a traveler's appeal. One feels trapped as there is no option. My advice to SpiceJet increase the weight limit to 23 Kg and institute a flat fee in Indian Rupees equivalent to $25 dollars for an extra piece of checked-in luggage not the 200 Rupees per Kg rate. My advice to international travelers do not expect any concession from ground staff; most of them are trigger-happy to charge fees for extra weight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
SpiceJet customer review,9,2012-02-17,On time departure from BLR and 30 mins early into Kolkata. Relatively old aircraft but well maintained. Quality of food served was good.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SpiceJet customer review,5,2011-09-10,DEL-KTM-DEL on a relatively old B737-800. Nothing much is expected from a LCC but the worst part was the leg room and space. As we were travelling with our 6 month old child we barely moved for the entire 1.5 hrs flight due to limited space. Barring this everything else went fine. FA were courteous and helpful.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SpiceJet customer review,4,2011-08-03,BLR-DEL. Smooth check in friendly ground crew. We were flying their 737-900 aircraft. Poor seat pitch. I'm 5'11 and my knees kept knocking the seat in front. Agreed Economy airlines offer bad legroom but this was hopeless. Luckily I was the only person in my row and could get some extra room by reclining the middle seat. Food is not free as with most budget carriers rates are good.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
SpiceJet customer review,,2011-07-22,SpiceJet from Hyderabad-Delhi. My sister had booked a ticket for me using an international credit card but when she realised the ticket should be booked using Indian credit card if the ticket owner is not travelling she managed to get an Indian credit card from her friend and called customer care of SpiceJet and made the payment using the Indian credit card. When I reached check-in I was told I can't board the flight because payment had been made using a credit card of someone else. They didn't listen to me we had checked 4-5 times with the airline when making the payment that this would be okay. I was harassed by the staff and they asked me to pay the money in cash. Finally they took cash and asked me to sign a declaration and only then could I board the flight. When I reached home and called their customer care they just said sorry it's our system's fault.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
SpiceJet customer review,6,2011-02-28,Pune to Delhi return. The outbound was delayed and so my 11am departure became a 3pm departure. They kept messaging us the delayed time but does not help when you have appointments you are missing. The ground staff in Pune had no empathy and we got not even a hint of an apology for the delay. Cabin crew nicer - friendly attitude and good service. Return delayed as well by one hour. Check in staff in Delhi no better. The only reason I would not recommend this airline is that every flight on both days seemed to be running late.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
SpiceJet customer review,10,2011-02-22,Jaipur to Kochi via Mumbai. Clean aircraft friendly crew a bottle of water free small offering of food an drinks to a fair price. I was surprised of the product quality. The new domestic terminal in Mumbai is clean and has quiet corners to relax.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SpiceJet customer review,8,2011-02-11,BLR-DEL-BLR because their price was very attractive. The meal price is reasonable and meal was good. Seats okay service fine. The return flight was delayed for an hour however the crew was apologetic.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SpiceJet customer review,9,2011-02-11,Delhi-Kolkata return on 737-800. The check-in at Delhi was fast and staff polite and helpful. The departure was on time and plane was spotless. Seats were allocated there were no charges for checked luggage and a bottle of water was given to each passenger. In row 11 the seat pitch was fairly tight but only a problem when the person in front reclined her seat. Check- in at Kolkata was OK but travellers should be aware that you go to have all your luggage scanned before going to the check-in desks.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SpiceJet customer review,8,2010-07-24,Cochin to Mumbai. I As it is a low-fare airline you have to buy food or drinks onboard but prices seem reasonable. The plane seemed clean. It was an uneventful flight quite different from the glamor flying with Kingfisher. But for the money we spent it was a worth the value.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SpiceJet customer review,,2010-06-02,Delhi to Chennai. 3 hour delay due to dodgy plane. New plane had 18 fewer seats but we still try and fit everyone on. 3 adults and 2 kids per row. Don't start the air conditioner for an hour as you sit on the tarmac in 45 degree heat. Almost mutiny everyone standing up and waving their arms around. No food and the least leg room I've ever seen on a flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
SpiceJet customer review,7,2010-03-15,Pune to Delhi return flight. Convenient timings with a 9am arrival in Delhi. Smooth check in and service on flight satisfactory. Return again convenient with a late evening flight arriving at 2300. Full flights both ways so aircraft crowded and the leg room in the seats are so limited that you feel crammed in for the flight. Fare similar to others but as its non stop it pips Indigo airlines on this route.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
SpiceJet customer review,,2010-02-02,We booked our tickets on Spicejet with a travel agent in Surat on August 2009 for travel January 2010 for Goa to Mumbai flight in the afternoon so some of us can catch a flight back to US from Mumbai that night. As we were standing in line at Goa airport for more than an hour they took down the Mumbai sign at the check in counter. On inquiry the check in person told us the flight was cancelled and the fare will be refunded to the travel agent- no other assistance or help. We had to scramble to GoAir counter to get to Mumbai before we are no show at the international flight. GoAir charged us INR 45951 for 7 tickets to Mumbai. Spicejet is irresponsible in its policies and attitude. They left 200+ international passengers in limbo at a place without accomodation or any other help. In light of our experience I would advise anyone with any plans for further travel to stay away from booking their tickets on Spicejet unless they want to jeopardize their plans and wallet!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
SpiceJet customer review,4,2009-12-28,Keenly priced tickets. They take a practical view of baggage allowances which is very helpful. Overhead lockers are somewhat low and can be awkward for odd-shaped carry-on bags. FAs are very courteous. Seat pitch is unsatisfactory but for short flights this may not pose a problem.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
SpiceJet customer review,2,2009-11-23,CJB - DEL (via HYD). Departure punctual arrival late due to endless approach into Delhi. Whilst you get what you pay for in terms of service on this type of airline I was surprised at the rudeness of the CC. When on the ground in HYD one of them addressed me as if I was an inmate in a prison camp for wishing to use the toilet. However in the air with turbulence warning and seat belt signs on pax were walking up and down to the toilet freely.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
SpiceJet customer review,4,2009-05-17,Mumbai-Delhi check-in did not take very long. Seats were pre-assigned as the flight was full 20 mins delay departing. B737-800 cabin clean. Seat pitch very tight. Food for purchase was a good selection of snacks and beverage ie. sandwiches cookies muffins tea coffeeetc. Cabin crew disappeared after food sale and only returned to collect the trash. Overall a good experience except for the very tight seat the price was extremely competitive.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
SpiceJet customer review,2,2008-11-07,BOM-DEL and IXB-KOL. Both flights were heavily delayed. Was the worst Indian airline in terms of punctuality and service. Also they seem to get the furthest possible bays which means taking almost an hour from the plane to the airport after landing. I would not fly with them again.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
SpiceJet customer review,4,2008-07-29,Delhi to Srinagar via Jammu. The time of my web-booked flight had changed but I had not been notified of this and therefore arrived at the airport far too early. Luckily there was an earlier flight and the person at the ticket counter changed my booking to this flight at no extra cost. Seats were allocated at check in but there was no scramble anyway as there were only 100 passengers. The 737-800 was clean and the crew were quite friendly. Overall a positive experience - but Spicejet have already started cutting routes and frequencies so things are looking tough for the Indian locos.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
SpiceJet customer review,4,2008-05-23,Pune to Chennai return. Flown for the first time with them and found them okay. Planes were new and clean. Both flights were on time. FAs well groomed and do a good job. Food served was not free and was more of a snack. For the fare they charge you its a very good airline to fly with in India.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
SpiceJet customer review,4,2008-03-30,DEL-CJB (via HYD). We chose this flight for its convenient timing. SpiceJet's ticket office at Delhi Airport is very hard to find (as an exception to the rule it's located outside the temporary ticketing hall). Check-in friendly and efficient. Boarding via a bus with a ridiculously high step. Flight left on time meaning we actually lifted off the runway at the scheduled time of 1710 (a miracle given today's crowded Indian airports). Onboard catering limited and expensive. On the second leg (HYD-CJB) there were two incidents of altercations between cabin crew and pax mainly over the issue of the complimentary water bottles not being provided (ostensibly because of turbulence preventing service although the seatbelt signs were NOT on) yet the FAs were happy to serve anyone who wanted to purchase any food or beverages. These two unpleasant situations were not handled well by what came across as a particularly arrogant FA. Landed in CJB on time.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
SpiceJet customer review,3,2007-12-23,PNQ-HYD. I booked with a foreign credit card which caused a bit of a delay at check-in. All boarding at Pune is done via remote stands though it was done quite efficiently and we actually pushed back 5 minutes early. The plane was a B737-800 and it was clean and well-maintained. The FAs were efficient and friendly. There's no IFE at all but since the flight time was only 1 hour it wasn't a big deal. Main complaint was the seat pitch which seemed a bit tight though it was manageable for a 1 hour flight. Being an LCC you had to pay for everything on board except for water but the prices are reasonable - 20 rupees (about 50 cents) for juice and 60 rupees (about $1.50) for a sandwich. You also have to pay to pre-reserve a seat online but again the cost is negligible at 50 rupees (about $1.25). If you are booking online also beware that you will be offered trip insurance after you select your flights and the default is set to yes so pay attention before finalizing your purchase. The flight arrived at HYD about 5 minutes early and although my bag was the last on the carousel it only took about 10 minutes to appear. Overall a good value for the price I paid at about $52 for an advance purchase one-way ticket.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
SpiceJet customer review,4,2007-10-04,AMD-HYD return quite happy with the product. New B737-800. Were offered soft drinks & peanuts on a 1 hr 15 min. flight. FAs attentive and efficient. On-time performance both ways. Can't really fault the offering. I'd rate it as above average LCC experience.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
SpiceJet customer review,4,2007-05-16,DEL-BOM-DEL. A good and cheap budget carrier. New spotless aircraft friendly service and flights were in time. I have no complaints at all except the horrible Delhi airport but that is not the fault of Spicejet. Everything about Spicejet reminded me of Easyjet if compared to an European low-cost airline.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
