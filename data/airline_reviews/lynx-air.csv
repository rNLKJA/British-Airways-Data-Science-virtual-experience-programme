"""It is such a bad service""",5,2022-11-11,Trying this new Lynx Airline. It only started operational this April. Book and fairly cheap flight to Vancouver. Moment got the gate. I was right away ask for payment of my personal item as a carry on baggage. Although my bag is not that big compare to some of passengers of bulky backpack. My personal baggage was a small bag that fits underneath the chair and no need to put in the overhead bin. It is such a bad service and from gate crew giving bad attitude and not even polite to customers. Paying $41.99 carry-on fee that should have been free as personal item. I understand to pay a carry-on if my item is too bulky and big backpack. I have posted a photo of how it looks like under the seat putting my small bag not bulky compare to other big backpacks. I even saw other passenger didn't have to pay extra charge of $41.99 even their personal item is much bigger than mine.

"""rather curt with the customers""",7,2022-08-12,"This was my first flight with Lynx, and in some ways it exceeded my expectations; the online check-in and check-in at the airport were smooth, and the seat was as comfortable as I’ve come to expect on domestic flights from the other airlines. However, the following areas were not so pleasant:  They changed the departure time, making in 90 minutes earlier than original, and did not notify me by email or text. I only found this when I was checking in for the flight. Fortunately, we were able to modify our plans to travel to the airport with family, but if I had already booked an airport shuttle, this could have been a problem. They should let you know much earlier than that by the usual means when they change the departure time. They also changed the departure gate at the last minute at Toronto airport. In the final analysis, the flight came in late, and we departed over an hour later than the newly scheduled time anyway. One of the ground staff at the gate was very curt in how she dealt with the people lining up to get on the flight. We all know the drill - handicapped and elderly and those with children go first. However, my wife is 70 years old, had recently suffered a head injury and concussion, and was somewhat wobbly on her feet. She didn’t ‘look’ infirm; I.e. she didn’t have a cane or wheelchair, but as I was trying to explain her condition to this staff person and ask if we could board early, she wouldn’t even hear me out, but was barking orders at us and others to get out of the way for those with children. I protested, but moved out of the way. Later, she again barked at us to come and she allowed us to board early. We appreciated it, but her manner in both cases was not suitable for someone dealing with the passengers. The other gate staff, a couple of young women, were very pleasant to speak with.  The flight attendant (male) was rather curt with the customers as we were boarding. He kept calling out “All backpack and personal items WILL be put under the seat in front of you.” He repeated this frequently as people boarded, never varying the wording. Felt like he was barking orders to the crowd. My wife and I were both in aisle seats, and the space under the seat in front of us was narrower than the width of a seat. Thus, our backpacks wouldn’t fit in them. He made my wife jam her backpack into the space anyway. Fortunately, the centre seat beside me was empty, and I could put mine there, because there was no way it was going to fit under the seat in front of me without being damaged. Meanwhile, there were empty spaces in the luggage bins right above our heads. I would suggest: The flight staff should phrase such directives as a request, like, “Please place your backpacks under the seat in front of you.”. That way it comes across as a request, not a barked order. A little common sense: If the space underneath is too narrow, place the item in the obviously empty spaces above rather than jamming it under and risking damaging the bag and its contents.

"""if you keep this nonsense up, no one will want to fly with you""",1,2022-07-19,"Worst service I have ever encountered. I've flown many airlines, through many routes, with different types of service, etc. But this one takes the cake for probably the worst airline I have ever flown. Let's start from the beginning, shall we? I was originally booked for the Toronto to Edmonton flight that was set to depart around 11.30pm local time on July 17, 2022. But lo and behold the flight is cancelled. The email was sent the day before the flight saying the flight is not ""available"" whatever that means. Call customer service, sit there for 40 mins, eventually get someone to answer my call, turns out I can't rebook with another route other than the original one. So, I was pretty much stuck and had to book on my own terms. Funny thing is, the airport websites, every other website, says the flight is still scheduled, so whoever is doing the updating, needs to be fired or retrained because the amount of confusion and stress that it caused all of us is unreal. I asked them to book me another route, but I'm told they cannot. Thank you, Lynx, for the amazing service. Really. The icing on the cake. I rebook through Lynx from Hamilton to Calgary on Y9 508. set to depart at 10.05pm local time, the flight is delayed, five times. The flight only left Hamilton for Halifax at 8.30pm, and we're set to leave in an hour and a half. When the flight finally arrives, it's almost 2am. We board, and we're stuck on the airplane even longer, and we're delayed even more until it's almost 4am when we finally take-off. Everyone looked so exhausted, they couldn't be angry even if they wanted to. So, on behalf of everyone on Y9 508 on July 17, 2022, complain as much a possible about this airline and get as much compensation as you possibly can, because this is completely unacceptable. Dear Lynx, you should be ashamed to call yourselves a ""leading"" low cost airline. If you want pointers, look to JetBlue, Southwest, and Swoop, if you can't understand the meaning of quality service, don't be in this industry!

Great price. I was staying overnight so booked a hotel. Firstly my departing flight time was changed which was annoying but acceptable. I never received any more emails from them so assumed all was well. Until I tried to check in online yesterday. Took a long time to get to the check in screen and when I finally did I saw that my flight for today had been changed to tomorrow with the return flight the same day a few hours later. No use for the business I needed to do in Calgary. As it had taken so long to check in online and learn about the change I was too late to cancel my hotel booking so now I have to pay for an unused hotel room as well as the flight. If I ‘cancel’ the flight it warned of a charge to do this so I am reluctant to incur any more charges. I tried to change the flight dates but wasn’t able to do that either. I haven’t tried calling them. Didn’t know how to find a phone number. I am so disappointed and disgusted with this service and agree with the other reviewers who say don’t use this airline.
