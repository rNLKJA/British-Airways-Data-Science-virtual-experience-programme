"""a satisfactory experience""",7,2019-10-23,"Omsk to Krasnoyarsk. I was a little unsure as to what to expect from a second tier Russian company. However, the check in process was quick and efficient, although it was done only in Russian and I had to move a little weight from my checked in luggage to my hand luggage. The flight departed and arrived on time. The plane was quite small but legroom was still adequate. It was subject to turbulence as we were approaching the landing. The cabin crew appeared not to speak English as announcements were only in Russian. A good snack was served on the almost two hour long flight. My luggage came off the flight fairly quickly. All in all a satisfactory experience.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Omsk to Krasnoyarsk,September 2019,3,3,,5,5,,True
