Ground procedures in Domodedovo were rather slow but this is not an airline's fail. On-board experience was great - I was lucky to get modern aircraft because Belavia still operates some ancient Boeing 737 Classic but this time it was a new B738 instead. Cabin crew were awesome. There was even a meal service (ham/cheese sandwiches) despite the flight is just 1h long. What was rather disappointing - bussing to terminal instead of jet bridge both in DME and MSQ. Maybe they have a reason for this, but in both airports I saw a lot of vacant jet bridges. Also - cabin was very cramped like in low-cost carriers. Possibly they are managing to cut costs in such a way.

Crew assumes everyone is Belarussian, which is not very thoughtful. Drinks are fine, but the food was absolute horror. They said it was beef but I was unable to identify what kind of stuff I got.
