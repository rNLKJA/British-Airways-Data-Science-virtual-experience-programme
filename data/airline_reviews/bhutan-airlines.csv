"""waiting two years for the refund""",1,2022-07-17,"Terrible. We are waiting two years for the refund of a Paro-Kathmandu flight purchased in 2020 (flight number: B3771). We could not travel to Bhutan in 2020 and it’s still impossible now to enter in the country (2022). First, they told us that the flight would be valid for another year. But, as in 2021 it was still not possible to travel there, we requested a refund. Since that moment, (more than a year ago), We have sent twenty emails and they do no answer. An incredible behavior of this company to its customers. We are still waiting for an answer. If it happens, we will communicate it. We have sent all the information twenty times to have our legal refund. But They have not answered yet. For the moment, We do not recommend this company to anyone. Be very careful if you buy flight tickets with them.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paro to Katmandu,August 2021,,,,,1,,False
"""good things to say""",10,2019-03-27,"Kolkata to Bangkok. I have nothing but good things to say about Bhutan Airlines. They're a great ambassador for their country, even though I never set foot in Bhutan. I flew from Kolkata to Bangkok on an Airbus 319 in Economy bulkhead. Surprisingly, I had the row to myself. The plane was clean and colorful, decked out in Bhutanese red and gold in the interior, and the crew were in traditional Bhutanese outfits as well. Seats were comfortable, we were on time, and the flight was only about half full. There was a meal on this short hop featuring Bhutanese cuisine and it was truly outstanding--one of the best economy class meals I've had in years. Even the inflight magazine was superb, highlighting not just places to see and things to do in Bhutan, as well as spotlighting some of the more unusual aspects of their culture, such as women taking multiple husbands. Bottom line, it was not just a great transport experience (on time, hassle free) but an educational experience about their home country as well. I can't wait to take them all the way to Bhutan.",True,A319,Business,Economy Class,Kolkata to Bangkok,January 2019,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",3,5,,True
"""Bhutan experience turned bad""",1,2016-07-25,"✅ Verified Review |  Today, I am flying out of Paro via Kolkata to Bangkok with another connecting flight 3 hours after landing with Bhutan airlines. Their flight is delayed by at least two hours without passengers being informed properly. No signboards, no announcements. Also as they know my connecting flight I did not get pro-actively informed. Asking myself and going up to the station manager no real support is offered, no reliable forecast for landing time in Bangkok is given. I have to short term re-book my connecting flight from Bangkok to Singapore. No responsibility taken for extra cost, a hotel in Bangkok or other additional expenses. Their excuse is weather in Kalkuta not allowing their plane to come to Paro. A wonderful Bhutan experience turned bad!",False,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,PBH to BKK via CCU,July 2016,2,2,,1,1,,False
Bhutan Airlines customer review,10,2015-02-18,Flew Bangkok to Paro round-trip both flights via Calcutta. Outbound I was in Economy Plus and the legroom was excellent. The breakfast was well served hot and tasty-far more substantial that is offered on many other carriers. On the return I was upgraded to business and the leather seat was roomy and comfortable. The meal (lunch) was good but the performance of the crew was truly world-class. I have to say that I was very impressed by the professionalism and demeanour they displayed. In business one is given access to priority clearance in Bangkok which worked well but still a long wait for baggage-though mine was the first bag out. Excellent offering overall.,False,,,Business Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True
Bhutan Airlines customer review,10,2014-05-23,PBH-CCU CCU-PBH Y class. Check in staff at Paro very helpful friendly smiling. Cabin crew similarly accommodating and friendly. Clean cabin decent space for Y class. Light refreshments and sandwiches (veg or non-veg) served on this short 50-minute segment. Every flight has been spot on time (or slightly early). Good announcements from cockpit to point out Himalayan peaks when near Paro. Competitive prices. A good alternative in/out of Bhutan from Drukair.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True
