"""cannot provide a consistently reliable service""",1,2022-06-21,"The only thing consistent about Airnorth is their inconsistency! I live in a town where it’s our only choice of airline so we have to continually endure rescheduled flights (I’m not talking about minutes behind, I mean hours and hours) You are forever missing connecting flights, losing money on motel rooms, rentals etc. Their pricing is typical of an airline who has a monopoly on a service, and I can live with that, but it’s the simple fact that they cannot provide a consistently reliable service for the money they get that infuriates me. And only providing a tiny bottle of water and a packet of cheese and crackers as in flight catering is poor.

The last time I flew with a different airline, I remember waiting ages for drink service that only came around once and paying something ridiculous for a small snack. But Air North blew that experience out of the water! Complimentary food and drinks are one thing, but this was only a 2.5 hour flight and they kept us busy the whole time serving drinks, a lovely sandwich, a cookie, and then more drinks. I was positively full at the end of the flight. And when I complimented the cookies (oatmeal chocolate chip served warm!) the very lovely stewardess, Keely, got me and my sister (my travelling companion) a few for the road!!

Onward flights to Perth with QF uneventful.

"""was pleasantly surprised""",7,2016-04-18,"✅ Verified Review |  Airnorth (Australian Airnorth that is) code-sharing with QantasLink has recently commenced a mostly daily non-stop service from the almost new Toowoomba-Wellcamp Airport to Melbourne (and also does a Toowoomba-Cairns run as well). I thought I'd give it a try for a business trip and was pleasantly surprised. Check-in is nicely efficient through the QantasLink staff, seating and also inflight service is pleasant except for the very annoying practice of loudly announcing the facilities etc on-board immediately after the aircraft has lifted off making for a very nerve racking experience - and I am a very frequent flyer who is never nervous. Forget the charm and excitement of the take-off experience. Why do some airlines do this these days? I had the same awful experience on a recent British Airways flight from Dubai to London. What a crazy idea. Also it is worth noting that Airnorth use Terminal 4 at Melbourne so don't make the mistake of thinking you can make a quick connection to regular Qantas or Qantaslink flights in Melbourne as these are in another terminal and quite a long walk awaits you from the Airnorth aircraft arrival gate across to the Qantas Terminal. The Qantas web-site and booking system does not seem to get that (yet).

Airnorth customer review,6,2015-03-04,Had another wonderful flight from Whitehorse to Vancouver. Disappointed that's had to transit via Kelowna however. Makes a relatively short flight into a long one. I was also very disappointed in the agent boarding the aircraft. Very rude and poorly trained.

Airnorth customer review,5,2014-07-15,I have to put in some severe criticism of Airnorth's customer service during the ash cloud disruption in June. My original morning flight on Sat 31 May Dili-Darwin was cancelled - fair enough. Airport staff thought it might operate in the afternoon and sent us home. The call centre told about midday that they hadn't decided what to do yet but would contact everyone later. About 3pm I got a call from the Qantas call centre to reschedule connecting flights and they saw in the system that Airnorth had rebooked me for 5pm Sunday. Then on Sunday morning I looked at Airnorth's website and it said that my 5pm flight had been changed to 12.45pm so I rushed off to the airport. It turned that was wrong and we were sent home. The call centre isn't open on Sundays so I had no idea what was happening. Eventually I saw on Darwin airport's website that the incoming fight had been cancelled (all other airlines operated normally from Dili and Darwin that afternoon). Airnorth eventually called at 7pm to tell me I was rescheduled for 5pm Monday. Normally Airnorth flights have been fine - on time good staff limited food but only short flights anyway. However they really can't handle anything unusual and given their monopoly on many routes they probably won't bother to improve.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,False

Airnorth customer review,6,2014-04-27,DWN-TSV then GCA-DWN - April 2014. Flight down was direct on time and with good inflight service. Return flight via MT ISA less pleasing mainly because the FA's jammed us all together despite a number of rows of empty seats at the front of the plane. I hate having to ask to move once seated and with carry on in the o/head lockers. There was no need (that I can see) to stack us that way and it just left a bad taste in the mouth. Food on the return flights was similarly 'bad' in the mouth. 1st leg was a beef curry (very boarding school type muck) and 2nd leg described as a chicken wrap which turned out to be a beef wrap. Too bad if you were allergic and took a bite (surprise!).,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,True
Airnorth customer review,2,2014-04-19,TSV-DRW-TSV: We chose to fly with Air North because of good connection flight times when returning from our overseas holiday. We arrived in Darwin at 4.50am after being in transit for 12 hrs from an overseas destination we were scheduled to fly back to Townsville on the 7.00am flight which was perfect. Air North changed the flight schedule our new departure time was 1.45pm. An increased wait of 6.45 hours at Darwin airport. I contacted Air North and inquired if any assistance could be given to us meal voucher half day accommodation etc. I received an email from the Marketing and Communications Manager who sighted their rules of carriage and provided us with details of a local motel for us to contact no assistance was offered not even a coffee voucher!
