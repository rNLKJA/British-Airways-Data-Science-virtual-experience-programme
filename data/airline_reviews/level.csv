The food carts appeared out of nowhere bringing wonderful wafting smells. There was chatter as to what might be on the menu. Then the servers only served a scattering of folks who had paid and pre-ordered. The rest of us could ante-up for the extra supply kept on hand, but either way many on the 8-hour flight would go hungry. Then the drink cart came and I thought to console myself with a cranberry juice or a coca-cola, and those cost extra, too.  I was not offered water, but when I asked for some the steward rearranged the bright products on his cart and came up with a small paper cup and voilá, I had my gulp of complimentary water.

The Level manager on shift was verbally hostile and offered no resolution, no way of communicating with Iberia to look into flight change or other solutions, and no alternative options. Only the window clerk offered sheepishly a personal suggestion and gave me a phone number to contact Iberia. When my cell phone had connectivity issues in that particular part of the airport, I was informed that Level had no phone line I could use instead to speak with Iberia. I had to borrow a cell phone from another passenger to call Iberia! Then, I was told the only option was to change my flight, which the Level staff could not do with their laptops, so for that, the Level manager had to enter a note in the system confirming I had shown up for check-in. By that time, the manager had left for the gate (before even all passengers had checked in; in other words, check-in and boarding functions overlap in time and only 1 manager covers both). The check-in clerk tried to enter a note in the computer system (despite not having the credentials for that type of annotation in the system), but that did not get registered on the Iberia end.

We originally bought the tickets in February, and our new itinerary was finally confirmed just days before our departure - the 3rd week in April. The actual flight was more or less uneventful, but you need to be aware that you have to pay for everything - checking in a bag, a meal, even water is not free. In fact, while we were checking in on-line we were told over the phone that there are a limited number of free random seats and we will have to pay for a seat. I said, ""forget it, we'll stand."" She was not amused and said we will have to pay for our seats.  Level flights depart from Newark at 10:40pm to go to Paris. However, exceptionally (it was never explained why the time change) our return flight on May 3rd would leave at 00.20. On May 3rd, we arrived at Newark at 9pm. Much to our surprise, Level had no scheduled flight that night, no agents were anywhere to be found and the customer service number was not available at that time. In the meantime we had to spend hundreds of euros to extend our stay in New York. We had to wait until 3AM to reach a customer service representative to find out what was going on. We were informed that we were supposed to check in on the evening of May 2nd to fly out at 00.20 (which is May 3rd).  The only solution they offered were to reimburse the tax - the first supervisor told us it was 230 euros, but the second supervisor said it would only be 75 euros). When we demanded to speak to another supervisor we were told that there weren't any other supervisors at this time that spoke English, only Catalan. An agent got on the phone and spoke Spanish. We explained the  situation, he apologized (the only agent to apologize) and said he would need 72 hours to rectify the situation. In the meantime the supervisor invited us to purchase new tickets to fly out a couple of days later for $1900 (for 2 adults / 1 child) with the hopes of getting reimbursed.",True,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris Orly to Newark,May 2019,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",3,1,,,False

This was all at 1:00 in the morning. After another hour, we were told that the flight was cancelled and we would receive an email about our options.

When I arrived at the airline counter at EWR 3 hours before my flight departure, the ticketing agent received an error message on her computer resulting to her not being able to print my luggage tag & an actual boarding pass. The check-in agent then proceeded to verify that my passport is still valid, that my tickets were valid, that I was cleared to fly by the border control & airport security both in USA and France and I was not in the no-fly-list. The check-in agent then referred the matter to her supervisor, and even the supervisor was unable to resolve the matter. The supervisor then confirmed that it was negligence on the airline's part and that Level has a bug in their check-in system and all this is not my fault at all. At that time, we had already passed the closing time for check-in and there was no way that I, nor my check-in luggage could make the flight in time. The supervisor then took screen shots of the system error on her computer & emailed the Level Airline Manager in Paris. Due to time zone difference, the Manager was not able to reply her promptly, so she told me to go home and wait for a reply from the Manager. The next day I was told that the Manager could not guarantee that they can fix the bug in their system in time for me to board onto their next flight which was the next day, and also my flight back from ORY to EWR.

The flight to Barcelona, unlike our return flight, was not completely terrible. Pros: we departed and arrived on time, our bags arrived intact, and the entertainment options onboard were great. The WiFi was mediocre, but that’s pretty common on most international flights. Cons: the flight attendants were hands down the rudest I have ever encountered. This is the only airline I have encountered that does not provide you with one glass of water on a 12 hour flight unless you request it and pay $5 for it. The return flight was a  disaster.  We arrived at the airport in Barcelona almost three hours before our departure time. We were unable to complete our check in online due to a computer error. We had a bag to check anyway, so we figured we’d just do it at the airport. However, when we arrived, the check in line was incredibly long and just got longer after our arrival. The line moved unbelievably slow. No one knew why. There were 5 attendants checking people in - all of them for our flight. They were each taking an average of 10 minutes to check in each party. After an hour of this and having hardly moved in the line, I went to front to find out what was going on and if we were going to make the flight. Found out that the computer error was universal and that no one could check in online. But the fact that this was not communicated to any of us in line made for a very tense situation. I was later told by another passenger in line that an attendant had told her they would hold the flight until everyone had checked in and gotten on board. But they never changed the flight departure time, and as it got increasingly closer to departure time, we all grew more and more worried. Add to this that the airport had poor air conditioning. After over 2.5 hours in line, we finally got checked in. The attendant told us that she hoped we made the flight, but to run, because it was departing in 10 minutes. And we still needed to get through security. So we ran. At the gate? “We are trying to hold the flight for you. Please hurry.” Once through, then wait in an shuttle bus with 40 sweating passengers to take you to another terminal to the plane. Rushed and pushed by employees and still left an hour late.

"""tickets were in fact suspended""",1,2018-05-28,"I was amazed by the prices - $280 round trip from Boston to Barcelona. However they have managed to charge me multiple times, and I will never fly with them again. First - I booked my flights on Level.com in January. I received confirmation, saw the appropriate charges on my credit card, no problem. Then four days later, a mysterious charge appeared on my card for $291 USD from Iberia with no associated ticket number. I called them, but they had no record of charging me this money and suggested I call my bank to have the charge reversed. I called my bank and they were able to get me the money back in a few weeks. Good thing I checked my statement carefully, but this is unacceptable.  The day before departure, I decided to add a checked bag for $44 USD online. Got an email from LEVEL confirming that I had paid the baggage fee, and brought a copy of this email to the Boston airport. When I arrived, I was told that LEVEL could not honor this because the confirmation email that I had received didn't include a record number or barcode. They made me pay again, $55 this time, to check my bag. They told me they could not reimburse my original paid fee, and that I would need to speak with the Iberia agents in Barcelona. I tried to do that once I arrived, and they directed me to call LEVEL customer service and get it sorted out. I decided to wait until I returned from my vacation to get my money back. I went to check in online for my return flight to Boston, after receiving the standard 'time to check in' email. Except my booking said I couldn't check in online. Okay, whatever, I go to the airport and check in. When I arrive, I'm told that my ticket was suspended because I never paid for it! I pull up all of my confirmation emails, the check-in email, the listing on 'My Bookings' on the LEVEL website, and even my credit card statements. All of this this clearly demonstrates that I have booked and paid for this flight months ago, and was never told that there was any issue with my payment or anything.

This seems incredibly sketchy to me - why can't they refund me directly, given that they have plenty of documentation that I had paid for the original ticket?! They provide me with some documentation that the tickets were in fact suspended. So I call my bank. My bank is also shocked that Iberia is refusing to refund me directly, since there's no real dispute here - they charged my card, they issued me a confirmation, and then they didn't honor my ticket.

Excuses consist of “system isn’t working"", "" the supervisor is only here from 6am-3pm, ""the supervisor is only here from 8am-3pm"". I was sporadically hung up on. When I asked to review them. I was not given a website. I was told its too late for a refund. Even though I called in the 24 hour period. I booked a flight on 9/8 from EWR to Paris return. Two separate one way tickets for my boyfriend and I. Great deal $306 for both tickets per person. I did not receive a confirmation form my flight from EWR - ORY. I called Level for help. Their staff is all Spanish speaking. No one can quickly and concisely help you if you are speaking English. On 4/8/18 I called Iberia for help. A man instructed me that the purchase did not go through and to re purchase the ticket. I called my bank and confirmed that the purchase did not go through. I re purchased again. The man insured I would be reimbursed if the charge appeared on my account later. I repurchased the ticket through the man with Iberia. I Still did not receive confirmation that this ticket was purchased until 2 days later. If you use their website to confirm the booking - good luck by my tickets never showed up under “my booking”. This time two transactions showed up on my card 2 days later. April 13th two more charges appeared. I decided to cancel the flights on April  8th in the 24 hour period. I canceled because of the additional time and cost it would take to get from home city to EWR. This cancelation was made less than 12 hours form the original purchase. I called on 4/8/18. The man could only see one of the tickets purchased. He was supposed to cancel the flight with the purchase that went though. He said refund would be made in anywhere from 5-30 days? 5 - 30 days?! They should know when a refund will be made! It is APRIL 20th and I am still yet to receive a refund for the ticket from PARIS- EWR. For $314 dollars. I called on 4/18/18. Agent was able to help me get a refund for the $148 that appeared on my bank statement on April 13th. I received and email with the refund receipt that same day I called April 18th. However the refund was for the incorrect amount. I then received a random $97 from Iberia. The refund receipt has no details or information on it. So I do not know where this $97 dollars is coming from!  I am awaiting a call from the supervisor to find out why I have not received this refund. I have never called probably 10 times. This is the most exhausting and frustrating process I have ever went though with a company.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Newark,April 2018,,,,,1,,,False
"""I will recommend the airline""",10,2018-04-18,"Barcelona to Los Angeles. I was very impressed with Level. We flew to Barcelona on Norwegian and returned on Level. I think that they really got things right with Level. The flight was on-time. The cabin crew was friendly, elegantly dressed and service was excellent. As the result of a recent fall I have a fractured disk and the gate agent went out of his way to find a seat with more legroom and did not charge me although I would have been happy to pay for the upgrade. We did not order the meal service because the a la carte menu was excellent and fairly priced. In-flight entertainment was very good as well. The only negative I can think of for this flight was that the one hour of wifi that I ordered went down after 15 minutes so I will try to get a refund. Baggage handling was excellent. I will fly Level again next year as we hope to go back to Spain to visit family and I will recommend the airline to our friends and family in that country.",True,A330,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Barcelona to Los Angeles,April 2018,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",5,5,,2,True
