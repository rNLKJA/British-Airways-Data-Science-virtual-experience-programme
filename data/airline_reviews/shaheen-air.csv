Shaheen Air customer review,7,2015-08-08,"Although a low cost airline, Shaheen Air was quite nice, although the airport check-in was pretty bad with only one line and the agents taking forever. The flight had a gate change 4 times, and we had a one hour delay announced at the last minute before boarding was to finish. The flight attendents were very friendly during the flight and the aircraft was decent, also the meal (some chicken mayo bun with a chicken leg along with marble cake) was pretty delicious and filling. The plane was leased and originally from SpanAir so the cabin had grey leather seats, but it was comfortable though. Also a nice touch from Shaheen Air was the pre-takeoff water which was provided and newspapers in English and Urdu.",False,A320-200 AP-BLK,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Karachi to Multan,August 2015,4,5,,2,5,,,True

Shaheen Air customer review,6,2015-07-18,"Flight reached Lahore 1.5 hours late but otherwise it was okay. Flight attendants were nice and stopped passengers from getting up whilst the seat belt sign was on. The plane was packed but the first 3 rows were open, I was in row 4 and we moved up and a row and sat comfortably. Everything else was fine. The toilets were a mess, they were leaking and the drainage pipe was closed plus no toilet paper. I would recommend this flight as a second option.",False,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Kuwait to Lahore, Pakistan",July 2015,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",3,3,,,True
