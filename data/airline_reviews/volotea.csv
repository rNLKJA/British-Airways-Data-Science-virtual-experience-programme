"""a second very pleasant experience""",10,2022-11-09,"This was our second time flying with Volotea and a second very pleasant experience for the whole family, from the start of the booking process until our return home. I myself fly quite frequently and I find Volotea among one of the best airlines that I have flown with so far, booking of flights is done fast, the price is clear and there are no hidden costs or unnecessary extra charges. The process before the flight is very user-friendly. This time we also had some questions about luggage policy (just needed a confirmation that every passenger can have his own suitcase) and I sent an inquiry to their Client team and got an answer within the promised 3-days period. As for our departing and returning flight - whole process (check-in of passengers and luggage, boarding) went smoothly and what I liked the most was that the flights were punctual by their departures (no delays, which is a very positive surprise lately) and the arrivals to both destinations were also even ahead of schedule! Another example of good practice that Volotea uses and that I find very useful is by deboarding when they invite passengers to stay seated and only to leave their seats and the plane progressively (usually when a plane lands, all passengers stand up and then wait crowded for dismemberment, by Volotea, flight attendants announced in advance that passengers should stay in their seats, and then - when everything was ready (hand luggage, connection to the terminal established or stairs and buses outside ready) - they called four rows in a row to disembark and by that avoid unnecessary crowding.",True,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Venice to Olbia,November 2022,5,5,,5,5,,True,

Despite the strenuous written restrictions on baggage dimensions and weight, which I had been very cautious about, everyone else appeared to be on the Silk Road and were all bringing the contents of a small store on board. However, as it was, on this occasion, a fairly innocuous experience. Very much could do without having to download the app or print out boarding passes (who can print when on the road, seriously), or pay an extra 30 euros per person for the privilege of having them go through the onerous business – all that stuff and the moveable feast that is the baggage restriction really leave a bad taste.

This time (third time), I tried to check in online 4 days before my flight (when online check in opens), and I tried several times. I always got a message saying that online check in was not available for my flight, and that I had to go to the check in desk in order to get my seat number. I called Volotea's customer support, and I contacted them on WhatsApp as well. They told me I had randomly been chosen to check in at the airport, as the webpage was overloaded (apparently it is always overloaded, as I am never able to check in online whenever I have booked flights with them). I told them about my previous experience, and said I wanted to check in online before going to the airport, but they told me they could not help me, and they said I had to go to the airport 2 hours in advance.

I complained and said it was not possible for me to check in online before the flight, customer support had told me I would get my allocated seat once I got to the airport 2 hours in advance, and even though I went even earlier, I did not get a seat nor a solution.

"""book with any other competitor""",1,2021-10-24,"Of all the bad experiences I've had with an airline, Volotea is by far the worst. I'm almost impressed at how dreadful they made the experience. 1) Baggage change - I couldn't change my baggage allowance online, and when I got in touch with their customer service via email, they told me several times to use the website. I sent them screenshots of how that wasn't possible, so they finally recommended that I call. During the call, they still couldn't upgrade my baggage allowance and then notified me about my cancelled return flight. 2) Cancellation without notice - they cancelled my flight from Santorini back to Athens without telling me. They said they sent an email, and I searched for all the emails they sent to my Gmail and screenshot it, and it clearly didn't have an email on the day when they said I would've received it nor the subject line. It also wasn't in my spam folder. I asked them to then tell me what other options I had that week, and they said they had no other flights from Santorini back to Athens. Really? Then I had to ask them to refund me for that portion, and confirm that it wouldn't affect my departing flight. They said they would do so, and yes, it wouldn't affect my departing flight. 3) Athens kiosk not open - there was a very long line at the kiosk, and the workers very rudely told all of us that they wouldn't even talk to us until 1.5 hours before departure. That would have been potentially fine if they were nicer about it, but then ... 4) Departing flight reservation missing - of course, after all the incompetence and rudeness, I found that my departing flight was indeed affected by my request for a refund. They told me that I had cancelled my entire reservation. No, I protested, not only did I have a log of the name of the representative and time of the call, but I had an email with the revised itinerary for just the departing flight. They disagreed, even with the email and boarding pass, they said they couldn't find my name in the system and I'd need to rebook. Fine, as despicable as they were and abhorrent as it would be to give them more money, I had to be at a wedding in Santorini. After many calls with the airport's concierge and waiting fretfully as the final call at the gate approached, the concierge finally told me they confirmed I had another booking to take to the kiosk.

On the return flight we arrived in Verona to see that the flight was running to schedule with expected departure at the advertised time. The flight was initially delayed for 10 mins then 2 hours followed by a further 4 hours. For food and refreshments we were given a whole 5 Euro which could buy you a cup of tea or coffee and a croissant. Children and infants could only get tea or coffee. Bearing in mind that most of the passengers had been travelling since 9 am and the flight eventually departed at 8.30 pm. On the bright side Volotea had chartered a plane from Air Malta to bring us home. The staff were very pleasant and helpful except that Volotea had chartered them to fly us to another airport and did not provide us again with refreshments or snacks. many of the passengers did not reach their cars until well after midnight. I for one will most certainly not travelling with Volotea ever again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,1,,False,
Volotea customer review,1,2014-08-08,Venice to Olbia and back. My first trip with Volotea and it did not leave a good impression. Flight from Venice to Olbia was somewhat OK they did not inform us that there would be a 45 min delay until 10 min before scheduled departure. From Olbia to Venice - disaster! Our flight was scheduled to depart at 7.55 pm. When we arrived there was a notice of a 3 hour delay on the screens in the airport. A passenger checked the website of Volotea and our flight was rescheduled to fly at 2.45 in the morning. In the mean time Volotea rescheduled our flight to 5 in the morning! Then - another change in departure time: 2 pm! Those passengers who could afford to go a hotel went. Those like me stayed the night at the airport. There was also another scheduled Volotea flight at 11.10 the next morning but we were told we could not get on that plane. At 9 o'clock in the morning there was another delay and our flight was moved from 2pm to 3.30 pm that is when I had enough and demanded that they put me on the flight at 11.10 am. I think I was lucky because I was travelling alone so they could find me a seat. Olbia staff changed my flight ticket without any additional costs. But even this flight had a 40 min delay so it's a never-ending story. My recommendation for you: If you have nerves and time and you're very flexible with your traveling use Volotea.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,3,,False,

Volotea customer review,5,2013-07-21,LIL-NTE return. Great low cost with attractive prices the 717's were fitted with new leather seats. Crew friendly on both flights however the crew could give more technical information about the flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,5,,True,
Volotea customer review,5,2013-07-11,Strasbourg to Bordeaux and from Nantes to Palermo Sicily. They have an all Boeing 717 fleet. Aircraft's are spotlessly clean and flight crew friendly and attentive. The only problem with Volotea seems that they can't put their act together. On January 2013 I was supposed to fly r/t from Munich to Nantes. 2 weeks before the flight they cancelled the route. In April they moved my June 24 flight to Palermo to June 25 and my June 21 flight from Munich to Bordaeux had a day and schedule change just a month before. At the airports in Strasbourg and Nantes each flight had at least a 3 hour delay and this was informed to passengers 30 minutes before scheduled departure. The handling agent staff seemed to be ashamed of even giving Volotea service. I would still give them a second chance only on routes were I could run and take a train in the event of a lengthy delay. Their routes are still very interesting.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,False,
Volotea customer review,9,2013-07-11,VCE-JMK-VCE on B717-200. Both legs on time. Good Legroom and fairly comfortable leather seats. Baggage Drop both in Venezia and Mykonos quick and organized. They stick to the condition of carriage for both weight and dimension of carry on bags. Prices for food/beverage on par with other European Low Cost carriers. Quick delivery of bags both in Mykonos and Venezia. Will definitely consider flying again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,4,,True,
