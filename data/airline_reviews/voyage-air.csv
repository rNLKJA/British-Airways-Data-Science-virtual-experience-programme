"""Complete Scam, rip off company""",1,2021-08-09,"Complete Scam, rip off company I purchased tickets then got an email to say flight was cancelled. There has been no further correspondence/communication. They are not responding to emails. I have sent emails to the one listed on their websites and also to the 6 emails listed for the owner. The emails to the alleged owner failed to deliver. I went to the offices at the registered address - it does not exist. The phone is never answered. I tried to contact the owner on linkedin - no response. Probably just another Bulgarian money laundering scam.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Varna to Erfurt,July 2021,,,,,1,,False
