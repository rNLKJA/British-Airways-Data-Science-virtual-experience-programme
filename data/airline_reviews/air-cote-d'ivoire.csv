"""A dreadful experience all the way""",1,2021-07-28,"A dreadful experience all the way. Started at Conakry airport where I was told the time of the flight had been changed for 2 weeks but no notice where sent to passengers even business class even if it is possibly the most expensive ticket I have ever bought related to the number of miles flown. So 4 hours of unnecessary wait. The seat was nothing better than adequate and the cabin crew did not care about me even if I was the only passenger in Business class, easy to understand why! No meal offered on a more than 2 hours flight, only luke warm ordinary champagne served in the kind of soft plastic ""glasses"" you find in office water fountains. Horrendous experience when I connected in Abidjan: all passengers had to walk several hundred yards on the tarmac in the middle of vehicles and planes, with no staff to assist, even on a security standpoint. On the second leg, zero service, zero meal, zero drink. Horrible experience.",True,A319 / DHC 8-400,Business,Business Class,Conakry to Accra via Abidjan,May 2021,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,False
