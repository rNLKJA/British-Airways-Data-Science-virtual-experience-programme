"""They are an unprofessional nightmare""",1,2021-09-04,"The most unprofessional airline, I have no idea how they are in business. I booked my trip through an agency, otherwise I would’ve booked via Turkish Airlines since it comes out to be the same price as this awful Jordan Aviation. I have a teacup poodle that always travels with me in cabin, I made sure that he was able to travel with me and made arrangements in advance, not to mention his ticket price was more expensive than mine. Upon reaching the airport, the Jordan Aviation counter told me they don’t accept pets in to the cabin and he must go into cargo, I pulled up their website and showed them their own policy and they said the rules have changed, sorry we didn’t update the website and the system and our colleague must not have been aware of the rule changes or else you would’ve been informed. How is that even my problem, too bad, you call yourselves an airline and can’t even modify or update your terms and policies! After having no choice I had to call a nearby pet store and beg them to send me a hard cage with a taxi to give my poor 2kg dog to the cargo! They are an unprofessional nightmare, anywhere else in the world they would’ve been sued for such incompetence and the audacity they had, sorry nothing we can do about it! The airplane was old, dirty and uncomfortable. And they still haven’t updated their website or policies",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amman to Istanbul,August 2021,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,1,False
"""Seems like a well run airline",9,2018-08-22,"Sharm El Sheikh to Amman. It was my first time taking Jordan Aviation flight (not by choice but that was what my travel agent had chartered and really had no choice but to go on a Jordan Aviation flight). I was a bit worried about aircraft age, delays, unattentative and confused staff and not least, expected commotion during a busy season (Eid holidays) when aircraft could very easily be overbooked, delayed and anything that can come to your mind! But hey, surprise, surprise...as an avid, aviation enthusiast, and frequent flyer (and an aviation insurance professional) I was pleasantly impressed. The aircraft was an older 737-300. Aircraft was clean, comfortable leather seats that could recline (the only down side is it needed a bit of wiping of the front trays and the windows which were really smudged), the toilets were clean and very much acceptable knowing that this aircraft was a workhorse doing the Sharm- Amman flights non-stop (3 to 4 daily flights during a very busy season). Great and friendly ticket/ground staff. Easy check in. As an avid aviation enthusiast/professional, I pay special attention to anything that seems not quite right. Cockpit and cabin crew, very professional (with smiles). Equal to or better than similar carriers and must say National flag carriers. - On time. - I lost a piece of luggage on arrival. Jordan Aviation staff came to me quickly and assisted me until I found my lost bag. I was grateful for his help. He did this with a constant and reassuring smile. The negative: Front trays and back seats need a good wipe! The windows too! I will not hesitate taking a JAV flight again. Seems to me like a well run airline. My flight from Amman to Sharm El-Sheikh on the 17th of August was equally good and can replicate was has been said above (aircraft JY-JAP) a Boeing 737-400. Absolutely no issues. Summary No unpleasant surprises. I was travelling with my wife and 3 kids and did not want any unpleasant surprises. Will fly Jordan Aviation again for sure. Well done.",True,Boeing 737-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sharm El Sheikh to Amman,August 2018,5,5,,5,5,,,True
