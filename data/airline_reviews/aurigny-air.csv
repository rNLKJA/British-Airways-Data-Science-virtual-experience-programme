"""treated me like a suspected terrorist""",1,2021-03-18,"Not Verified |  Flown this route return 4 or 5 times. Of course, a visitor to Guernsey has no choice, the airline has a monopoly. The flights themselves were only an hour, and uneventful. Aurigny flight team is usually OK. Not rude, but not terribly friendly, either. My last trip, the Guernsey airport staff was a very bad dream. They treated me like a suspected terrorist (I'm a past-middle-aged solo female traveler.) Kept me until the plane was completely boarded. I was the last one allowed on board. They opened my suitcase and removed every single item. They turned my book upside down and flipped the page, looking for who knows what. I fully expected sniffer dogs at some point. Since the trip itself had been stressful (horrendous weather, hotel room robbed), this last insult was so upsetting! I was finally allowed on the plane, but fighting tears.

"""disappointed in this service is an understatement""",1,2019-01-16,"Aurigny has a monopoly on flights in Guernsey so you have no other option that to book with them. The staff on board the flight look miserable, like they do not enjoy working there at all. The checkin staff at Gatwick were ok but the checkin at Guernsey was bad, such grumpy staff. We were 2kg over on checkin which was quoted as going to cost 20pounds! We only had 3 carry-on bags (out of our limit of 4) and the plane wasn't full, so common sense would say just let it through. Instead we had to take the 2kg out and make a 4th carry-on bag. So the weight is still in our entitlement but what a pain! Then on arrival to Gatwick our brand new expensive Samsonsite suitcase had a huge gash on the front of it! I was shocked. There was no person at the baggage info desk at Gatwick (South Terminal). So when I got home and had a customer feedback email from Aurigny, I answered it straight away and told them about the problem. I got no response. I emailed Aurigny again after I returned home from my holiday only to be told: ""The online Survey that is sent out does not come from Customer Services. All claims have to come to this email address, and we have checked, and we definitely didn’t have any emails from you until yesterday. I’m afraid on this occasion we would have to recommend claiming through your travel insurance."" To say that I am disappointed in this service is an understatement.

Flew out from Manchester to Guernsey on 2nd August 2016, flight had slight delay but nothing too bad. Service onboard was rushed, drinks and duty free served very early into the flight, then cabin crew sat and chatted for the rest of the flight. The return flight was a shambles. Upon arriving at Guernsey airport we were asked if we would like to change our seats, I declined this offer. Upon boarding at the gate I was given different seat numbers from those I had chosen and paid for. I explained to the gate staff that I had chosen my seats prior to the flight and wished to sit on those seats, the gate staff looked at me and told me to sort it out with the crew. Upon boarding the aircraft the stewardess was heard to say that the seats we had been allocated were in the same area of the plane, so could not see a problem. I stated that we required our chosen seats, which other passengers were sitting on. She did ask these passengers to move, which they did. If we had accepted the alternative seats, there was infact passengers sitting on these too. Again the drinks were served very early in the flight, but this time there was an announcement stating there was no hot water so only cold drinks could be served. Quickly after this came the duty free. The cabin crew spent the rest of the flight chatting to a passenger who also worked with the airline, talking very loud so that announcements made by the pilot could not be heard. I have flown on many airlines in the past, both scheduled and chartered. I feel that the price charged is very high, considering it is only a 70 minute duration, and the service offered is extremely poor.

The stewardess, who was great, talked us through the crash procedure, hands on head and when told to brace lean forward. All very disturbing and scary. We landed safely but not with twists and turns and were greeted by 5 fire vehicles. We were told to collect our luggage and meet at a Menzies counter and a coach would take us on to Norwich. No one came with us, we waited in front of a monitor to see where our luggage was for 40 minutes, luckily another passenger found ours. We then struggled to find the Menzies counter.

After I paid this I wondered how I could be so stupid to book the destinations the wrong way around, to which the lady told me that it happens all the time because Aurigny Air's  website always changes the destinations so the outbound flight is from Guernsey (even if you have been linked to Aurigny Air's website from another website like skyscanner with specific flights already selected.) When I arrived at Guernsey and told some locals they agreed that it happens all the time and they have never heard of Aurigny charging customers to change the flights as it is a fault of their website. As for the actual flight it was pleasant and I enjoyed the complimentary drink (even though the journey is only 35 mins!) and newspaper, the staff were friendly and polite and seats were comfortable.

Turned up for my 5.15pm flight at just before 4pm and was immediately told story five hour flight delay nothing we can do, went to customer services - who were useless.

Return flight delayed - and on arrival parked at the terminal and yet had to be bussed around the airport. Overall dated airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False
Aurigny Air customer review,10,2011-07-08,Excellent flights to Guernsey & return. Attentive staff. ATR72 aircraft ideal for route. In flight free drinks welcomed and puts rivals to shame.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True
Aurigny Air customer review,9,2010-08-11,STN-GCI-STN. Overall package was professional and good value for money. The ATR -72 used felt like a white-knuckle ride for much of the journey - don't know if these aircraft are affected more by the turbulence. Attentive and cheerful FAs on both sectors and good updates from the flight deck. Only reason for not awarding more marks was a 2hr delay on return leg not entirely attributable to Aurigny and well dealt with. This airline really puts some of the larger carriers to shame regarding their standards of customer care.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True
Aurigny Air customer review,9,2010-05-09,STN to Jersey. Everything on time check-in sluggish at both ends but inflight service important to this airline. Free tea coffee or soft drinks and polite cabin crew though some announcements difficult to understand.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True
Aurigny Air customer review,10,2010-04-25,Gatwick - Guernsey. Showed up only slightly early for check in. Thought we were in for a shocker with the wait but luckily it was for the check in desk neighbor Viking airlines. Auringy desk (of course) had nobody there. Plane was clean. Service fantastic. Free paper was a nice touch and best airline tea.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True
Aurigny Air customer review,10,2009-11-30,Jersey to Guernsey the early flight. Everyone who likes to fly should fly this route. The Trislander is a real plane and you get to see it all happening from start to stop. Excellent value and a good experience all round.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True
Aurigny Air customer review,7,2009-11-21,Gatwick - Guernsey Return. ATR72 clean and tidy. Both legs on time. Seat pitch tight if you are tall but acceptable for 45 minute flights. Complimentary soft drink cabin crew working fast to complete full service in tight time constraints. Overall a good regional carrier but with one irritating gripe. There is a £3 fee to choose your seat in advance this under the current climate is not too bad. However if you book a fully flexible ticket and subsequently change your flight although there is obviously no fee for changing your flight you will be expected to pay the £3 AGAIN if you want to choose a seat on the new flight. If you are on a flexible ticket you should really only have to pay the fee for choosing a seat once.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True
Aurigny Air customer review,10,2009-07-20,LGW-GCI. Very good flight no add-ons like FlyBe etc. Good price online check in free drink and a new ATR72 great value.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True
Aurigny Air customer review,9,2009-05-20,Return trip from Guernsey to London Stansted. Check In staff helpful and polite free 20kgs baggage allowance and on time departure. Cabin staff excellent. ATR aircraft (even the 2 new ones) are small and quite loud but okay for a 1 hour flight time. Free drinks and newspaper on board is a lovely touch.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True
Aurigny Air customer review,5,2009-04-26,Gatwick to Guernsey. Couldnt check in online as we had bags and a child which the system doesn't cater for but no queue at the Gatwick check in and the process completed in a couple of minutes. Flight on time. Free soft drinks and tea/coffee and a copy of the local paper was a nice touch. Brand new ATR72 - spotless! On arrival we waited just 5 minutes for our bags. On the return again no queue at check in on time and comfortable. Excellent value for money.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Aurigny Air customer review,4,2009-01-08,Flew to Guernsey from Gatwick. A great start to the New Year with no security queues at Gatwick (wish it was always like that) and a great flight on Aurigny. You get a choice of free soft drinks on board including tea and coffee but this excludes hot chocolate so I stumped up a £1 and had a hot chocolate and a free orange juice. Smooth flight on board the ATR72 though I thought the aircraft looked a little tired. Chatting to the cabin crew I learned that Aurigny is getting two new ATR72 aircraft in March so that should improve matters. Much the same experience coming home again that evening. All in all a good (short) trip to a wintry Guernsey and great value for money.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Aurigny Air customer review,4,2008-11-09,London Gatwick - Guernsey and return. Smooth check-in in both directions with pre-reserved seats. Smooth flights operating on time. Seats comfortable enough for 1 hr flights. Non-alcoholic drinks provided service efficient. Overheat lockers on the ATR72 are very narrow.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Aurigny Air customer review,4,2008-06-27,LGW-GCI. Used the new online check-in which was simple and saved a lot of time at the airport itself. Walking out to the aircraft wouldn't be fantastic on a rainy day. Flight time was just 40 minutes. The first impression of the ATR72 was that it was quite old and worn and noisy. Loads very low with 7 free rows in front of me and many behind too. Staff weren't unpleasant but I can't say they were particularly great either. Just average. Free drinks and arrival was especially easy. We were outside the terminal at Guernsey within 5 minutes of the engines being shut down.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Aurigny Air customer review,,2007-10-08,GCI-LGW-GCI. Flights on time both ways. Complimentary tea and coffee and soft drinks which is rather rare these days and no charge for hold baggage. Cabin crew ok but nothing special. Aircraft first generation ATR72 which are rather tatty inside and my seat was covered in crumbs on the return flight rather noisy and a lot of vibration compared to jets and newer turboprops. I believe Aurigny are purchasing 2 new ATR72-500 which should be an improvement they certainly need to update the fleet. Reasonable fares as long as you can book well in advance otherwise the price is extortionate.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Aurigny Air customer review,,2007-08-27,GCI-MAN on ATR 72. Flight 20 minutes delayed due to late inbound (25 mins) but we were kept informed. Watching ground staff from the departure lounge one could see a very focussed and motivated group working together to reduce the delay. This is how it should be done but maybe it is easier for a small airline.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Aurigny Air customer review,,2006-10-26,Southampton - Alderney. Pilot just rolls up switches on and off we go for a great real flying experience. Superb flight on Trislander each row of seats has its own door and seats are comfortable enough. Great flight on a clear day flew over Southampton and Isle Of Wight straight down over a sparkling sea to Alderney. No catering or ife as it is too noisy and no aisle so unable to hand out drinks etc. If you want to experience real flying in a propellor aircraft an aircraft built like a brick wotsit and flown by super experienced pilots you must try this short hop.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Aurigny Air customer review,,2006-06-17,Bristol - Guernsey return. Wonderful Flights comfortable seats 2x2 enough leg room to remain comfortable for the short 55 minute approx. flights. Little delay on Outward journey but nothing to cause concern or interference with the trip. Usual sea fog caused return flight to have a delay of around 1 hour 20 minutes nothing anyone can do about natures elements and Sunday Maintenance of the aircraft has to meet States regulations. Return flight was as comfortable as the Outward journey staff equally friendly. Would not hesitate to recommend Aurigny to other travellers to the beautiful Channel Islands Good to see the airline growing and modernising since the States took it over. Only downside to Air Travel between Islands as in to do day trips to different Islands via plane is the horrendous Taxes and Fuel Surcharges which made any chance of us visiting the other Islands impossible on price which is a shame as other Islands lost out on tourist spending which is important to the economy of the Islands.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Aurigny Air customer review,,2006-06-17,MAN-GCI-MAN.They use atr 72 on this route certainly more comfortable than the saab 340 used previously. flight only 70 mins catering minimal crew friendly and helpful. ticket pricing is now more realistic for the distance flown than a few years ago. all in all a good means of getting to a wonderful island.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False

Aurigny Air customer review,,2005-07-11,Bristol to Guernsey - a 45 minutes flight. Top marks - it could not have been better if we were royalty. Will be using again in a few weeks going back for another wonderful holiday in Guernsey.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False
Aurigny Air customer review,,2005-05-02,Flew GCI-LGW 19th April with Aurigny. Very smooth check in at Guernsey followed by a comfortable flight to Gatwick. Ground and flight staff friendly and efficient. Nice 2x2 seats on ATR 72 makes for a more comfortable flight than alternative 146 aircraft and seating.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False
