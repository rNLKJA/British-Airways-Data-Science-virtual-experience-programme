"""wonderful friendly airline""",9,2018-06-14,"Not Verified |  Vancouver to Whitehorse. Air North is a wonderful friendly airline serving the Yukon. Their combination of an older fleet and genuine hospitality makes it the ideal way to get to Canada's beautiful Yukon. There is no IFE on board any of their aircraft which can be a downside for longer trips, but the food is all free and comes is greater quantity then the meal options you pay for on mainline carriers. Air North's flights are finished with a warm cookie service which is always enjoyable. Overall a great airline and great customer service!",False,Boeing 737-500,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Whitehorse,June 2018,4,5,,5,4,,True
Air North Yukon's Airline customer review,6,2015-06-20,"Air North describes its class of service as ""Yukoner Economy"", which I thought probably referred to a concept of warm-hearted hospitality and generosity. This held true for my first flight in their 737-400, but after flying in the HS748 I'm wondering if the term is actually more about resilience in the face of harsh conditions! Cramped conditions in the HS748 aside, the service overall was pretty good - staff were (almost) all friendly and efficient, flights ran on schedule, and reasonable food was provided. No in-flight entertainment system, but at the time I flew, the stunning ever-changing landscape below was all the entertainment I could want.",False,B737 / HS748,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Inuvik via Whitehorse,April 2015,3,4,,4,3,,True
Air North Yukon's Airline customer review,4,2011-08-21,YVR-YXY in Economy. Check-in agents were quick and boarding commenced on time. On board the aircraft was old and not well maintained and in need of refurbishment. No inflight entertainment and seat pockets tray table and carpet were dirty. Inflight snacks mediocre. Seat was worn and not comfortable though the pitch seems to be pretty standard with Air Canada. Cabin crew announcements were rushed and inaudible. Service was the highlight and the crew were friendly. Flight arrived on-time and baggage was a short wait.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False
