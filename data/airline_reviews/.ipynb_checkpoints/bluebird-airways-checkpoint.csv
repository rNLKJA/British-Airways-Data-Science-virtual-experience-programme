"""most definitely not recommend them""",1,2022-10-16,"Not Verified | Absolutely the worst airline I have experienced. Most definitely not a cheap flight! Paying £322 with no suitcase in off-peak time for just one hour flight most definitely there is no bargain there. You can bring 5kg of free luggage wow thanks! Most cabin luggage these days is at least 3kg per suitcase which only truly gives you about 2/3 kg to play with unless you pay £40 for 20 kg each way. The 40-minute flight from TLV! Absolutely ridiculous not to mention they are not running on time. Will never ever fly with them again and most definitely not recommend them. This company is an absolute joke. My flight was meant to leave at 18:25, 3 days earlier I received a WhatsApp text to inform me that the flight time has been changed and the new flight time is 11:10 am! I replied to the text requesting a bit more info sadly as anticipated no response at all! I cannot make it for 11:10 there is a reason why I chose the later time. Absolutely a joke of a company. I feel so stupid for not reading the reviews before buying the ticket. Certainly, I will never fly with them again never.",False,Boeing 737,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tel Aviv to Larnaca,October 2022,1,2,,,1,1,,False
"""Horrible experience""",1,2022-08-18,"Horrible experience. An outdated airline with no online checkin and very non standard carry limitations of 5 kg per passenger. After hours long waiting to check in due to non professional staff, I had to weigh my small handbag as they try to charge everyone. Seats are dirty and falling apart only held by duck tape. Worst experience I have had with an airline low cost or otherwise",True,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tel Aviv to Crete,August 2022,1,3,,,1,1,,False
"""did not refund the money back""",1,2022-07-04,"They cancelled our flight and we asked for a refund one year ago, it has been a full year and they did not refund our money yet. I wrote several emails and called several times but they keep saying “in process” and did not refund the money back. The worst airlines in the world",True,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kos to Tel Aviv ,August 2021,,,,,,1,,False
