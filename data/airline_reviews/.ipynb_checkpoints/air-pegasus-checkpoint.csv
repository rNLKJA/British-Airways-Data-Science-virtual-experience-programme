"""forced to change my travel date""",1,2016-07-13,✅ Verified Review | Air Pegasus cancelled my flight two times and I was forced to change my travel date at last minute. I booked flight OP103 BLR-TRV departing 18:30. Few weeks before the departure date they informed me that they are cancelling the flight due to operational reasons. So they modified my booking and provided seats in OP101 BLR-TRV departing at 06:30. The evening before the departure they cancelled OP101 stating operational reasons. I called their customer care number. I could not speak to anyone until 21:30. When I asked them for alternate arrangement they said they dont have any flights and asked me to reschedule my trip for 1 day later. They refused to provide a seat in other airlines. Only option they gave were to cancel the booking or to fly at the later date. The last minute fares were so high that I could not afford to cancel and book on another airline. So I was forced to change my travel date. This is a very common practice of Air Pegasus. There are many issues related to last minute cancellation reported by passengers. Beware of Air Pegasus. Anytime they can cancel the flights stating operational reasons.,False,ATR72,Family Leisure,Economy Class,BLR to TRV,July 2016,2,1,,,1,1,,False

"""amazing customer service""",8,2016-01-24,"Amazing team at Hubli airport. We had to change the plane in Bangalore to get to Kochi and we might be late, however the team assured us that our baggage will go first from plane, when we have landed. Us and few other people in similar situation were brought by small bus faster than other customer to the airport and one guy from airport in Bangalore from Air Pegasus made sure and check our flights details that we will be on time.
