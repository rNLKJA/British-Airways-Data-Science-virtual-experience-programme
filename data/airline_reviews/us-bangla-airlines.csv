"""my experience was satisfactory""",7,2018-03-05,"Cox's Bazar to Dhaka with US-Bangla Airlines. The check-in process was smooth. The plane arrived exactly on time. But had to refuel for 15mins. We were on a full family trip. The staff was friendly and helpful. The seats were a bit tight and narrow. Food was average.  Landing was smooth. We got our baggage in time. I don't know about others, but my experience was satisfactory.",True,Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cox's Bazar to Dhaka,February 2018,3,5,,5,5,,True
"""very rude, very unprofessional""",1,2018-01-18,"Sylhet to Dhaka. Absolutely awful probably the worst airline, very rude, very unprofessional, don’t know how they can be so rude towards customers. I was at Sylhet  at 11am and had a domestic flight at 2:05pm, we had to wait 5 hours. We ended up missing our international flight and they put us in a very nasty hotel.",True,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sylhet to Dhaka,January 2018,2,1,,1,2,,False
"""unprofessionalism is really disgraceful""",1,2017-11-19,Dhaka to Jessore. It was really a bad experience when the plane started to take off and after a while there was problem with the flight’s fan or whatever there were some technical issues and then they stopped on emergency basis and later on after a while they started with the same plane though they told us to shift in a new one. After going a little further the plane again stopped at their runway due to the same problem. Then they shifted us to a new plane. The matter here is their unprofessionalism which is really disgraceful. I really would never like to fly with them again.,True,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dhaka to Jessore,November 2017,1,1,,1,1,,False
"""friendly and smiley flight attendants""",10,2017-01-23,"✅ Verified Review |  Dhaka to Jessore. I find the name of this private airline in Bangladesh a bit funny. Other than that no complaints. Arrived at the domestic terminal in Dhaka 7 minutes before the scheduled morning departure due to being severely delayed due to road traffic. The check-in desk completed all formalities, rushed us through security, had a limo ready for us to escort me and my partner to the aircraft at the remote stand. The flight left after our boarding and exactly on time. I have never experienced this kind of dedication and professionalism with an airline. The flight to Jessore lasted 25 minutes onboard a clean and attractive Dash-8 Q400 and we were served a sandwich, cake and a water bottle by friendly and smiley flight attendants. The return flight to Dhaka a couple of days later was just as good but we made sure we arrived promptly for check-in this time. We were served a mini burger, cake and water bottle.",False,Dash-8 Q400,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dhaka to Jessore,January 2017,5,5,,5,5,,True
