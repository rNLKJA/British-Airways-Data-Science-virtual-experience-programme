"""this has been the worst experience I have had traveling""",1,2022-11-17,"Not Verified |  Silver Airways is an incompetent/irresponsible airline. I left Boston on October 28, 2022, via JetBlue with a connecting flight in San Juan heading to Dominica via Silver Airways. Once I reached San Juan, I was told I would have to overnight in San Juan, due to the flight being cancelled by Silver Airways. In San Juan I had a conversation with the attendant at the counter and was told that my luggage would be added to my flight in the morning and it would be at my final destination. That morning my flight was scheduled to leave San Juan at 6am and was delayed. Upon arrival in Dominica my checked luggage was left behind in San Juan. I went to the counter, I barely received any help. I gave my information and I had to make several attempts on my own. I was forced to purchase and borrow clothes from family, due to the uncertainty of when I will receive my luggage. On my return back home, I had to borrow luggage to return home. I went to the airport two hours before the check in time to only be met with no one at the counter. The check in time was extremely painful after being in line for two hours. I finally made it through, we waited for over an hour on a hot plane and was only given a warm bottle of water, while sweating. This flight was delayed for over 4 hours. Upon arrival in San Juan, I still did not receive my borrowed luggage. Due to the delay, I missed my connecting flight with JetBlue and was rebooked with Delta. I was just handed a boarding pass with no direction as what to do. Rather than having a direct from San Juan to Boston. I had a connecting which added an additional 7hrs to my flight, which caused me to not be able to go to work. Overall, this has been the worst experience I have had traveling. I will not use or recommend Silver Airways to any family and friends. In the past I enjoyed visiting Dominica, Silver Airways has made me not want to visit back home, due to this traumatizing experience while traveling. After getting home to the US, it took a few days before my luggage was delivered to my family home in Dominica.

Upon arrival at the airport, we presented the ticket agent with our travel documents. My husband had his passport, Bahamas Travel Visa and a negative Covid test. I had my passport, Bahamas Travel Visa, a letter from my physician, and an exemption letter from the ministry of travel of the Bahamas granting me an exemption to the testing requirement as I had recently recovered from Covid.

At that time, we were told that the airline's safety officer was denying us travel because I did not have a negative test to produce. We had to go back to the ticket counter, where one of there agents saw us approaching and recommended we check with Bahamas Air.

He says he's waiting to hear back from his supervisor. We go sit down and wait. 45 minutes later he comes back and says they don't know where my bag is and they are waiting to hear from Key West. He said you can leave and I'll call you when he hears back. 5 hours later no one has called. So I scour the internet looking for a number that actually works for the Tampa Silver Counter. Finally get someone to pick up and they still haven't located my bag. 1 hour later someone calls me saying it got left in Key West and will be to Tampa by 8.30. I say so do I just go to the belt? He goes no, come to the ticket counter with your id. So I go back at 8.30, there's a sign saying the ticket counter is closed for the night. I roll my eyes and go down to the belt and thankfully it's there. I emailed ""customer relations"" and he said my bag didn't make the flight because of weight restrictions, which is fine but why did no one tell me and it took 6 hours to locate my bag.
