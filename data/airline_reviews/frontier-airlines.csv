My bag was really close to fitting inside the tiny dimension so I pushed in the corners and the attendant says “ma’am, you’re not allowed to push inside. It doesn’t fit. You need to pay $90”.

As carriers go, Frontier has consistently delivered a decent experience and has been more or less what you would expect from a discount airline. My now seven year old daughter loves flying Frontier because of the animals on the tail and wings. She really treasures the animal cards the flight attendants give her. Since we fly Frontier often, we make sure to only bring items that fit in the sizer and have been bringing the same bags for years. My daughter's little suitcase she brings just fits in the bin. Today, Weds, Oct 5th. as we happily boarded our 10am flight from DEN to MSN, we endured the usual bag size check. When I attempted to move the wheels of the bag so the bag could slide into the sizer, I was told that if I had to do anything to make the bag fit in the bin that we would have to stop boarding and pay a $99 carry on fee to bring the bag with us. I told the gate attendant (who I later learned was the manager) that I did not have $100 to spend and that we needed to get to WI so my daughter could see her grandparents. My daughter, upon hearing this exchange, burst out crying. The manager offered no kind words and sent me to the back of another line. We waited for a short time, my daughter sobbing as I tried to comfort her. When we got up to the front, the gate agent informed us we needed to pay $99 to board the flight with my daughter's bag. I let her know that the bag did fit and that it was the same bag we always brought when we flew Frontier. She offered no empathy and when asked to get the manager simply pointed at the gate agent that had sent us to her in the first place. When I insisted I talk to him she ignored me, told me to move, and began serving other customers to one side of my daughter and I when I refused and requested to speak to her manager again. After this, my daughter and I, both crying and feeling humiliated, stood to the side as several of our fellow passengers offered to pay the $99 so we could board the plane. I moved my daughter's belongings from her suitcase to a souvenir bag we bought at the nearest store and tried to comfort her while telling her we needed to throw away her suitcase (blue with rainbows, bought when she was three and one of her favorite things) so we could board the plane.

"""should’ve given me a full credit""",1,2022-09-07,"I was scheduled to leave Friday 9/2 via delta from Atlanta to Denver and fly back to Atlanta from Denver on Monday 9/5 via Frontier. I planned to meet my friend in Denver to hike in Rocky Mtn national Forrest. That Monday morning on August 29 I woke up sick. I knew I was flying and was worried about it being Covid so I took a home test that was positive. On top of everything else, my friend broke her foot the day before. There was no way this trip was happening. I immediately called to cancel my Frontier flight. I was offered 1/2 credit. Of my $256 ticket. I could have the other half if I could prove I had covid and home test were not valid. So I scheduled a test and the only appointment I could get was Saturday 9/3. Of course my test came back negative so I’m out $126. My 1/2 credit is only good for 90 days. Delta gave me full credit. Good for a year, no questions asked. Which seems more reasonable from a customer service point of view. I know I did not purchase flight insurance and so I appreciated the credit Delta gave me. I feel like Frontier should’ve given me a full credit with a longer time to use it as well. My friend is a traveling healthcare worker and I’m not sure where she is settling next. I may never get to use these credits. I booked it through Expedia.  The last time I flew I purchased flight insurance and never needed it. So I didn’t do it this time. I know this was my mistake and I will never purchase tickets again without flight insurance. Booking sites have less neon signs about flight insurance. It’s usually a box you check. I canceled my Frontier flight 7 days before departure. Had I purchased their works package (and known to) I could’ve received a full refund. I’ve read they are expanding and if that’s true they really should modify there half credit policy to stay competitive with other airlines. It blew my mind that Delta asked no questions and gave me a full credit, while I felt like Frontier was judging me for what I felt was an emergency or simply trying to do the responsible thing and not get on a plane if I have Covid or any contagious illness.

People in line started getting impatient. 30 minutes before the scheduled flight one of your employees showed up, checked in one person, then took the microphone and announced that she needs to go back to the gate because there is a plane coming. She then instructed us to wait until she came back and that the flight will be delayed. So we waited. Me, my husband, our 3 very small and very hungry children and about a hundred other passengers waited in line for over 2 hours to get our bags checked. Needless to say, the flight was already delayed. We finally took off and arrived in Georgia with over an hour delay. Then, we sat on the plane for an additional hour because the captain did not receive information on which gate to go to. It was already 2am and passengers on board were NOT happy, making calls to their family members who came to pick them up at midnight. The captain apologized to us a couple times saying that the airline is not straightforward with him on what's happening. We were finally let off at 2AM. Fast forward 2 weeks, it was time to fly back home. Our flight was scheduled for 7:43AM. Knowing that Atlanta airport is huge, we arrived 2h40 minutes before take off. We went to Frontier service desk exactly 2 hours before take off. This time, there were employees there but the line was massively long because there were 3 domestic Frontier flights leaving at the same time. We went to the self service baggage tag printing machines, printed our tags and stood in the line just to drop bags off. The line was moving very slowly because it turned out that 2 out of 4 employees checking people in were only checking in international flights. So once again we stood in line forever. By the time we got to the front of the line, it was 7AM. As a reminder, the flight was leaving at 7:43. The employee took our IDs, then told us that someone else would take care of us and put us in another line. Turned out that it was too late to check bags (by 2 minutes apparently) so we were going to be rebooked. We missed the flight ONLY because the inability of Frontier Airlines to provide enough staff to check passengers in in a timely manner. Just as a side note, we were already checked in, paid for bags AND printed tags. We arrived at the airport more than 2 hours before scheduled flight and we did everything we could ahead of time. The only responsibility of Frontier Airlines staff was to physically take our bags and put them on the belt. Going back to our airport experience, we were put in line to ""rebook"". Stood in this line for over an hour together with numerous passengers who also missed their flights because of the lack of competency of Frontier Airlines' employees.

I've been in a car accident recently and am temporarily unable to get around on my own. To help make things easier, I checked a bag instead of trying to wheelchair and crutch around with a heavy carry on. My flight was early morning (6AM departure) so I called frontier the night before for assistance and was assured multiple times I would have help at the airport in Denver to have access to a wheelchair and someone to help me get around. When I arrived that morning, I had no assistance from walking into the airport to getting to the gate from Frontier. Additionally, I had to find my own wheelchair as no one was at the station to help me and had to rely on other frontier customers to help move my baggage through the checkline while attempting to find this wheelchair (all the ones sitting out were locked and no one there to get them out for me). Frontier had no one available or planned ahead to help me push my baggage, to push my wheelchair to get me around, or to move me through TSA and to get to my gate, which Denver requires a train to get to gates and is a longer route than other airports. I was told I had to wait for help which they didn’t have anyone at the time and watch my timeline go down when it was 4:50AM at this point with a 5:20AM board time. I asked for help from the luggage line associate, the baggage check associate, and from random workers throughout the airport- everyone looked at me in a wheelchair struggling to get around and said ""Sorry, I can't help you"". I even overheard someone working with luggage complain about being asked to help me when they had luggage to get on planes at the check baggage area. To avoid being late, I started the path and elevator ride down to TSA on my own after informing the Frontier baggage associate I would like someone to catch up with me. She looked at me and said nothing and went back to her job. Once down the elevator, I was clearly lost and distraught as a TSA officer asked if I needed help when I got off the elevator and was looking around. It was emotionally distressful to have multiple people both with frontier and at the airport look at me and offer no help or tell me they couldn’t help when asked. I called Frontier to pursue a reimbursement of my return flight due to the experience and they offered me a $20 credit - it was offensive to offer practically nothing for someone who needed help and was assured they would have it. After declining, the offered $50 and I declined again wanting a manager. After discussing my experience with a manager, he said no reimbursement would occur due to the fact that I took the flight still. So the options were to cancel my flight, most likely pay for that cancellation, and reschedule all to have my experience be reimburseable to Frontier. This airline doesn't put their customers first and it was a sad, emotional experience needing help and having my worst fear of not getting assistance occur.

On Saturday, August 6, I was scheduled to leave Atlanta at 9:42pm. We ultimately left after 3am on Sunday, August 7. The entire experience was horrible. From the delays that were never explained to the lack of care for the customers. There were many families and children on this flight. Frontier made NO effort to provide water or snacks or items like blankets to make people more comfortable. We didn’t feel like it was prudent to head to the McDonald’s and wait in the 40-minute line because the gate personnel told us to stay close. I will say that the Frontier staff was friendly, but they were not helpful, nor did they show much empathy or compassion. One flight attendant told me “I’m in the same boat as you, I’d like to get airborne”. In fact, she was not “in the same boat”. We were paying customers and she was an employee earning a paycheck. I felt like her comment was a slap in the face. The delays we experienced were not due to weather or any uncontrollable circumstances. For example, why did we sit on the airplane for more than an hour with a combination of no pilots, no air conditioning and a very off-putting smell coming from the HVAC system once it was turned on? Why did we board our final plane so far in advance of our actual departure (about an hour)? We sat in uncomfortable airplane seats for more than double the flight time between Atlanta and Denver. Once we landed in Denver, why did no one call ahead to the concourse to ensure we could deplane with no more delays? Throughout my adult life, I have flown more than 1 million miles. I have experienced delays. I have experienced good customer service. I have NEVER experienced anything as bad as what took place on August 6. Upon walking through the airport in Denver I received a $50 credit email from Frontier. Again, this felt like a slap in the face. We were delayed for more than 5 hours. I’m sure people missed connections and family events and moments in their lives that could not be recovered. $50 is a complete joke. At the very least, Frontier Airlines owes each passenger on that flight no less than the full cost of their round-trip fare. If the passengers were only travelling one direction, you should compensate them with a fully paid round-trip credit. I am hoping this message finds someone that cares about Frontier's customers.

"""their customer service is terrible""",1,2022-08-03,"San Diego to Tampa Bay. I knew Frontier had a bad reputation for price gouge on bags, terrible customer service and unreliability and it seems they didn't disappoint. I paid an extra $250 for my girlfriend an I to have checked bags, carry on and ""premium"" seats. The Seats: The seats they claim give you an extra 8 inches are worthless. They are about the same as the rest of crammed seats on the plane and if you sit in the very front row you'll discover you have less legroom and personal storage then anyone on the plane. Checked Bags: Frontier does price gauge like crazy for those checked bags. As mentioned I paid for a bundle do that included my checked bags. Which came about to around $250 for 2 people. Well what they don't tell you is if your bag is over the 40lbs limit you have to pay an extra $50. For a single pound! But that's not even the worst part. We had a layover in Vegas and they misplaced our luggage. When talked too baggage services an they, ""This happens all the time"". So we filed a claim and they guaranteed us our bags would be back next day. The following day, they contacted us and told us that they received our bags and said we needed to be there before 11 o'clock to pick them up. And I arrive at 10:15 to pick up the bags and the ones in the baggage claim area. So we go to the check-in ticket stand to ask for assistance. The single employee Who is visible that works for frontier says ""well you guys are just gonna have to wait til 11"". At this point I almost lost it, because I was understanding of the system with it not being the employees fault. But clearly they don't care. I can visually see my bags in the baggage claim area and they're telling me I have to wait longer after they messed up. So my friend and I waited an extra 45 minutes to collect the bags that they misplaced. And of course they didn't shop back up to the baggage claim area on time. So I walked back to the checked bag area where there are literally eight employees standing around. When I asked them if they can assist me getting my bags two of them gave me dirty looks. And said you have to wait for the lady to go to the baggage claim area to do it because They were too busy. I'm so happy we paid the extra $300 for them to manage our bags. By the way you'll also see just help busy they were when I asked him to help me in the pictures that I post.. Clearly they were having an emergency that they couldn't help one customer.

We arrived at the gate only to be told that the plane was overbooked and was sold out. We had paid the additional $550 (bundle) to guarantee a seat. The lady at the gate said there was nothing she could do. We then asked for a supervisor who arrived at the gate. She explained there was nothing she could do. My wife was very upset, but not abusive, and was trying to understand how this could happen when we had paid for the seats. The supervisor was very rude to her. My wife would be speaking to her and she would “fake” picking up the phone to avoid her mid sentence. It was very obvious. We asked if our luggage was on the way to Albany and she laughed and said it was and she seemed to enjoy the fact that it was. It seemed to me that she was taking pleasure in that fact because we raised some objections to her. Additionally, we were told we would have to re-book the flight and that we would once again have to wait in line at checking and go through security again. She wandered off with no resolution to our problem. Unfortunately, as we tried to explain to the supervisor and gate agent, I have a medical condition and my meds for it were in those bags on the plane. I have to now rent a car, book a hotel, rent another car (I had to fly everyone to a city 2 hours away), buy clothing and essentials and seek medical care. Somehow this really amused the supervisor because my wife was firm with her at the gate. She really took pleasure in our suffering as retaliation. I really believe that to be the case. I have never been treated so poorly. Never. I would love the opportunity to ask that supervisor what exactly is amusing about any of this?

"""I feel a bit like I've been robbed""",1,2022-04-22,"Frontier Fails At Customer Service. My wife and I recently traveled from Orlando to Memphis via Frontier. The website navigation and the purchasing of tickets was straightforward but misleading (they advertise one price but then nickel and dime you to death, but who doesn't these days?). In the ticket purchase process we had additional fees for luggage (who travels without luggage?). We purchased two bags to be checked. Frontier used to have a 50 lb. limit to their luggage. We discovered differently. You will read more about this in a moment. This was our fault - we didn't read the website carefully enough. Ok. I own what is mine to own. When the time came to pack for our trip we managed to get everything in one bag. We arrived at the airport and was shuffled from line to line. We got to the kiosk to drop our bag and was informed that it weighed 49 lb. I thought, ""okay?"" I was then informed that it would be a $50 overweight fee. Understand, we've traveled other airlines before where we were a little over before where we used only one of two bags. In the unfailing logic of customer service these airlines would waive fee due to the unfailing math of ""2 bags paid for"" - ""1 used bag"" = ""1 bag not used."" Any was subsumed in what was paid for. I currently sit on hold to talk with yet a third ""supervisor"" who cannot make $50 decisions for the company. Here is my math - check me: We paid for two bags or 80 lb. of stowage. We used 49 lb of stowage. We were charged an extra $50 for 9 lb. of stowage over forty (even though we paid for 80 lb). In my mind, we did not use 31 lb of stowage for which we paid. Then we were charged an extra $50 for not putting that extra 9 lb that we did use in a separate bag. In the end, with the penalty, I paid for 120 lb of stowage (as best we are able to calculate) I called customer service and after my third supervisor has now hung up on me after I was told ""we do not refund over charges on bags."" If I had only purchased one bag, I would not be here writing. I would be in my office licking my wounds feeling really stupid for doing what I did. It would be a $50 lesson - lesson learned. As it is, I feel a bit like I've been robbed. This does feel very dishonest to me. They may as well robbed me at gun point. That is hyperbolic for sure - they didn't use a gun but rather the threat of not being able to fly. They used their power and position to take $50 from me and then refused to work with me on a resolution by hanging up on me. Buyer Beware! Frontier does not use customer service logic. They apparently use a customer consumption logic. With Frontier you are not a person - you are redefined as a walking dollar bill to be manipulated and leveraged. I've kissed my $50 goodbye.

To start things off, we arrive 2.5 hours before our flight from PHL to PUJ. We walk inside and the line to check bags is hundreds of people long. Every other airline had a handful of people in line, frontiers line was about 200 feet long, and then wrapped back again. It was blocking the entrances to all the other airlines and right in front of the entrance doors, so it was essentially a free for all.

Take off was delayed by about a half hour, but luckily we reached our destination close to the planned arrival time. Now for the way home. Where to begin. Well we flew from Punta Cana to PHL, but we had a layover in Orlando. For some reason, the second leg of our trip home was already marked delayed about a month in advance. They pushed it back about an hour. Our experience in Punta Cana was great. More than enough staff. Bag drop was quick and the flight was delayed about 15 minutes but no big deal. Then we arrived in Orlando. Landed and sat in the plane for about 30 minutes with no announcement or anything from Frontier staff.

"""It was a disaster""",1,2022-04-04,"Today was supposed to be my (and my three kids) first flight with Frontier Airlines. It was a disaster. The aircraft had some mechanical problems. Those things happen. The communication from the staff was nearly non-existent. They showed up at the counter to announce delays (from 4:00 to 4:45 to 5:15 to 5:45 to 6:45 to 7:30 to canceled), stayed for a few minutes and then left. The passengers were generally unaware of what was happening. Naturally a long line formed in front of the counter because folks were changing - or attempting to change – their flight arrangements. No other customer service agents came to relieve the line. An email ended up being sent. The next available flight was not for four more days! Four options were given: 1) Up to $400 credit/traveler for travel with another airline. It’s Spring Break on 12 hours’ notice. $400 does not cover that. Not even close. 2) Full credit for my ticket plus $100. Essentially, the $100 voucher pays to ensure that the passenger does business with Frontier again. With flights as expensive as they are now, $100 is not much. The full refund (see option #4 below) is much more attractive but it’s cash in hand I have no chance of losing to circumstance. 3) Up to $400 total (not per traveler) for alternative transportation. In my case, this would have been a car rental. Between car rental and gas this also does not come close to covering my trip. It is also useless. 4) A full refund which is unfortunately the best and only option. After spending the day at the airport and disappointing drive home I had to look my kids in the eye and tell them that their trip to see their grandparents was canceled. I have never experienced a worse traveling experience than I experienced today and one of the most disappointing experiences in my life. Problems happen. Mistakes happen; we all make them.

We wanted to check in online but you had zero option to do this with military bags. We were advised by your employee to get into the checked bag line to avoid the $68 checked bag fee. We waited in line an hour and a half only to be told we missed our check in by 5 minutes.  And there was nothing you would do for us and directed us to the missed flight line. We stood in this line another 20-30 minutes and made it to the front where another one of your employees told the 100 or so people in this line to ""form another line over there."" We watched as everyone behind us was now in front of us. Where we waited another hour. We watched as this line became longer and longer with people in our exact situation. We had over a third of our flight to Boston miss their flights alone. The people in the ""missed flights"" line was just Frontier customers and this extended all the way down the entire airport. There was well over 500 people in this line by the time we got to the teller. More as we leave the airport.

An announcement was made that Frontier only had one person offloading luggage from the aircrafts, and that it was going to be awhile before luggage would be available. 3 hours and 50 minutes after they landed at MCO, my children finally got their bag before we could head home. Up to date I have not heard anything from Frontier Airlines since filing this complaint a week ago. On Thursday 7/29/2021, my wife and two daughters were to fly with Frontier to Phoenix AR for the Taekwondo World Championships that my daughter qualified for. Their flight was to make a connection in Atlanta to Phoenix. The flight out of Orlando got delayed numerous times because of “lack of maintenance personnel” and “waiting for clearance from Colorado” - wait for it, Frontier Airlines only having one person to do the maintenance check on the aircraft before take-off! The flight was delayed for 1.5 hours. My wife raised her concerns about missing their connection in Atlanta, but Frontier agent told her that there were 19 people on this specific flight that needed to make that connection, and there was no way Frontier would not wait on these 19 passengers to make the connection. However, Frontier decided the connecting flight in Atlanta to Phoenix would NOT wait on the passengers on the Orlando flight. The Frontier personnel merely shrugged it off and said the best they could do was to fly my family to Las Vegas, and then to Phoenix the next morning. Arriving at 8.30 am. My daughter was competing the next morning for the World Championships at 8am, something she has been training and preparing for for 5 years! At this point she was hysterical, and could see her dreams disappear before her eyes because of the incompetence of Frontier Airlines! My wife and daughters ran through Atlanta Hartford and finally found a flight with Delta Airlines that would get them to Phoenix that evening late. They had to pay an additional $1,765.00 for 3 one way tickets to Phoenix from Atlanta.

"""go with another airline""",1,2021-08-05,"I was drawn to Frontier because of the cheap flights (I just need to get from point A to point B), but it ended up costing me more. On the way to our honeymoon, our flight was delayed 5 hours with no explanation. That wasn't ideal, but it happens. Coming back from our honeymoon, Frontier cancelled our flight when we got to the airport with no explanation. They offered an amount for other airlines that wouldn't cover the cost of any flight, so we had to take their option of putting us on another Frontier flight the next day that (problems with that are explained below). We told the Frontier rep that Frontier needed to give us a place to spend the night since they messed us up. They gave us a piece of paper that said we would be refunded up to $150 for a hotel if we submitted the hotel reservation info on their website. The only place within that range was a cheap motel, but we went for it so we'd have a place to sleep. I had a feeling that they would find some way to avoid keeping their promise and reimbursing us. Sure enough, we submitted everything they asked for online and didn't hear from them for a month. After contacting them, they finally responded and said we wouldn't be reimbursed because we didn't have that piece of paper (just plain text on white paper) they had given us 1 month ago. The paper, the rep, and the website said absolutely nothing about needing that piece of paper. They had record of the flight being cancelled, our flight being changed to the next day, and that they had the document on their computer. Just a ridiculous way to avoid reimbursing us for the problem they put us in. For the new flight, instead of the direct flight from Denver to Philly that we paid for, sent us all the way down to Florida for a layover before flying back up to Philly, costing us an entire extra day and requiring us to pay for overpriced food at the airport (Frontier said they wouldn't help with any of this). Other people on our plane talked about missing important meetings and weddings because of Frontier's frequent cancelations.

Use the monitor at the gate to notify us of important changes.

Frontier's letter to us stated that they came up ""a bit short"" on handling our flight with them. Using the words ""a bit short"" after they changed gates on us without adequate notice is like saying someone on a hunger strike is ""a bit hungry"".

They only gave us 3 months to reschedule our flights, which is very hard to do not knowing when everything will open back up due to corona (Every other airline, gives you at least a year to reschedule). They only had flights scheduled for sunday and thursday. When I finally got in contact with someone, they said that they do flights day by day so more flights may or not be available.

After arriving at MCO at 5:30pm we had to sit in the plane on the tarmac for a good 30 minutes before even having a gate to get unloaded at. We finally got to the baggage claim at 6:15pm (our day started at 6am) which is crazy considering this was a 2 hour direct flight; we waited and waited, about 45 minutes after watching 2 different planes shoot out half of their passengers luggage we were told Orlando was short staffed and that Chicago's plane would be about 2-3 hours before we got our luggage, talk about a what wait moment.

He informed me that the demonstration for emergency information was going on and I needed to pay attention. I was unaware that my conversation was disrupting the other passengers from the presentation so I quickly apologized and waited for instruction to be done before resuming. Things ran smoothly after that, descent was near perfect and I was content with my experience. It wasn’t until the beverage cart came around that I can say I had an issue. Although airplane beer, wine and spirits are somewhat overpriced, I tend to pay the extra money to relieve some stress from travel.

Frontier Airlines is the worst airline I have travelled on in 35 plus years of business and personal travel and scores and scores of flights. The plane was delayed over 3 hours (8:20 PM flight from New Orleans to Philadelphia) for mechanical reasons. Frontier customer service told me there was nothing they could offer me to offset the cost of now having to pay for a lift or Uber to take me home (since my family would not be able to meet me at 3:30AM). I'm told they did offer food vouchers at the gate, but I was already sitting at the airport restaurant when I found out. It costs $45 for a carry on bag, which I knew, but seriously? The plane was very clean, but the seats really look like molded plastic with a cloth cover. And they pretty much feel that way. The tray table is smaller than an 8-1/2 x 11 piece of paper. No, it doesn't start small then fold out. It just is small. Flight was fine, but I really felt like I was flying in a tin can (and I have no fear of flying) so I just kept my eyes closed the whole time. When we arrived at the gate (a little ahead of time, thank you pilot), my carryon bag wasn't where I'd put it in the overhead. First I looked around and said ""Oh my God, where is my bag?"". Since I was sitting very close to the back I was maybe 6 people in front of the rear flight attendants, but no one responded, so I ran off and ran down the hallway shouting, ""Will everyone please check their backpacks? Someone accidentally took mine"". People were great, they checked and said ""Nope, it's mine"" as I ran past them. Defeated, exhausted, on the verge of tears I went back to the gate to check the overheads again. I couldn't get back on the plane, but one of service workers went on and checked for me. About 5 minutes later he came back with it and told me that it had been moved to the back of the plane to make more room! What? It's not unusual for a flight attendant to move a bag, but they always point to it or hold it up and make a general announcement, asking ""whose bag is this?"" and letting the person know the bag is being moved and where. So unprofessional and thoughtless. Overall, I'd say it's the worst airline with the laziest support staff I've ever dealt with (excluding the guy who actually opened his mouth, moved his legs and used his brain to try to help me). Full disclosure, I did get an email while I was in flight apologizing for the delay and offering me a $50 credit toward a future Frontier flight.  Their tagline is Low Fares Done Right.

The seats are uncomfortable, and baggage check is so pricey, the discounted ticket isn’t even worth not just paying more upfront and flying Southwest. You don’t even get standard complimentary beverages or snacks during the flight either, and have to order them if you want anything, no matter the length of the flight for extremely outrageous prices. We had already tacked on an extra $200 in baggage fees alone, this for bags that were carry-on sizes and were just not allowed to be considered ""personal items"" because they had wheels. We started out late by boarding the flight beginning 30 minutes later than scheduled, then spent another hour on the fully boarded plane sitting on the runway in Kansas City waiting to depart (for unexplained reasons). We ended up being over 2 1/2 hours later in total than what was scheduled by the time we had sat for another hour on a parked plane waiting on the runway for a terminal to become available to exit the plane in Orlando. This due to another plane having taken our plane's terminal for unloading because of our late arrival, and we could not exit until that plane and all its baggage was completely cleared and moved. We had set aside all of Sunday for traveling so that we wouldn't risk missing our first day at Disney... however, this did mean that on a Sunday night, all restaurants and delivery services were closed by the time we got our baggage claimed (which we finally did after roaming around aimlessly. Our bags had been moved to a different baggage claim terminal from what was stated when we were getting off the plane, and failed to be announced at the airport), found ground transportation, got an Uber and made it to our hotel. So we were unable to get anything to eat outside of vending machine stuff since we were without a vehicle, due to our plans to use Disney transportation throughout our stay at the park.

When I called to ask why they did not give me the 40,000 miles they told me the rule and immediately canceled my card and now we agreed, also in the fine print, to keep and use our information for 7 years even after we cancelled the card!

They state on the offer: ""after spending $500 on purchases in the first 90 days & paying the annual fee.” ""Redeem for up to 2 round trip award tickets.” They do not approve you right away so I called and told them to put the payment on the card and I would cancel the amount on the card I used since Frontier would not approve us right away which is weird since our credit is perfect.

When we arrived in Denver, it took about 20 minutes to get off the plane, followed by another 20 minutes to retrieve bags and go through customs before checking in to my connecting flight. I get to the Frontier Airlines kiosk and the agent told me I could not board the aircraft 30 minutes before departure - yet in their terms and conditions, it says that passengers are allowed to board up to 30 minutes before departure - either this agent was purposely making this experience hell for me, or was a complete idiot and had no idea how to do his job. I tried explaining to them that my flight was delayed and I had come up to the kiosk as fast as I could after having to wait through customs and baggage claim. The agent alongside him said I needed to calm down and that I was flabbergasted - no regard nor understanding to the frustration after flying 11 hours, and then being told I would not make my connecting flight and that ""it's not their fault I missed my flight"". The agent also said that they do not receive any notifications at the kiosk about delayed connecting flights, which I find absolutely absurd. They told me I needed to go speak with a manager but there was no one to be found at the moment. I spoke with Spirit Airlines next door, they said I would have to pay for a new flight if I were to fly with them - but that I could attempt asking the manager from Frontier Airlines if they could assist with that. The manager was now at the kiosk at Frontier, and her presence, attitude, and tone of voice was the worst I have ever experienced at an airport. She was extremely rude, and would not even listen to anything I tried to explain and kept dismissing every sentence without thought. She was robotic in tone of voice and did not care at all about what happened with my flight, and blamed me for missing the flight and that there was nothing they could do. I left crying out of frustration and rudeness that I experienced from that so-called ""manager"" - it's a mystery as to how someone with such a horrible attitude and personality would have that role. I had to buy a new ticket from another airline, as well as transportation and hotel for the night since they had no other flights to offer me.

The problem I had with this airline is that I was asked to check-in online and told that if I did so I would save money, especially if I bundled the options: bags, carryons, seats. So I did. Or I tried to. I am not unfamiliar with making arrangements online but had problems with navigating the site. I think I had to try three times, but at least twice, for everything to go through. I noticed that they were listing my flight as ""roundtrip"" even though it was Cancun to Denver to Seattle. The charges were astronomical. I ended up paying $254.12 at check-in on top of the $191.24 I had paid for the flight itself. And this is supposed to be a discount airline? So, at the airport I checked with the agent at the counter as I checked my one bag, total charges $86.24 instead of the accustomed $25-30. And I had to pay another $86.24 for the carry-on, which I have never had to pay for. The agent checked the record and told me that I should call Customer Service when I got home because it looked like I had been overcharged. So I called Customer Service and gave them the confirmation number so they could check the charges and I am informed that they had to charge twice because I did not have a connecting flight! What? So I asked if every other person my the flight from Cancun to Denver who then continued to a second destination had to pay the same fee for each ""flight"" and I was told that ""yes"" they all would have paid the same fees! Rather than argue I chose to pass the word around. No way I will fly Frontier again, that's for certain.

However, I am traveling without a laptop and my cellular service does not have a plan to use in the US (we live in Canada) so I immediately have an issue with the thought of trying to rebook my own flights at a moments notice. Also, I was immediately panicking because $400 is not going to get me home. We were now going to miss our connection in Denver so I would essentially be out 2 flights per traveler. But when I asked if we were going to receive $800 (for 2 flights) per traveler I was told ""Uh, I don't know."" Now I feel very uneasy. I asked the agent to help me look at flights to get us home. She said we would have to do it ourselves. Absolutely no customer service. I explained to her that I had no lap top and no cellular service so she relented and used her computer to look up flight information for me. After 15 minutes she said she could not find a flight and told me that I would have to look on my own. I asked her if there was someone else I could talk to and she said that I could use their phone to call Frontier Customer Service to which she gave the phone number. After 1 hour and 20 minutes on the phone with customer service I was rebooked on a flight with United Airlines the next evening that would get me back to Calgary. I inquired about a hotel or food vouchers now because we were now stuck in Tulsa for 32 hours with no lodging or transportation. I was informed that there would be nothing that they could do about that. I ended my call with customer service and waited for my new reservation to show up in my email. When it arrived within a few minutes I opened it only to find that yes, they had booked a flight for me but not for my child! I went back to the counter and asked the agent to verify if this was a single passenger booking (or was I mistaken) and she told me that I would need to go down to the United counter and ask them to check! I am losing my mind now. I asked the agent if she would get us a hotel for the night so that we would not be stuck at the airport for a day and a half. She said she would not be able to. At that time the gentleman who was also working there said that he would help us get a room through the airport when we returned from the United counter. My son and I walked down to the United counter to verify if the booking was for 1 or 2 travelers. As we were standing in line waiting we can still see the Frontier counter and all the lights start turning off. We stand there and watch the 3 employees gather their personal belongings and leave the counter. They walk right by us with no acknowledgement. What about helping us get a room? What about a flight for my son?",False,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tulsa to Calgary via Edmonton,March 2019,1,1,,1,3,,False,
