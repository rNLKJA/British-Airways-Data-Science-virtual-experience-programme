They first ask for a screenshot of the technical mistake, you show it to them and then they say: ""You should have called our Call centre - it\s your fault."" So by their logic I should have paid 3 EUR a minute for a call in a foreign country for the sake of their technical ""error"" ( it is a usual ""error"" their system seem to be trained to create for several customers on that flight and each of their flights as we figured out at the airport talking to fellow-passengers who were ripped off the same way on the spot).

I start feeling that they fly between the serious companies, which really respect their customers and do everything for their flights to be on time. Last experience was the last one for me choosing this unprofessional company, which have interest only for taking your money, after that you don’t matter for them. Because a redirected flight, I lost my connection to my final destination, I lost my rental car, and my hotel and I had to book a hotel in the new destination and a new flight for the next day for my final destination and another rental car. Besides that they kept us waiting in the new destination airport (which was not the plan)like sheep, while everyone asked questions about what’s happening. No one knew anything, so I get frustrated. All this coming after another flight with Wizz Air where my flight was delayed 3 hours just the day before. And the last one was when I come back after the long story.

As I didn’t find any available direct flights to Tenerife by the time of booking the tickets in April 2022. First, I booked a flight for 4 passengers from Bergen to Gdansk  with WizzAi, which is canceled by Wizzair after the planned departure time). I have booked one night in a hotel in Gdansk on 25/06/2022. Bought 4 tickets for the whole family with LOT Airlines from Gdansk to Warsaw in order to take another aircraft to Tenerife. Booked another 4 tickets from Warsaw to Tenerife through Wizz Air at the end. On the planned day we went to Bergen Airport. The departure time was at 14.05. We received a sms from Wizz Air  the flight is delayed and the estimated departure will be: 14.40, then another sms at 14.27 that the flight was delayed again and the new departure will be at 16.00, then another sms about a new delay to 16.30. At 14.47 they sent sms that the flight was canceled without mentioning the reason for cancellation. No one from WizzAir was in the airport to inform us what to do and no one called us. We went home with our kids again and tried to contact Wizz Air. After 45 minutes waiting over the phone with a paid phone call, they said that there are no other available flights, and we must send them a claim form to get a refund. I tried on my own to find another solution, and I found a flight at 22.40 to travel to another city in Poland (Katowice) where I could rent a car and drive 4 hours to Warsaw in order to catch the flight from Warsaw to Tenerife on the second day. I called them again to rebook this flight, and they assured me that everything is OK. I got the same confirmation number, I rented a car and paid online from Katowice Airport to drive with my family over the night to Warsaw as we did not find a hotel to accommodate us. We went to Bergen Airport again with our kids. The new boarding was at 22.40 on Saturday 25/06/2022, but they told us that the flight was delayed and then was also canceled without giving any reason. No one from Wizz Air was in the airport, the same as for the first time. Just those from Bergen airport gave us a paper stating our rights and they said that Wizzair will contact us, but no one has contacted us. I called WizzAir again. They couldn't find any other alternative flights, and asked me to send them a claim to get a refund and any other expense that I lost due to the two cancellations. I received a SMS at 06.00 am that the flight was canceled. (7 hours after the scheduled departure time). As a result of that , we could not travel to Poland and we missed the hotel accommodation, the flight from Gdansk to Warsaw, the car rental fee in Katowice and on top of that we missed the flight from Warsaw to Tenerife. I searched again and again and I found another route with another airline and of course the price was doubled. The original price was around 9000 Norwegian krone.

We arrived 3 hours before our flight which was not international and were almost late because of the queue. We only queued to tag our pram as we were travelling light, but there was no one to ask and it was not clear on the site. Both flights there was only one staff member for premium and one staff member for economy so either way the queue was ridiculous. Fine, we thought we had the time as Wizz Air (on both trips) had texted to say the flight was delayed. However none of the airport gate signs indicated the flight was delayed so after rushing through, skipping any sort of food with a baby we made it to the gate to leave. The airport sign actually said 'gate closing' but when we arrived there was just a lot of people sitting on the floor wondering what was going on. Eventually after about an hour an announcement that the cabin crew were in the airport was made, but no indication of how long was given.

When you are queuing for the gate and passport clearance, another 30 minutes. Then, just when you think you’ve finally made it inside the plane and ready to take off, they slap you with an additional 45 minutes delay. You get an almost 3 hours delay in what is supposed to be a 3.5 hours flight. You’d think by then at least they’ll give you free peanuts for compensation.  If they could legally monetise your complaints and suffering, I bet they would. Yet I still consider myself getting a comparatively better flight experience, compared to what other reviewers are saying here. If you’re using online check-in, make sure you pay for the £2 option for “online check in”, even if they stated that online check in will be available “for free” 48 hours before flight. If you don’t pay, the website/app will display an error on the last step of your check in. Changing browser, clearing cache, or calling the customer service won’t help you.

"""lack of action towards enforcing Covid safety""",1,2021-06-11,"I would like to make a formal complaint about the crew on the Wizz Air morning flight from Luton to Cluj from the 11th of June, regarding their lack of action towards enforcing Covid safety rules and regulations. Many of the passengers on the flight were either not wearing masks at all, or wearing them in such a way that it was neither covering their mouth nor their nose. I initially kindly asked some of the infringing passengers to properly wear the mask, to which they first ignored me and then they started making insulting comments towards me in Romanian (I speak the language so I understood what they said). When I raised this issue with members of the crew, they shrugged me off and told me that there is nothing they can do about it and that I should sort this issue. I do not believe that it is the job of passengers to enforce basic covid safety rules, and I also believe that the airline has a duty of care towards all its passengers. The incident made me feel very uncomfortable and unsafe during the entire duration of the flight. Moreover, I noticed that during the entire duration of the flight, no member of the flight crew took any measure or said anything towards other rule infringing passengers, not even when passengers without masks were passing by them on the corridor. I find this to be unacceptable, for a member of the flight crew to pass multiple infringing passengers on the corridor and not do even as much as ask them to follow international guidelines and regulations regarding safety during the Covid Pandemic.

But alas, the airline has changed! Now it feels that they are solving their cash flow problems by allowing new booking only to cancel them later, often “at the last minute” (a few hours before the flight). My flights to Moscow in June 2021 were cancelled twice, second time I was already in a hotel near the airport as the flight was very early morning, so had to come in the ending. So I lost money on transport, COVID test and hotel. My friends flight to St Petersburg was also cancelled, she opted for a refund which is promised in 30 days… Good luck with that. When they cancel the flight, they offer refund or re-book, but refund only for “new” money, not if your used credit accumulated with them during pandemic for the past cancelled flights… so I had to re-book. And since then my booking was cancelled or amended three more times within 2 days. Dates get pushed further and further away from originally booked flights, like a month and a half later. I checked availability on site prior rebooking and noticed that tickets price is 3-4 times higher than mine… so my guess is that my booking is being bumped off as they sell tickets for much higher price! Or may be they don’t intend to fly at all, just collect new payments anyway to save themselves…. In addition some add-on services are NOT refundable as it turned out, specifically “provided by partners”. Once after cancellation and request to add credit to the account I discovered that around £18 “disappeared” without explanation. I’m not sure what “service” was deducted.

Since it was planned to be a 10 days trip I accepted it, soon after that I received another email with the information that my inbound flight was moved forward one day because of ""operational reasons"". So accepting this again finally meant that my entire trip was cut down from 10 to 8 days. The next point on the downside was that after these changes I got the information that my flights were unable for online check-in. However my partner could check-in online without problems although I was the one with the so called ""priority"" status. Because of that I ended up with center seats on both sectors. I have to mention that check-in on both airports was smooth and done within 2 minutes. I also have to say that for short flights the Wizz Airseat configuration is acceptable but definitely not what you would get on premium airlines (230 instead of 200 allows an idea how tight everything is). The crew was nice and seemed to be motivated and drinks from the onboard bistro service were sold at reasonable prices. Both flights landed ahead of time and WIZZ managed the new COVID procedures very well and distributed the necessery health declarations during boarding. Would I recommend WIZZ for short flights?

The Greek Government  said that direct flights from the UK to Greece would continue to not be permitted from 1 July (they were not permitted during June, and they were thinking of allowing them from 1st July onwards, but changed their minds, and first announced that on 26th June). He also said that the official announcement was going to come out on 29th June. I didn't want to wait till 1 day before my flight for WizzAir to cancel it (and I found out from others that they ended up cancelling it on the 30th and a mere 14 hours before the actual flight), thus I tried to book another flight. In that effort, I ended up cancelling my ticket which led to the first ridiculous policy they have - it takes 72 hours for them to put the ""refunded"" money into a ""Wizz Air account"", why 72 hours? The second ridiculous policy is that after they added it I would only have 3 months to book another flight with them, otherwise they keep the money, which is ridiculously short even for pre-COVID times, it should be 12 months at least, and probably 24 or 36 now that COVID is around. I would have found that reasonable. But regardless, I couldn't wait 72 hours to book another flight with them, so I ended up booking with another company for my actual flight. Once the 72 hours passed, my money was added to the ""Wizz Air Account"", after which I proceeded to try to get a refund to one of my actual bank accounts. In that process, they ask for the reason for the refund, and they have two new options ""Cancellation initiated by Wizz Air due to COVID"" and ""Cancellation initiated by customer due to COVID"" - I picked the second option, assuming that there is a difference from a similar cancellation pre-COVID times, and thus that I would actually get a refund (otherwise what's the point of having such an option). Apparently, cancelling my flight due to COVID (a flight which was gonna get cancelled for sure by them eventually) and having bought the more expensive ticket wasn't enough to get a refund.

The flight was scheduled for 19 May 2020. Given the worldwide pandemic crisis, lockdown restrictions were set in place by the government of Romania and UK. As such, I called WizzAir customer service at the beginning of April 2020 to enquire about the flight status. I was advised that the flight was still going ahead as planned and that passengers will be informed about cancellations due to Covid19 via email (when applicable). When I asked about the notice period I was informed there is not a set notice period and it could vary from 2 weeks to next-day cancellation notice. WizzAir personnel advised me not to cancel my booking as yet and wait for further communication closer to the flight date, and that if I still wanted to cancel the flights due to the Covid19 pandemic and further restrictions inposed by government then I should do so 14 days prior to flight date to ensure I am not charged additional cancellation fees. I called customer service again on the 1st of May 2020 and I was advised the flight is still going ahead as scheduled and if I wanted to cancel the flights WizzAir will charge 60 Euros/person/flight. This is unacceptable considering the current worldwide situation, and more specifically the restrictions imposed by the government. The UK is under lockdown with no end date in sight (at the point of this complaint), which means all non-essential travel is not permitted. Additionally, social distancing restrictions are further imposed by the Romanian Government and the UK government, including 2 meters distance between people. These measures were not respected. As such, the flight should have been cancelled, in line with government guidelines. It is not acceptable for a company not to adhere to Government guidelines and put customers at risk. I find it appalling that flights are not cancelled in advance by WizzAir (given specific lockdown instructions set by the government) and that passengers are required to cancel the flights more than 14 days prior to the flight so that the cancellation fees are not increased. It is absurd to charge the cancellation fee per person per flight and not per booking, meaning that the customer receives a 10th of the price paid. Based on the information I received from the WizzAir staff, the flight cancellation period varies from 2 weeks to 1 day. This means WizzAir deliberately does not adhere to WHO and Government (country specific) guidelines and restrictions, so that they can retain most of the price paid by customers when booking flights. Aside from this blatant disregard for pandemic restrictions, the customer service personnel was rude and dismissive over the phone, with no willingness to discuss the options available for customers.

Sometimes to pass online check-in you have to select seats on the plane, but you have to pay 35 € / person. This time, because the plane was advanced one day, there were problems with online check-in. My husband and I decided to go to the airport earlier to avoid paying the fees. But there again we had to pay € 70 to print our tickets! A shame ""We understand but there is nothing we can do the service is blocked"". In addition to uncomfortable planes, barbaric schedules, absent customer service, there are delays and cancellations every time. And in the end we pay as much as a normal first class plane. Wizzair is the worst experience every time. They make every trip painful.  Wizz Air est à chaque fois la pire expérience!

When I went for help to Tirana Airport they charged us €35 euros each for check in and €20 for a carry on which was within allowance (and the same carry on we had from Luton to Tirana (only one piece as we went away for less than 48 hrs)). On the same flight, half of the passengers who had to board had the same problem as us because the website was not working. As they did not want to miss their flight they were obliged to pay. As soon as we landed I complained to Wizzair online. Next day, I received a reply just copying and pasting their terms and conditions. They did not even bother to investigate this matter, no apologies no nothing. Also no refund she wrote. I replied back saying that I do not want copying and pasting paragraphs, I want a reply from the highest manager as her email was not addressing all my points and she showed no remorse. I received a second reply next day and again it was from her (they seem to not have a manager at all). At the end she wrote the following: "" I would like to inform you that Wizz Air has exhausted its internal complaint handling process"" which shows that I should not bother them anymore and as she mentioned in her previous email again ""no refund"".

While I have nothing special to say about the onboard staff (they were neither nice nor rude, almost non-existent, I would say), I was appalled about the attitude of the Wizzair staff at the airport.

When it finally did, the number was accompanied already by a flashing ""BOARDING"" sign which put pressure on us. The gate was A17 so we followed the signs and at one point the signs indicated a direction for gates A12 - A19. Here it's when I noticed, on the side, a Wizzair staff screaming something which I could not understand so I went to her asking what is that she was saying and she was extremely rude and basically shoved us (not indicated) to another Wizzair staff (would have not been easier to put a sign akin to ""A12 to A19 except Wizzair passengers"" rather than having that rude woman screaming?"". So we went to this other person, this time a man who was checking the boarding passes and the size of the backbags without ever lifting his head and with the utmost scary expression. He sent me on one queue while my friends to another. When I asked him why, even though we were on the same flight, he sent us on two different queues, his brusque reply was: ""There is a difference, just go"".

"""bad value for money""",2,2018-11-01,"Today, I had THE worst experience of my life on Wizz Air. I arrived early for boarding so that I could find room for my backpack in the overhead compartment - which I did. I then took my row 'C' aisle seat. After boarding was completed, I was made to remove my backpack by the stewardess and force it under the seat in front of me. My backpack is large, flexible and within Wizz Air's size limits, but placing it there meant that there was no room left for my feet. (See photos). I could not place my feet outside in the corridor area, either as it would have tripped other passengers who were walking and blocked the food trolleys. I had no choice but to place my feet under the metal braces in the seat in front, meaning that every time the passenger in front moved in his seat, my foot would get crushed. By the end of the flight my foot was bruised, and I was in pain, simply because my bag was too large to fit under the seat, and it should have been left in the over head compartment. Upon pointing this to the stewardess who instigated this episode without any consideration of the consequences, she told me to write to Wizz Air and complain, and that there was nothing she could do. It may be that Wizz Air will read this and decide to reply, stating that shortly larger bags, such as the one which I had to remove mine for will not be allowed without an extra fee. However, that is not the point. At the time of my journey, this was allowed, and. Wizz Air provided zero safe foot space. My bag was also too large to fit under the seat in front, and should have stayed in the overhead locker. Additionally, as my bag was too large to fit the seat in front, it was blocking the emergency escape route of the passengers sitting in the window and middle rows. This is dangerous, and I believe against passenger air transport safety rules. There were also a couple of other, issues regarding hygiene. I noticed that the toilets were cleaned by cabin crew, without wearing gloves, using paper towels from inside of the toilets. First the seat was wiped, then the sink and finally the same towel was dropped on the floor and the floor was wiped using the shoes. The stewardess then pick up the papers from the floor using her hands and flushed them down the toilet. After this, and without washing her hand, she walked to the food trolley and started serving food to passengers, touching coffee cups, water bottles, serviettes and sandwich wrappers. This has to be the worst case of hygiene which I have ever come across, and I would not trust any food served on this airline. I also noticed that the headrests on the seats had grease marks on them, as the paper headrests were missing. The Velcro exists to hang the headrests from, but in order to save costs, it seems like Wizz Air have decided not to care about this item either. I have travelled on Wizz Air on numerous occasions in the last 10 years or so (about 10 times this year alone), however the service has reduced dramatically, the prices have any rocketed (they are often more expensive than national carrier National carriers) and the staff's attitude to customers is simply atrocious - possibly due to their fast expansion.

What I don't like about them if that they make you check-in your hand luggage most of the time, if it's a trolley. Or they charge you for letting you take it on board. This is really annoying because you always have to wait for your hand luggage at the destination. This particular flight was quite bumpy. There's very little a pilot can do to avoid turbulent weather and I am not one to be easily scared, but this time the flight experience was a little unpleasant. No concerns over safety, though, so I will keep flying with them. The worst thing of all was the boarding experience at Otopeni airport (and the overall condition of the airport).

I mean everything. If you don’t have checkin completed before you get to the airport it costs $40 to get one there so you can fly (not an exaggeration). Printing the little piece of paper costs literally as much as the airplane ticket. In addition, there website is so sneaky and tricky that they won’t send an email asking you to confirm or anything. They will make it incredible you difficult to do so they can steal some more money. I had 5 different flights on this trip from several airlines and this was the only one I could not figure out how to check in and spend $40 on that. Also expect to get charged extra if you have any extra bags at all: purse, hand bag, etc. I wouldn’t be surprised if you got charged for entering the plane with gum in your mouth. 2) Staff will treat you poorly. Aside from being charged for everything and nit pick on everything; there is no management in the building to talk to if you have an issue b/c the company is so small they have to hire an outside source at the airport. The staff treats you like criminals checking everything and looking for any little thing they can charge you with. From there you’ll be driven on a bus shuttle to the plane. Literally they are some stingy that you have to sit in the back of the bus if you are not priority. This doesn’t even matter, but it’s just that type of scroungy feel to the whole experience that makes it misserable. 3) They delayed the flight twice overall. I’ve flown about probably 10 or 15 times to places all over the world. I have had some great ones and some rough ones, but this is by far the worst. I will probably never fly with Wizz Air again and I encourage anyone else reading this review to do the same.

A few days before the flight I again went online and attempted to check in.

Since we had three bags to check-in and three bags to carry-on I paid over $170 online in order to avoid paying a higher price (as noted in the online check out info) at the airport.

I assumed I would just check-in at the airport counter and find out what seats were assigned to us by the airlines.

I do wonder if that text was to encourage people to call the premium number for some extra revenue. My plane was the one I booked, albeit an hour late. As usual, Priority passengers had their passports checked and were allowed down to the shuttle bus to the plane. All other passengers (including me) were next. I was on the same bus as the Priority passengers (who were separated from us with a red cordon on the bus) and there were a few other buses behind us also going from the gate to the plane. We waited, standing, on the bus for over half an hour before it took us to the plane. What's worse (not for me, but for the Priority passengers) is the other buses left before us so ours actually got to the plane second last!

After canceling my flight, it's almost impossible to get a response from them in order to obtain the compensation I am entitled to. At the airport, the flight seemed to be delayed somewhat. At 9:45 am I got a message saying the flight had been canceled and I could rebook another one, with no further information. I tried to get information online but the WiFi had crashed under the increasing amount of people in the airport. After waiting in line at the information desk they told me they had no information at the time, but that the airport was closed and it wasn't due to the weather. When asking why the airport was closed, she simply replied: ""I can't tell you"", hinting that she knew, but I wasn't supposed to. After waiting around around for half an hour or so, they finally announced that we were allowed to leave the airport. I asked what that entailed exactly considering they were saying the flight hadn't been officially canceled, and they said I had to sign in order to receive further information. I asked to read the letter first, but they declined. I signed and received a letter in Hungarian which nobody was able to translate for me. Next they put me on a bus and dropped me off at the departure again. I was told to get in line where I'd paid the exorbitant airport check-in fee of 35 EUR earlier. It was a huge line which was hardly budging. Due to the enormous amount of people, I spent 2.5 hours waiting in line. When I got to the front, the lady told me she had no information. When I asked if there was anyone from Wizz airlines to talk to, she said she didn't know, and I had to queue up at the information desk which had a line of similar length. I expressed my doubts that they would be able to help me there and wanted to record her telling me that I had to go to the information desk so that they wouldn't send me right back.

Bad service turned it into a very expensive (and frustrating) experience for me and my family! I traveled with my wife and two children to Romania, and we were denied boarding at the gate of the flight back from Bucharest to Israel, because of overbooking. No matter how much we argued and insisted, we were refused. I must emphasized that at any stage there was no call for volunteers to give up boarding, as the EU regulation require in case of overbooked flights, before performing involuntary denial of boarding. The staff member at the gate told us that they are missing one seat, so 3 of us can travel. We explained that we cannot split. Only after we got back to the ticket office at the departure flights counters we were told that we are entitled only for a single denied boarding, as the 3 others had seats and chose not to fly. We had to buy new flight tickets for the next day in a different airline, as Wizz Air had no seats available in the following days. These one way tickets cost us more than the entire round trip with Wizz Air (although it was with another low cost airline). We had to pay for hotel another night, meals, transportation etc. I submitted a complaint and sent copies of all required documents and receipts. It took more than a month for Wizz Air customer service to respond, and their feedback is that they are willing to compensate me for denied boarding of only a single passenger. They provided very limited compensation for the other passengers. The overall compensation Wizz Air agreed for is €984, while my overall expenses caused by this denial of boarding was €2,426. Seriously, Wizz? We know that airlines overbook the flights, but compensate properly your customers when they are harmed by it! At least reimburse the actual extra expenses caused, I am not even talking about compensation for the frustration and trouble. Follow the regulations and ask for volunteers before you perform involuntary denial of boarding! Don’t split up families! If you deny boarding from a member of a family under a single reservation, compensate the entire family! None of us wanted to stay there.

If you don't want to pay extra you can only carry a small bag at this airline, but they make that very clear even in their advertisement, so it can hardly be a surprise for anyone. What is more annoying is that you cannot choose seats at check in without having to pay extra. Consequently I was placed in a middle seat, even though the aircraft was only half full. But the person next to me moved away quickly so I could move to the aisle seat. Seat comfort was not too bad, the seatbacks could not be reclined, but being tall I find it more annoying if people in front of me recline their seatbacks without looking back. The catering on board was very uniinteresting, and for someone who does not eat gluten there was hardly anything available. But I had brought my own food, so that was not a problem. All in all the flight was pleasant enough, and even though we were a bit delayed at departure we arrived in time.

I use this route (Eindhoven to Brno) and carrier a lot, and I love it. Both airports are rather small and super convenient. You don't need to be there hours before departure, in Brno 40 minutes is enough, for Eindhoven I suggest 50 minutes when you fly in the morning. Of course, it is a low cost carrier, so there is no inflight entertainment and you have to pay for your drinks. Furthermore, you have to pay for a large hand luggage.

Measure your luggage by dimension and weight and, if in doubt, purchase it online, don't leave it for the airport. Always print your own paper boarding pass.

On the inbound flight, we tried checking in online on our way to the airport, like many reasonable people do - but found out they have created an arbitrary window that if you check in less than 3 hours before your flight, you have to pay 35 euros per person.

This is a low cost carrier and this review is based upon the understanding that you know what that means and my ratings would be lower if it was a full service airline. Having said that I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Wizz Air again. Their website makes it clear what you get with a barebones ticket. A seat and small cabin luggage. Want anything beyond that and you have to pay for it. We actually went for added check-in luggage and as this was partially a shopping trip, more allowance on the way back from Budapest. You do need to make sure you understand that 30 days in advance you can check-in for your flight. That's when you should as that will give you the best options when picking your seats. We didn't get this so had to make do with somewhat less than optional seating, but it worked out in our favour actually. So this is a late afternoon flight out of Iceland. Check-in was efficient, but when we entered the terminal many food options had closed. As it turned out when flying to Budapest so had most of the food on the plane. The plane felt new and shiny. Seats OK, you can't lean back at all. This is actually somewhat better as I found it easier to get in and out of the seatrow. Cabin staff were lovely, they look like they enjoy what they are doing and apologized for the lack of food options. But the Hungarian beer and red wine are both to be recommended. Now in Budapest check-in was again efficient and the airport is fantastic. Definitely one of the best in Europe with great variety of shopping/food options. However, the check-in to the aircraft made me feel a bit like cattle being led to the barn. But it worked. Flight back to Iceland was smooth.

They would look at your suitcase and your boarding pass, and if they didn't like what they saw, they would confiscate your boarding pass and give it to another member of staff. A group of about 5-10 of us were set aside. There, you were asked to measure your bag by putting into the bag size checker. My suitcase would fit perfectly but it was about 5cm too tall. The staff then used a measuring tape (I'm not kidding) to highlight that my bag was 5cm above their 42x32x25cm requirements for a free small cabin bag. I was travelling with my wife. She has a bigger suitcase than me, so I had paid extra for her luggage, but not for mine which is significantly smaller. Despite me telling them repeatedly that I have never paid extra with other low cost airlines such as Ryanair for either my wife's or my suitcase, that this was a daylight robbery, that I had paid for one bag already, that my suitcase did fit into their size checker, that this was very poor customer service on their behalf - they did not budge. I had to pay 45 euros to take my suitcase with me. I was appalled by this. If 5cm is worth more to them than gaining loyal customers I will not choose to fly with them ever again.

The staff at the gate or in the plane was not particular friendly, but I would not be happy working for that company and I suppose it would be reflected in my attitude. One of the stewardess seemed in a complete rush to close all the compartments, which made me nervous. There is no inflight entertainment and no wi-fi, but that is expected, I suppose.

After showing the confirmation and the email form The Customer Relations Deptartment, the airport staff issued new boarding passes to us for seats 1F and 1E and we proceeded to the security checks etc. Upon boarding we discovered that our seats 1F and 1E were taken by other passengers with the same boarding passes as ours.

Finally 25 min after they asked us to get to that desk someone arrives with no info, but a £5 voucher for food. He explains there is no Wizz representative in Budapest and he is not sure why there is a delay but thinks it's weather related. Food runs out from the upper crust as that's the only place we can use the voucher. Board changes to boarding so we head to gate. We were lucky to have managed to get some food - however, when the status changed to boarding, people were still queuing up for the voucher in the most inefficient process ever made. Once again, boarding did not mean boarding. It meant being huddled into a cold shed with no chairs, waiting for the flight to arrive and disembark. It ended up taking off over 3hrs after it should have. I was shocked with how inefficient, how uncommunicative, how disorganised Wizz Air was.

"""a good option for those on a budget""",7,2015-09-16,"Know what you're in for! I fly Wizz Air several times a year. Usually Dortmund-Gdansk but sometimes other destinations. If you're used to it and you don't expect a typical holiday flight experience, this is a good option for those on a budget. Don't think of it as a flight but more like a long distance bus ride. Here are my tips based on my experience:  Check in online, do it early enough and bring the printed ticket. If you don't they'll charge you a fortune at the airport. Don't take luggage and only one(!) small cabin bag. And make sure that your small cabin bag is soft! Many times I've seen people who had hard shell cases that wouldn't fit the steel frame at the airport by a centimeter or two. They had to pay a lot for that centimeter. Always take a soft backpack that is not stuffed to bursting point. Skip the extras like priority boarding, extra legroom or inflight snacks and drinks. My flight takes between 1.5-2 hours. Bring a book, sit, read and be the last to get in line at the gate. Why sit with crampy legs on a plane for money when it's free and comfortable right in front of the gate? And those crampy legs during the flight? I'm 193 cm tall. If I can suck it up for the duration of the flight so can you. Sitting straight to the back of the seat helps.

Not to mention when we got there, they told us 5 of us can go for sure, the other 2 passengers will be on standby because they overbooked. At this point we were already pretty annoyed, but chose to stay calm. The airport staff was not able to even help us deal with this all because they were not Wizzair staff.

Cabin bag the right size otherwise you will slow yourself (and the system) down - hold luggage meets requirements (32kg limit is the most generous of any low-cost airline I know). Check-in online, not at the airport. The ground-handling is low-rent and sometimes waiting on stairs is unpleasant (except once at Christmas when some passengers sang carols). This is one of the worst things about Wizz. But a bit better if you buy Priority Boarding. Flights often do not leave on time but may catch up in the air. The aircraft are modern, clean, and have leather seats.  I travel with Wizz Air frequently and I note small and steady improvements as time passes.

Beware, they will find every single little thing to charge you on if something isn't done properly! They closed online check in earlier than they should have - so we were charged £25 pp to have the tickets printed at the airport. For the return journey I made sure to check in the moment I arrived in Budapest to avoid this situation again. However on the return leg, as my mum's hand luggage bag was perfectly fine for the overhead compartment but too big to fit under the seat in front she was charged £40. Whilst some may say it's our fault we didn't check the requirements, we assumed as we weren't challenged about the bag going to Budapest, we wouldn't have any problems on the way back. Also - this is a Standard hand luggage bag which my mum uses around the world without any quibbles. The customer service of the Wizz Air staff was awful. Other passengers had issues with their luggage and tickets - all had reasonable excuses, yet there was no empathy from the staff at all. My 60 year old mum needed some assistance placing her bag in the locker. The flight attendant refused. I know things like this aren't compulsory but I can't help but think that when airline staff go above and beyond (or at least appear to!) - this will encourage people to fly again with them.

It did not occur to me that at that point I was not checked in! How can I pay for my carry on bag if I am not checked in for the flight? I certainly missed that option. It was a surprise when at the airport we were charged $50 per person for a boarding pass as I have apparently selected on-line check-in but did not complete the process.

I am based in Budapest and travel on business frequently. When flying within Europe I prefer to fly budget airlines - primarily Wizzair Ryanair to a lesser extent over legacy/full service carriers: 1) Wizzair flies early and late during the day allowing a full day of work at destination. Hate flying into destinations where budget airlines do not fly e.g. Zurich where the first flight from Budapest arrives after 11 am and the last one leaves at 5 pm. 2) Wizzair breaks down the difference between economy and business into specific services that you can purchase individually (priority boarding extra legroom lounge more luggage etc.). Thus you can travel effectively on business within Europe picking what you want for prices lower than economy ticket on legacy airlines. 3) They are cheap (for the most part). 4) They have some of latest bag drop-off times allowing one to start off for the airport later and time is money. Flying from smaller airports also means shorter check-in times (although sometimes offset by these airports being farther from cities). 5) Their policies actually make sense: I have no sympathy for those who wish to bring on board their wooden trunks and carpet bags on boards. They take up precious on space on board and slow down boarding. You should pay dearly for this or check them in! Also having no reserved seats encourages passengers to finish boarding fast.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,

We (party of 4) checked in a week earlier when they sent us an email and saved our boarding passes in PDF format on the ipad. As this is what we do instead of printing it and wasting paper. But they insisted that we need to print it at the check out counter. I tried using my phone to send the passes to the printer but it did not work and our flight was getting closer. They charged us $200 just to print out the passes ($50 each). On top of that one of the cabin bags was over the dimension so we had to fork out another $60 just to carry it our self on board. This I realize is my own mistake not to carefully read the dimensions they gave us assuming that it would be the same as rest of the airlines. Their allowable size is tiny and most of the people had to fork out extra as even a centimetre extra would not work.

Please check their baggage limitations when purchasing tickets - the small baggage allowance included in the basic ticket price is limited to rucksacks and very small hand luggage. The plane we were on was old and had appalling leg room for the standard seats. I am only 5ft 10 and really struggled to get comfortable in any way.

At Budapest airport a very abrasive Wizz Air employee ask to see my boarding passes and then informed me that my bags were too large and that I had to pay £70 extra for them. She had a very unfriendly attitude and there was no discussion to be had. If I wanted the bags on the plane I had to pay £70. This was almost as much as our fares cost. A very unhappy end to a nice trip away. I don't consider Wizz to be a good airline to fly with.

We were shocked to find out that we had to pay an extra £40 per person to print off the boarding pass. After getting over the shock we paid and went on our way to check in to only be stopped and say we had to put our small handbags in our carry on bags so we did. Finally trying to make our way to security we were rudely told to go back to the desk with no explanation. We were then informed that our carry on luggage was too big and we had to pay an extra £45 each not to be checked under the plane but just to take it on board with us (making no sense to me). Why pay extra for a bag that could already be taken on. Anyway by this stage we were getting close to our boarding gate opening and closing and still had to go through security fearing even more payment of missing a flight we asked if there was anyway we could get a quicker route through security they informed us it was another 5 euro each for fast track We said we would pay to only be informed that they could only take cash which we did not have. So we wait in Security line then sprint to just make our boarding gate. I have never come across such rude and unhelpful staff.

The cabin was clean and departure prompt. Arrival was ahead of schedule. Check in baggage was included in fare. There was no passport check upon boarding in Zhulyany. Zhulyany has bus connections to central Kyiv however the bus does not go up to the terminal and as a result I had to get a bus back to the airport after getting off in a village somewhere outside of Kyiv.

The gates are usually located at the further end of the airport but also this is normal for low cost and people have to anticipate this. I was only carrying one piece of hand luggage as allowed. Before my travel I checked on the website and my bag was within their allowed measurements. On the Luton airport no problem no bags were checked. On the way back however the issues started. I was pulled aside to try and fit it in their stand which appeared much smaller than the measurements stated on their website.

Wizz Air customer review,10,2014-09-14,Bucharest (OTP) - Malta (MLA) return. Very good value for money I have travelled with them a lot of times and I'm very happy to say I consider their service quite good keeping in mind that this a ULLC airline. You get what you pay for if you don't need a checked-in bag or on-board catering you don't need to spend your money on it. I have not experienced any unreasonable delay although I have travelled with them 30+ times in the last couple of years. The FA's are nice and welcoming the boarding takes place fast thanks to the small cabin bag policy and none of the seats can be reclined. The ground services are good as they use the main airport in Bucharest (OTP). Smaller airports like Treviso or Cuneo can be crowded while you are waiting to board the aircraft but this compensates with faster security checks. My best flights were from Bucharest to Madrid Barcelona Ciampino Bergamo Eindhoven Charleroi Catania Malta and I will soon travel on the new flights to Malaga and Malmo.

Wizz Air customer review,4,2014-09-06,"Flew LTN-SOF on W6 4302 26 August 2014. 21.50 dep. I did web check-in which was easy and as I was hand baggage only I could go straight to security. I had paid extra for the ""Large Hand Baggage"" and was surprised that no one seemed to be checking hand baggage sizes at the gate. They called us to the gate about 40 mins before departure. Then we stood for ages with no activity until after our Scheduled departure time and there are no seats at this gate (21) in Luton. Once boarding started it went without drama and they boarded at both front and rear steps so it was fast. I had not paid extra for Priority Boarding but was about 35-40th passenger to board so I had no problem finding a window seat or overhead locker space. The aircraft interior was clean and smart and seats comfortable enough even though they did not recline. However the seat pitch on standard seats was awful and made it very uncomfortable. I think it's a similar pitch to European charter airlines flying within Europe. We departed 30 mins late. The crew were courteous and reasonably friendly. I thought the inflight buy on board was good value. Euro 4.00 for a large (250 ml) fairly decent tasting glass of wine. (Much cheaper than in Luton airport). Despite our late departure we arrived on time. Disembarkation was swift via a one minute bus ride and then quickly through immigration and customs. Overall it was ok value for money but it was not comfortable.

Hard uncomfortable seats zero recline confined spaces miserable departure ""hall"" particularly unpleasant ground personnel all softened slightly by more pleasant cabin staff and no major delays. Last flight from Budapest to Eindhoven on 29 Aug and return following day made me decide to quit them for - almost - good. Traveled with spouse and booked their ""Large"" cabin luggage. Went to check-in area with the same trolley that I have traveled with countless times put it in the bin for inspection and got acceptance sticker affixed on it. Agent at boarding decides to verify again and overrules his colleague at check-in. According to him height is 1cm in excess and thus charges airport hold luggage fee of 70 euro but absurdly just lets us carry it with us on board. The fact that his colleague approved it was no excuse; he was the supervisor and has the power to overrule everybody. Requests to speak to his supervisor were rejected. On return flight from Eindhoven following day same trolley goes through same inspection and is again accepted without slightest hesitation. All in all I ended up paying broadly a KLM fare for a vastly inferior service. On the other hand Wizzair lost 40 to 50 legs a year between myself and my family.",False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,5,2014-08-28,We didn't expect much given that it is a low cost airline. It was much worse than we'd expected. Both of our flights (Luton to Prague and Budapest to Luton) were slightly late. We paid for priority boarding and on our return flight waited in a long queue to check our bags although we had checked in online. After we had been in the queue for 30 minutes one of Wizz Air employees told us to move to the priority queue (which was much shorter) to check our bags. We left the longer queue and when we arrived at the shorter queue a very snotty employee told us to get back to the longer queue. Once through security we stood over 45 minutes in an airplane hangar waiting to board (after the gate was supposed to have been closed). Never again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,3,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,9,2014-08-20,We flew (family of 5) from BUD to DXB. Check in was busy but efficient and we booked priority boarding and the option of buying an empty seat space for several of us ensuring we all had room. This is an excellent offer that may not be available on all flights but the option always remains to go for the exit seats which offer more space. All of the hassle we witnessed at the airport was due to passenger errors whether trying to book 35kg bags in or taking luggage on board that did not conform to the guidelines which are very clearly outlined on the website. Several passengers did not appear to know whether they had checked in online or not and complained when they were charged the airport fee- again very clearly expressed online. Overall we got way above what was expected. Easy check in good boarding onto a smart newish aircraft good seat room delightful staff without consuming time with many of the unnecessary procedures other airlines insist upon on take off and landing. The staff were helpful attentive and still serving food and drinks 30 mins before arrival. It was a very pleasant experience and we would not hesitate to use Wizz Air again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,5,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2014-08-20,Was dreading flying after reading some of these reviews. Flying between Doncaster and Gdansk and found it to be overall a pleasant experience.

At the gate we were again charged for carry on bags in spite of having receipts for payment.

Pick whatever is available as soon as you get on board. Our flight was Dubai-Budapest-Dubai. On our BUD-DWC flight they intentionally left our hold luggage in BUD. It was not lost they just bumped it off intentionally because they needed to load more fuel. Our baggage arrived after 2 days and it was very inconvenient because we had to go back to the airport to pick it up and I live 150kms away from the airport!

Having eventually got to the desk I was informed that I had actually selected on-line check-in and because I hadn't done so I was going to be charged £30 each for myself and my partner. As if the extortionate initial charges weren't enough a £60 fee was then slapped on top of it. I don't at any point whilst booking this trip did I see a ""select this and you must book on-line or you'll be charged £60"" otherwise I would have clearly adhered to this. Just obviously another money making scheme. The guy behind the counter wasn't even sympathetic/apologetic. He looked like he couldn't care less. Not only this annoyance but with reference to paying this ridiculous fee we had to get out of the queue and go and pay elsewhere only to return to the initial queue. What a palaver. Then the flight itself - small and cramped. My boyfriend is 6ft 5 so it was all round an unpleasant and expensive experience.

When flying Wizz you are truly on a budget airline but it works and you get what you pay for. We carefully read the luggage rules in advance and avoided paying extra that some of our colleague pax had to do.

Wizz Air customer review,5,2014-07-27,Flew from Luton to Vilnius return. The flights themselves were acceptable - condition of planes decent not much room in seats but I'm short so not a particular problem for me although I did hear taller passengers complaining. Lots of selling to passengers mid-flight but this is as you would expect from a budget airline. I personally did not have problems with baggage allowances but took care to read the online information carefully following the negative comments on this site. Where Wizz fell down for me was in the information provided to passengers at the airport - for both the outward and return journeys there were 60 minute delays with little information forthcoming as to why. The delay on the way home in particular was shocking - passengers were actually 'boarded' through the gate when the plane had not even reached Vilnius. This meant 200 people were kept cooped up between the gate and the runway in sweltering conditions with no access to water or WC's for an hour without any information as to why. Bad for people with kids in particular. This approach must have been taken purely for the convenience of the staff themselves - poor.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,,3,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,2,2014-07-27,We flew from Barcelona to Katowice on 7th July. Flight was delayed 4 hours due to bad weather in the morning and congestion at the airport afterwards which I understand. We were not offered any food voucher or beverages. It wasn't nice but I can afford 50 euros to buy us food (there were 3 of us). What was unacceptable was the customer service. First I had problems with my hand luggage despite me purchasing additional luggage for $160. The allowance in KG was 32kg my luggage weigh 20kg. Apparently they didn't like the size of my had luggage which weighed 3 kg as it only contained iPad travel documents and mask that I purchased in Venice. The size of the luggage is a typical suitcase for domestic flights in Australia (which btw I measured beforehand as I am very particular about things like this) which I have taken on Wizzair and Ryanair flights before without any issues. They asked me to place it into the cage and I did. It fitted except the wheels that stood above the cage. When I demanded the measuring tape to prove that the luggage is exactly the required size the Wizzair staff member raised his voice at me. I saw the arguments about the luggage before and I thought that maybe people were unreasonable but this case convinced me that Wizzair is.

The ticket price was low and great value. Both aircraft's were less than 2 years old and beautiful Flights were on time. I paid $6 extra for priority boarding which was a great value to find a good seat. I love the fact that they allow 32 kilos (about 70 lbs) and no size limit for checked baggage (cost $40).

Our flight from Naples was 5 hours late. The seats were not allocated so it was a scramble for seats in the economy class. Another issue is the allowed size of the luggage basically only a small soft backpack is accepted without an additional fee. Most of the passengers were told that their luggage is either too big or two heavy. We each had to pay additional 48 Euro for a small luggage.

I was not informed to board by the front entrance. Eventually finding my way forward I was informed that the first three rows of seats are reserved to those paying the £7.00!

In general I think Wizz Air is an ideal low cost company especially for those who prefer 100% on-line handling.

The flights are cheap especially if you join their Wizzair Club the staff are for the most part friendly and helpful although the flight staff are not always too easy to understand when using English. The seats are fairly cramped but for 2.5 hours this is not a great problem the luggage allowances need to be clearly studied but an allowance of 32kilos for hold luggage is generous. Hand luggage can therefore be quite minimal. It is always best to eat and drink before the flight as in-flight refreshments seem to be one of the ways the airline makes up for their cheap flights. Arrival and departure times are normally very close to target. My only real complaint is the long wait always experienced at the Luton departure gate always having to stand while the plane is being prepared.

The checking box for the small cabin luggage - in the airport of Dortmund - doesn't have the standard size - instead of 25x32x42 it is 24x31x41.

Wizz Air customer review,8,2014-01-21,I have flown 45 segments with Wizzair since its beginning from BUD to CRL FCO FRL GSE GYD LTN MAD MMX NYO SKG TKU TLV. I am very satisfied: the aircraft's are new clean and in a good condition the flights are almost always on time and the cabin crew is usually friendly. I always buy the extra legroom seat at the emergency exit row for a small fee (around 10 to 15 euros per flight) which also includes priority boarding - very good value as this seat is actually more comfortable than business class seats on most intra-European flights. Food is not included but you can buy snacks on board for a reasonable price. The only thing I would like as an extra service would be the option to pre-order hot meals.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,5,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2013-12-11,"London Luton to Warsaw Chopin and Return. December 2013. Arrived 15 minutes late outbound back on time. Staff were helpful and friendly. This is a classic Low cost carrier operation and you get what you pay for - the only problem with this kind of tarmac dash boarding is if you want to make sure you sit next to each other then you need to buy priority boarding. I had read other reports prior to the flight and wasn't looking forward to it but the experience was much better than I thought it would be. I think the problems on these airlines are caused by people who don't abide by the rules and expect a full service airline product on a low cost carrier. They do have two baggage sizes for cabin baggage and they do enforce it - measure your bag before you go to the airport and accept if its not ""small"" you will end up paying for it. I would recommend and I would use again.",False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,10,2013-12-09,My family and I travelled Turku-Gdansk on Dec 4th and Gdansk-Turku on Dec 6th. I have only positive feedback to give to Wizzair. Cheap flights (GDN-TKU only 9.99€/passenger). FA friendly and very aware of security issues. Of course you get what you pay for. On GDN-TKU we actually paid more for one piece of luggage (15) than the cost of one passenger ticket. Flight to GDN on time. GDN-TKU took place on the day winter storm Xavier hit Poland so we really didn't know what to expect. However the flight took off about 30min delayed and landed in TKU almost on time. We believe that our WizzAir flight must have been one of the few flight that managed to take off almost on time in Gdansk that day. No worries about security during take off either. Over all our WizzAir experience was better than we expected before our travel.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,5,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,3,2013-11-29,Luton-Warsaw return. Outward was OK. I'd read the cabin baggage conditions and taken the - minute - briefcase that fitted the size regulations. The FA's were competent. But the seats are the most uncomfortable I have experienced in 45 years of air travel. No legroom (at 1.88m I'm not that tall) but also slippery leather surfaces no back support and absolutely excruciating seat cushion. I had to keep getting up and walking up and down the aisle to relive the pain. Return was less OK. Boarding ground staff were clearly incompetent. Kept starting one thing then stopping and doing something else. Spent 15 minutes arguing with a young mother and her baby. No information on why delayed or for how long. finally loaded onto a bus and left on it for 50 minutes before finally getting to the plane. Plane was 40 minutes late; no explanation no apology.

Wizz Air customer review,10,2013-11-29,My most recent trip with Wizz was yesterday and there were no delays and no problems and got to travel for a very low fare from Bucharest to Eindhoven. This is definitively the best airline in terms of value for money. It is truly a low cost airline with rates as low as 19 euros from Bucharest to Eindhoven. I'm a student and therefore low budget. I've been flying with them for over 3 years now and never had problems. Since Wizz started operating it definitively helped me afford more trips.

Wizz Air customer review,,2013-11-21,You may think it is a cheap flight - but they rob you blind in unseen extras. We arrived at Luton - with 2 carry on bags - 3 hour delay - which was caused by Wizz Aircraft being called to do an extra flight? So we decided to check our luggage in - so we didn't have it for hours in the departure lounge - £56 per bag. The flight makes a coach on the M25 feel luxurious! Buy this buy that. Return flight - 20 mins late. Check in via a pre desk with card machines at the ready. Did you check in on line? Yes - but it would only let 1 person check in online. Sorry - you will have to pay 30 euros per person for not checking in online. Your carry on bag is counted as large - you will have to pay 45 euros for carry on!

I arrived at the airport without web check in and had to pay 20 euros. On my return home there was also difficulty. I have travelled with Wizz Air many times in the past and find them excellent value for money - but am wondering if web check in has purposefully been made difficult recently so as to get people to phone the very expensive help line.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,3,,,5,,True,

I read the negative reviews and was a bit nervous but everything turned out fine. You get what you pay for. Yes there is no leg room (I'm 195cm tall) the seats aren't the greatest. We found it strange that the only way to take bags for free was if you took a small backpack so that's what we did. If you follow their rules you'll have a no hassle experience. Outbound flight was on time and return flight landed 10 minutes ahead of schedule. FA's worked hard and responded quickly when other passengers were seeking assistance.

Wizz Air customer review,4,2013-11-14,Doncaster to Vilnius. OK it was very cheap but turned out to be very uncomfortable before we had boarded the aircraft (which did leave on time thank goodness). I have two main issues: We had booked priority boarding because we were a party of 5 with a baby of 1 year and wanted to sit together. We found that in practice this meant we could stand at the head of the boarding queue with a restless baby for about one hour. Departure gate staff made no attempt to deal with this by for example getting passengers to sit down until boarding was imminent or announcing that priority boarders could jump the queue when the gate was opened. I subsequently complained to Wizzair about this and they confirmed that priority boarding meant nothing unless present at the front of the queue at the time of boarding. It is true the flight was uneventful and extremely cheap so I have not rubbished them completely.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,3,,False,

Wizz Air customer review,1,2013-11-10,Donetsk- Luton. This flight will make me think twice next time I may book with this airline. Once the boarding was completed we started to see the captain and two engineers coming back and forward from the flight deck. One hour later passengers were disembarked due to a technical problem. One hour later the flight was cancelled and an airport assistant said us that Wizz had no local assistance in the airport. However she would have tried to provide assistance booking in a local room. I phoned to Wizz Air customer service the phone call is chargable and four minutes cost me £4.82. The Wizz assistant said that I had two options ask a ticket refund or wait until Wednesday (three days from the flight cancellation) for the next available flight. She said that there was no guarantee of a full hotel refund. I decided to take a train overnight and go to Kiev where more flights were available. In spite the situation Wizz Air in Kiev refused to bring me in the next flight Kiev-London available in 5 hours and asked me the full cost of Euro 200.00 which I refused to pay. The airline then replied to my refund request stating that they fall within the EU regulations for some passenger rights and under the Ukraine regulations for other things like ticket refunds. So I need to ask the refund to Wizz Ukraine which I got two weeks later. The lesson learnt is that there are hidden costs which can surface when things get wrong. The entire return travel costs me Euro 285 more than planned.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,,2013-11-06,I have travelled with Wizz Air a few times. I can remember only one flight which left and arrived on time. My last flight with them was a nightmare.

As I had to get back to work the next day I re- routed with a different airline. Wizz air refused to refund ticket. I will never use this airline again.

No problems getting on/off the planes with unreserved seats. Both planes newish and clean. Cabin assistants did a great job especially with families politely asking singles to move in order to keep late boarding families together. Only gripe is Wizzair are inconsistent with baggage sizes. Some people being asked to pay for oversize baggage others with clearly oversize bags going through. A baguette drink and 4 bar kit-kat costs only £5 on board. Seats are a bit close but at £50 a seat fantastic value for money. Would definitely use again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,

Seats rather cramped but bearable for a 2.5 hour flight. Boarding is a bit of a scrum at TGM not helped by 2 large Romanian men who seemed intent on blocking the aisle so that they could sit where they wanted. Did not use refreshment facilities. Have flown this route twice and will use Wizzair again. You need to keep checking the booking process to make sure you get what you want not what they want you to have.

In fact when you book your flight you have an option to add a large cabin bag for around 10€fee but and curiously here when you make your booking through Edreams you aren't given the option to add the large bag.

Wizz Air customer review,3,2013-09-11,"I have flown Wizzair many times and each time I book again only because they are generally the cheapest airline on the Luton-Warsaw route. If I could walk I would rather do that than fly with them. The seats are without a doubt the absolute worst seats of any airline I have every flown on and I have been on a few. Occasionally I have had one of their aircraft with acceptable seat pitch but they seem to be fewer these days and unless you are shorter than your average 9 year old you will find the legroom horrendously uncomfortable. It seems incredible to me that its actually legal to force people to sit with so little legroom. Cabin crew are not overly friendly and English is not well spoken generally. The safety announcements are almost impossible to understand in English if you are unfortunate enough to be taking your first ever flight with them. Saying all that I have yet to be delayed on one of their flights so can't complain about that.

We had 1 booked suitcase going to Prague and we needed to carry 2 booked suitcases to come back. We had to pay an extra 65 Euros at the airport to add 1 booked suitcase.

The delay was caused as explained by the pilot due to a hole found in the plane that needed patching up”- surely due to a technical fault would have done!

Also as others have pointed out it would seem they are only interested in charging those with ridged suitcase style bags that would poke out of the top (I think the measurements were 40x40x40cm). I had a backpack on that was bigger than the size tester but was beckoned on through and not charged. One of the first of our party to get charged paid cash and was charged more than those paying by card etc. The staff were thoroughly miserable and who can blame them when they are forced to charge 80% of passengers who can fly out of the UK with a certain size back but not back? I don't think I have ever heard so much shouting and swearing and quite frankly I don't blame them at all.

They made us and others pay £30 for a carry on that fitted in the small container but stuck out about 2cm at the boarding gate when others who also had small baggage allowance were not singled out.

Luckily I had the reservation number with me and they admitted me to their flight without any apology for their mistake. to the contrary I got scolded by the check-in supervisor for complaining about their service. The fact that I had bought a ticket did not automatically guarantee me to get on the flight according to her.

Departure hall was in chaos. Lines were not moving and there were hundreds of passengers there. Ground staff would call out a destination name and everyone would push and shove and shift forward. A staff member led us to a check in desk where she promptly turned her back on us and we stood in the queue for another 10-15 minutes. Then told that the Skopje flight closed '8 minutes ago'.

Wizz Air customer review,8,2013-07-21,LTN-OTP / TSR-LTN. LTN-OTP on new A320. However Wizz Air urgently needs to restructure their boarding system at Luton people were pushing and shoving and there was a lot of confusion and mis-communication as to where we were supposed to line up. I think Wizz Air would benefit from establishing a seat allocated boarding system like Easyjet as this would put an end to the 'free for all' pushing and shoving issue. If you travel through Luton there are delays to almost every flight there are far too many Wizz Air flights leaving and arriving at the same time and as such this airport cannot cope with the huge surge in early morning traffic. Cabin crew were helpful as always. As usual there is now very little seat pitch on their latest A320's so you might want to consider paying for an extra leg room seat as there is virtually no room for your legs. TSR-LTN: Flew back to Luton on a new A320 as on outboard flight. The way boarding was handled in Timisoara was noticeably better than we experienced in Luton. Departure was on time and like before the crew were excellent. All in all Wizz Air is a good low cost airline much better than the likes of Ryanair and we will definitely continue to fly with them on our future trips to Romania. It's a real shame that they have chosen London Luton Airport as their main UK base I seriously hope that they will consider flying from Stansted Airport in future.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,7,2013-07-21,BUD-VAR-BUD. Ground staff at Budapest were quite ignorant or downright rude but if everything checked out with You You could pass them without a word. I have to say that the new cabin luggage policy is only a way to get more money out of the passengers. Once we got onto the plane it was alright. BUD-VAR was on time the aircraft was clean and fairly new. The prices for onboard services were reasonable and I enjoyed the flight. On the way back there was a 25 minute delay and the aircraft was older with less legroom but still a nice flight.

No one from Wizz was there to say sorry or even offer a free bottle of water. Eventually people from the sub contractors turned up who refused to take any ownership for the delay. The airline knew there was a problem with the plane but simply lied about it at check in presumably to avoid any requirement to give us anything in the way of compensation. On the plane the captain made a nice speech apologising for our treatment but this did not extend to giving us so much as a free drink. Bottom line is that Wizz seems to do everything so cheaply that there is no- one to help if anything goes wrong with your flight. I would try and avoid Wizz in the future. Really not worth it unless absolutely unavoidable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,2,,False,

Flights were on time in both directions and were promptly boarded with the minimum of fuss. We found the baggage allowances adequate and staff were not checking other than a few people who were obviously over the limit. We had paid for priority boarding which worked very well and extra legroom although the standard legroom looked perfectly adequate. If I was travelling alone I probably wouldn't bother with either.

We were confused about the carry on requirement and our one bag was too large good on any other airline but a 30 expense on this airline in addition to the earlier cost. They provide nothing in the 2 hr flight without you having to pay no water no peanuts nothing unless you pay. The seating was the most cramped we have ever experienced with some spacious seats in the middle and you guessed it you have to pay extra on the spot for those seats also. Overall a regrettable experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,10,2013-04-18,I flew from Warsaw to Budapest and back. The ticket was cheap less than 20 EUR for both ways. The attendants were friendly and the flight was on time. Altogether good quality for a reasonable price I felt no difference in quality compared to many legacy carriers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,,,5,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,,2013-04-16,Waited all day in departure airport with 'Delayed' message showing and no explanation. Then 'Cancelled'' appeared at 6pm and still no one from Wizz Air to explain. Eventually asked to pick up luggage and queue up at Menzies desk. After 1 hour queuing we were told by them to use our own phones to rebook if we wanted to get on next day's flight as their computer was 'down' No one there from Wizz Air to organise or apologise.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2013-04-14,Regular on MXP-BUD-MXP route. All the journey apart from one leg were on time. The aircraft's are quite new and clean. If you're lucky you can get the plane with slim seats: it will entitle you to a decent legroom otherwise with the old ones is simply inhuman. In my opinion that's the only bad point of this airline. The rules about hand luggage are not easy but once familiar is possibly to cope with. The ground staff in this respect in MXP are very tolerant while in BUD are strict and rude. If booked in advance the fares are really good and the overall service is acceptable and better than Ryanair's. Let's say if you go for a low-cost is impossible to expect a high-class level and Wizzair falls under this scheme.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,5,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,5,2013-04-04,Oslo (Torp) - Vilnius - Oslo (Torp). Wizz is a typical low cost. You get what you pay for and nothing else. We chose to pay extra for XXL seat - and had lots of space. Crew was nice enough - but their English was a bit below standard.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,3,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2013-03-05,EIN-BUD-EIN trip. Good steady flights which were on time only the flight to Budapest was slightly delayed because of military traffic inbound for Eindhoven. Cabin crew was good legroom was sufficient for 2 hours but for longer flights to cramped. We choose Wizzair because of it's good price and for the money was worth it.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,,2013-02-13,Luton-Gdansk. I'm 6'4'' and found that I couldn't fit in the seat as they are spaced too close together. I brought this to the cabin crew attention and paid £10 x 2 for my Girlfriend and I to move seats. On return trip I was stopped at gate by staff as my bag (cabin approved) was oversize and would have to pay £30. I explained that I had just flown out 2 days previous and had no problem with my bag size. She was rude unapologetic and robotic in her manner. After paying she handed me my receipt without so much as a thank you or sorry for any inconvenience. I sat twisted in the cramped seat with my right leg out onto the walkway. There was no way I was giving them another penny for extra leg room and to top it off the announcement at the start of the flight stated that 'our passengers comfort is our priority during this flight'. Definitely not value for money with all extras added.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,10,2013-02-08,Our first flight with Wizzair from Skopje to Memmingen and all was correct there was no delay. Food was just for sale but for a normal Price. Flight staff were very friendly. We can recommend.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,9,2013-01-17,BEG-BSL-BEG. At first I thought the booking is somewhat odd with all the different fees but once you get the hang of it it's ok. The plane was 1 hour late outbound due to very cold weather and de-icing. I didn't really mind at the price we paid we were ready to wait. The flight back was smooth. All in all except the seat comfort I like Wizz.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,5,,,5,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,9,2013-01-15,LTN-BUD-LTN. Booking and web-check in were very simple adding options such as extra legroom were easy to do the plane looks heavily used but clean and we were early approaching Budapest and only late into Luton because of snow of which the pilot forewarned us about. Inflight service was friendly and helpful at both airports you have to jump through more hoops than a normal carrier but pay the correct fees and you'll get an easy and trouble free flight. I'd recommend the extra legroom seats (which means automatic priority boarding) which are held by a stewardess until take off.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,5,2013-01-15,"LTN-PRG-LTN return January 2013. Plane clean and tidy. Legroom very tight and I'm only 5'9"" - my legs touched the seat in front so must be hell for anyone taller than me. Outward flight landed early. Experience similar to other low-cost airlines. Agree with others that hand-luggage policy is draconian. Website charged us twice for bags during check-in and it is likely to take a long time to get the money back. Staff at Luton refused to help. On-board staff OK but I'd avoid buying the Romanian wine on offer if I were you - pretty vile. Return flight fine but delayed because of weather at Luton. Not their fault and the captain provided good updates. Mixed experience overall but I'd avoid in future as they aren't actually that cheap when you've totted up the overall cost.",False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,3,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,4,2013-01-07,Beauvais - Gdansk - Beauvais. Airport is far from Paris and difficult to get to. Very strange requirement for visa check for non-EU nationals (you have to present yourself to the check-in desk). Outbound flight was an hour late with no excuse from staff inbound flight 15 minutes late. Staff are generally rude and unfriendly. Would avoid in the future.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,2,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,6,2013-01-03,Impeccably clean plane. Left Prague early and arrived 25 minutes early in Luton. Crew efficient but seat pitch / leg room horrendous for someone who is over six feet and luggage policy is draconian. However excellent value for money but why can't they allocate seats to avoid the boarding scrum.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,5,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,7,2012-11-29,Warsaw-Liverpool. A decent enough plane flight took off on time and service was brisk and efficient. My only gripe was the seating which is totally inadequate for people over six foot fortunately this was a short flight. I will pay for extra legroom next time!,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,6,2012-11-29,Luton to Budapest. On the way out all was fine apart from the smallest legroom I have ever encountered on a plane. However on the return leg things were different. All seemed to be going very well they started checking us in an hour before the departure time and we went down to the busses for boarding (or so we thought). However we were crammed into the bendy bus. We were crammed in like sardines with small children and parents all mixed in. It was dark and cold outside and they kept us cooped up in there for over 30 mins. Away we went without a hint of explanation let alone an apology. I can only assume the way Wizzair have got round their debacle with the airport is to use their busses as waiting areas prior to boarding. It was a shame really because the other parts of the flight were perfectly acceptable and the cabin crew fine.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,5,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2012-11-26,LPL-VNO. Boarding was similar to Ryanair's and on time. Aircraft clean and seemed to be very new however the seats were very thin and I could feel the tray table behind me (bit uncomfortable and irritating to be honest). Staff very professional but spoke to me first in Lithuanian on both legs this did annoy a few English speaking passengers. Menu prices very reasonable regular flight deck announcements and no pre recorded announcements everything done by the crew except the audio safety demonstration. Again I had great difficulty understanding the English. Was worried about the small bag allowance but didn't have a problem with my bag with the larger dimensions however I was checked at Liverpool and it did fit when squashed into the stand. Both flights on time fare reasonable and aircraft immaculate what more could you want from a flight?,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,,2012-11-08,Sometimes cheaper than other options but do take care by the time you've added the extras they might not be. My flight to Barcelona was delayed 4 hours due to a fault with the plane. By the time we arrived public transport had ended and we were stuck with either a hotel bill or hefty taxi bill. All they offered was 30€ in vouchers towards another Wizz Air flight but you can imagine I'm not too keen on taking the risk of being dumped again! Saving probably isn't worth the hassle.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,3,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,1,2012-11-08,Larnaca to Budapest. Our cabin bags were checked by WizzAir staff on checkin as well as check in bags. They confirmed our cabin bags were suitable weight and size. When we're about to board they told us they weren't suitable and had to pay 60 Euro cash or we couldn't board. Emailed WizzAir to complain and they take an unacceptable amount of time to respond. By packing so many people into the plane the legroom is uncomfortable and there isn't enough space for each persons cabin luggage to go into the overhead compartment. Works out 5 bags for each 9 seats. A cheap flight ends up being expensive when you add in the bags for checkin and the payment charges as well as the booking charges. Save your money and go a proper airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,,2012-10-25,Beauvais to Warsaw Modlin and 20 min before landing we were re-routed to Gdansk. The fog was not their fault. However upon arrival there was no one to give any information. Finally they announced they were going to bus everyone to Warsaw giving no option to anyone. I was with a disabled person who could not take the bus. The plane flew back empty to Warsaw the day. I had to reschedule my flight and was charged 150 euros for a 14-min call and pay full fare for return flight. Never fly with this company. Beware.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,9,2012-10-24,VNO - LPL. Waited 45 minutes with 150 other people at the bottom of a flight of stairs after boarding isn't something myself or other passengers enjoy luckily I managed to sneak in front of a few passengers upon actually boarding the A320 itself. Onboard absolutely no complaints friendly cabin crew and a smooth flight. Would use again if going to VNO.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,7,2012-10-23,Gdansk - Turku. I recognise all the comments here about the rigid enforcement of the baggage rules but at the end of the day this is the flipside to cheap fares. Its getting worse now with fees for cabin baggage Wizz are apparently the first European airline to do this. For this one hour flight I really couldn't fault Wizz Air the seats were a lot more comfortable than Ryanair. It was just a regular low cost flight as far as I am concerned. My one gripe is that the online check in on their website is very confusing and the boarding pass looked rather unclear. It doesn't give you a great deal of confidence in the airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,5,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,2,2012-10-23,I travelled from Bourgas/Luton 2 weeks ago on what seemed like a new plane. It was the most uncomfortable ride I have had on a plane. The seats did not recline and you were sat upright all the time. The leg room has been cut down they have done away with then recess to put your bits and pieces in and the food tray has no dip for a drink consequently drinks are sliding about all the time and you are forced to hold it in your hand. The seats were not made of fabric but some kind of leatherette material and were hard. All this I presume is to get a few more seats in and make more money.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,,,2,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,1,2012-10-12,Luton to Budapest. Aware of the draconian application of the carry on dimensions I measured mine and it complied. Boarding was announced only to be followed by ground agents walking the line and selecting many to fit their bags into the 'box'. I made it with a firm boot but was disgusted to witness an elderly lady failing by a minimum margin. We all helped with plastic bags and someone found a bin liner. Result - lady lost her bag but the PR for Wizz was appalling. Note that they have now changed their baggage policy which is full of anomalies with different dimensions apparently qualifying as 'free' as well as a myriad of complications. Be warned- this is a money making scam. Good news is that I have booked another flight to Budapest with easyjet and it was cheaper!,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,,3,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,5,2012-10-08,VNO to LTN. The flight departed 6:10am in the cabin there several misbehaving passengers. Despite the warnings from flight attendants several men were getting drunk during the flight. They brought their own drinks onto the plane and were loud and disturbing. They verbally abused flight attendants. Sad thing is that the crew did not take it seriously and did not take it further to police in LTN. I understand that such actions would have caused delays for the airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,1,2012-10-07,"We fly often with Wizzair and this is purely and simply on the grounds of cost - it is the cheapest currently available. As an airline it has a truly dreadful attitude to its customers and deserves to go bust which it no doubt will in due course. A couple of examples: 1. Wizzair has routinely texted passengers warning them to arrive ""at least three hours"" before their flight ""due to congestion"" at the airport in question. This has always been untrue and merely a ruse for the company's convenience. My wife and children unwise to the deception arrived three hours before an early morning flight from Warsaw to Luton in early January and found the airport was not even open and they had to sit outside in the freezing temperature for two hours. 2. The hand luggage rule is being applied in a manner which can only be described as inhuman. On a recent flight from Warsaw-Modlin to Luton many passengers were forced to leave whole cases behind rather than pay the draconian penalty fee for being few centimetres oversized. The Wizzair staff were curt and rude and entirely indifferent to their plight. As soon as a cheap alternative becomes available we will leave this nasty little airline alone.",False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,2,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2012-09-24,VNO - SVG. Very cheap fare. New and clean aircraft. Friendly and efficient staff. Onboard advertisement a bit bothersome but fair enough the fare considered. Arrived 20min ahead of schedule. Will definitely fly Wizz Air again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2012-09-17,Luton to Warsaw Modlin. £29 for my ticket including taxes on time departure but the usual departure scrum and panic to board. Surprisingly easy to get from Modlin airport to Warsaw centre by taxi even at an extra 130 zloty on the flight price (£25). A decent low cost service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,3,2012-09-17,I had two passable trips with them in the past but they are getting worse and worse. Now you have to pay a charge for payment itself - be it credit card or bank transfer or payment at their own airport office. The cabin luggage dimensions are treated extremely strictly - 3 cm more depth at the bottom of my trolley suitcase was the reason for forcing me to check it in. But what really crossed my red line was the minimum distance between the seats on the flight from Glasgow Prestwick to Warsaw - taller people had no room for their legs only the really slim ones could open their tables in full and any movement out of/back onto the seat was a fight. Considering that with the charge for check-in luggage and all other fees the tickets bought two months before the flight were EUR 180 pp I really don't see the sense of using such a carrier in future.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2012-09-17,LTN-CLJ (and back). Now I read a lot of reviews on Wizz Air and was very reluctant to travel. However having travelled to Cluj and back this weekend with them I have to say I was wrong to doubt. For everyone who complains about the luggage charges can I suggest they read the conditions carefully. They are very clear about the size of luggage. I booked priority boarding and extra leg room. Boarded fine got the seats plenty of room. Plane pushed back on both trips dead on time and left without a hitch. Ok the cabins are low cost and no frills - don't expect more but the staff I found to be smart highly presentable professional and assertive with customers who tried to pull a fast one with the seating. I cannot complain at all. I'd fly with them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,1,2012-09-16,On today's flight from London Luton to Budapest (the same carry on that was fine from Budapest to Luton) which is always used for travelling seems like because the plane wasn't full got charged 52 Pound each so for two people it coasted 104 Pound. Not the way to make up many for the empty seats better service and even treatment helps.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,1,2012-09-06,I was lucky it was on time but I've heard horrible stories. Flew to Riga be careful about boarding at Luton they make you pay for any hand luggage even though mine seems to fit for Easyjet and Ryanair. I would not fly them again they charged me in total 90 pounds extra. Just spend some extra pounds on a proper airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,7,2012-08-30,Flights to and from GDN on time aircraft reasonably clean. Typical LCC with à la carte service. One has to be careful when booking required extras then check-in and baggage procedures are absolutely hassle free. Legroom for me (I'm 1.95m) non existent but I knew what to expect and it was bearable on a 1.5hr flight. The only negative aspect: The on-board announcements of the flight crew were utterly incomprehensible. Even knowing the phraseology and having no problems understanding English I hardly understood more than a couple of words. All in all not the most pleasant in-flight experience but well worth the money.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,9,2012-08-28,LTN-TSR-LTN. Both flights on brand new airbus A320 aircraft. Boarding was quick and efficient on the departing and return flight and cabin crew both ways were helpful and attentive. I found their seating reasonably comfortable far better than Ryanair's but the thing that really lets Wizz Air down is the incredibly tight leg room slots which are actually tighter than Ryanair's. All in all the experience was very good and efficient both flights departed on time and arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule. I will definitely continue to fly Wizz Air for their good service reliability and cheap pricing.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,7,2012-08-28,Luton to Katowice return. We had no problems and flights were on time. I booked priority and in both cases it actually meant something and our boarding was smooth and unrushed. Beware that some staff are extremely picky about the size of hand luggage. Mine including wheels was measured carefully before I left home and was well within the dimensions on the website. Yet it didn't fit inside their measuring gauge at the airport. I was lucky and got away with it but others didn't.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,6,2012-08-21,London- Cluj. Flight cheaper than any other flight by quite a significant amount on time direct and baggage was quickly distributed onto reclaim after. Food was much cheaper than other so called budget airlines and magazine much more interesting.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,1,2012-08-14,"Beware the hand luggage ""container"" is smaller than Ryanair and EasyJet. Totally inflexible with regards to changing flights. Legroom has to be worst in it's class. Cabin staff rude. Will never fly with them again.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,5,2012-08-12,Check-in at Budapest airport takes forever even with a printed boarding pass. You must check in with only the agent handling your particular flight.

Once we got on the plane everything was fine.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,

Web check in down on the return but got a text saying I could check in at airport with no charge. No problems there. Return flight departed early and arrived 20 minutes early which was a bonus.

Wizz Air customer review,3,2012-07-24,Turku-Gdansk with the return leg being delayed 9.5 hours. Initial delay was for 5 hours and then we came back to check it was told it would be still hours longer. Flight left at 01.10 in the end. Only 4 euro coupons were available but only on request.

The worst customer service ever.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,1,2012-07-01,London Luton - Belgrade return. The airline kept changing the days of travel (not just the times) 'for commercial reasons' which was very inconvenient and cost me lots of extra money in terms of hotel and other related travel expenses which I can't get back. My advice would be to steer well clear. A nightmare of a company - you don't know whether you're going to get where you've booked with them (or get back).,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,5,2012-06-25,I travel regularly between Luton and Kiev. Since transferring destination airports from Borispol to Zhulyany the trip has been made so much more convenient and cheaper to get from airport to the centre of town. WizzAir has a long way to go in terms of customer satisfaction - it has appalling customer support it hides costs on its web site the aircrew seem to have to undergo a humour bypass to get their jobs. They cannot always speak sufficiently good English to give an effective safety demonstration when on-board they are very rigid regarding printing boarding passes and in Luton at least appear paranoid about the size and weight of hand luggage (the Kiev end was far better). All in all it is not a pleasant stress-free experience travelling with them but will I use them again? Yes until the new international terminal at Zhulyany airport gets spoiled by too many passengers or another better airline starts flying into Zhulyany. Then I might be able to avoid travelling from Luton which I dislike intensely.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,7,2012-06-24,LTN-BRQ return. I am very happy with Wizz Air. Flew many times with them to and from Brno. Crew always smiling and happy.

I was impressed by this service from a low cost airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2012-06-11,We travelled from Luton to Targu Mures in Romania. It is a must to purchase priority check-in/seating. The queue at the regular check-in counter at Luton was unbelievable for 6am on a Sunday morning. Priority check-in allows you to go to a separate queue that is much shorter. Staff were friendly and efficient. Make sure that you only have one piece of carry on luggage. My wife and I both had a carry on bag and smaller hand bag each. We had to stuff the smaller into the larger. You must ensure that your carry on bag fits within the specified dimensions. We witnessed one poor fellow whose carry on case was within the specified dimensions except for the small wheels. He was made to pay the 50 Euro excess. Boarding was speedy - the aircraft appeared to be brand new - the inflight service ok - the flight was smooth and the exit in Romania was uneventful. Overall recommended but watch for the traps.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,4,2012-06-10,With Internet check-in baggage drop was fast and easy. Boarding pass given. Departure was about on time. FA all unsmiling. One guy's occupation seem to be wholly to prevent people from sitting on the exit row - 10 euros more if you want to sit here. Flight announcement in English was in a rapid staccato tone which delivered little information. If I didn't know better I'd think that knocking on the metal part of the seat causes the life-jacket to pop out.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,2,2012-05-10,LTN-BUD-LTN. I was very unfortunate to try and travel with this airline for a one-night family visit to Hungary. Flight delayed almost 7 hours. 3 completely different types of information given by arrogant ground crew misleading passengers. Refusing to take any responsibility and giving an 8 pound voucher Wizzair has declared the situation solved. An additional issue was a drunk passenger admittedly not the airline's fault who had to be taken off the plane adding another 45 min to the delay. I was 'lucky' just to travel to BUD but many people with small children wanted to travel onwards but with no option at 00.30 am. Wizzair did not have any solution ready for these passengers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,9,2012-05-01,Charleroi (Brussels-South) to Belgrade - one way. I got a very low priced from the somewhat inconvenient airport just north of Charleroi which I booked a little less than 2 weeks before. The order in which passengers boarded was a bit confusing and the person ahead of me had a bag that was too big - he wasn't asked about it or charged. The seat was tight and there was no regular pouch in the back of the seat in front of me to put things in. Fortunately there was no one sitting in the 2 seats beside me so I still had plenty of room. The flight itself was on time with a professional and friendly multilingual crew. All in all a positive experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,9,2012-04-15,I fly LTN-Riga on a very regular basis and always use Wizz Air. Never had any punctuality problems airline staff always polite and friendly and planes are modern and clean. Website is clear and easy to navigate although communication possibilities could be improved - I looked for somewhere to submit a compliment and could not find anywhere suitable. Only complaints are that the range of sandwiches could be improved and for regular fliers would be helpful if the passenger information could be retained within the system and not have to be re-entered each time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,4,2012-04-10,LTN-WAW-LTW. I am only 1.81m and I am struggling to get in the seat. One could argue that you get what you pay for but this was not even a cheap flight since it was around Easter. I would rank Ryanair and Easyjet to be higher in the comfort section. For the rest it was okay staff seem friendly although I was annoyed that £5 equals to €5. The worst was that twice we had to wait over 30 mins for our luggage after landing.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,5,2012-04-02,LTN-BUD-LTN. Poor website difficult to navigate and misleading headline pricing which is subject to numerous add-ons.

Wizz Air customer review,2,2012-04-02,Very little leg room. Unable to check-in online as a result we were forced to check-in at the airport for which they charged us 14 EUR each.

Wizz Air customer review,9,2012-03-06,BCN-SOF-BCN. Having flown a couple of times from Sofia service is good for the price you pay and the relatively long trip (approx 3 hours). Flights were delayed because of the snow but at least we were taken to the final destination. Cabin crew polite and managed to smile.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,9,2012-02-20,Luton-Prague return. Planes were in very good condition and inflight service prices were in line with what you pay in an airport terminal rather than being extortionate. We'd booked the priority boarding option and this was worth it to ensure seats within the first 4 rows of the door. If prices were right I'd definitely consider for future flights.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,9,2012-02-11,In the past I have been very nervous of flying 'budget' airlines. Just come back from Prague flight out slightly delayed but bearing in mind there was snow and fog forecast that was not surprising. Air crew smart polite and friendly. The plane was clean and well maintained. If I had to make one criticism on our returned flight the chief Stewardess was not English and was extremely difficult to understand her.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,7,2012-01-31,Luton-Gdansk. We are regular passengers 3-4 times annually. Aircraft's are good and generally punctual: Luton check-in staff OK. New seating configuration is awful for anyone over 1.83m but the rigid backs avoid having one's neighbour's head in one's throat! Flight attendants very courteous and helpful but passengers might find things even better if they simply speak English more slowly. Very good value for selective travel arrangements.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,10,2011-11-29,KTW-DTM-KTW. Very quiet and new looking planes enough space on both flights. On time even though we had to stay in Katowice for 20 mins because the airspace was busy. Very nice Cabin Crew both pilots spoke to us on both flights we had seats in row 2 because we had Priority Boarding- very nice if you want some extra space for legs. The tickets cost us about 85€ for 2 people return with priority and 2 pieces of luggage.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,10,2011-11-22,LDN Luton to CZK Praha. No problems at all. There were no long waits or hand luggage assessment and the plane and flight were both clean and smooth. Excellent service from cabin staff I would not hesitate to fly them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,7,2011-11-17,BUD-NPL. Flight on time cabin crew pleasant and jovial with passengers for the air fare paid great value and service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,7,2011-10-27,I fly every weekend LUT-BUD-LUT. Flights are pretty much on time now a few years ago they suffered a lot of problems. The crew are polite and helpful and the cabins clean but basic. All in all a very good no-frills service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,7,2011-10-24,Luton-Belgrade. It's like a game know the rules in advance. Check to see everything your going to be charged for before you pay. Always pay the £4 each way fee for extra leg room unless you are under 5 foot 4 tall it's so worth it. The hold baggage allowance is generous at 32kg but you pay for it but hand luggage is free and therefore closely watched so don't get greedy with either the size of the bag or weight (it's 10kg max). The planes are new cabin crew are polite but obviously trained to try and sell as much as they can during the flight. Ground staff were okay and overall had a pleasant trip. Only downside is Luton Airport I was embarrassed. I will pay the £3 in future to go through the priority security check I queued for 20 minutes last time not a school holiday and it was 7am! Disgraceful.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2011-10-17,Luton-Warsaw-Luton. Cabin crew friendly and efficient plane clean and new. Seat pitch is awful and very cramped. Fortunately the seats don't recline but tall/large people should consider paying for extra legroom seats. You need to stick to the rules - check in online print passes hand baggage only etc. if you want the best deal. But I liked Wizzair and would fly with them again. Good quality for the price and much better than Ryanair.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,3,2011-10-16,The booking process is very cumbersome and the hidden fees are a rip off. £5 for each leg of the journey plus a further fee for each person so a simple return journey attracts three booking fees. A scam. And then when you try to print the boarding passes the website is very clumsy and pointlessly pedantic and often doesn't work at all. If the website will not work but I arrive at the airport without a boarding pass I suppose there will be more trouble. This is not a low price airline just low quality. However I do applaud the non-reclining seats in this tight spacing. At least I do not have some selfish person reclining their seat in my face.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,5,2011-10-16,LTN-PRG. Despite other comments found getting through Luton very easy for this evening flight. No delays and boarded with free seating towards the end. Was asked by other passengers if I would swap several times. I was impressed by plane crew menu the price and punctuality. However the seat was the most cramped I have ever experienced and was impossible to sit comfortably in. . So despite the many positives I would not recommend wizz based on this trip.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,10,2011-09-28,Flights both ways were on time staff at check-in and Luton Airport and onboard were polite and friendly planes were clean and tidy and for a budget airline I was impressed.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,9,2011-09-26,Kiev Zhuliany to Simferopol. Check-in was fast however desk staff need some training of politeness. No trouble at boarding despite no allocated seat. Plane tidy and spotless. Crews were skilled and professional. Seat pitch was tight. Food and drinks were available at high prices so opted not to have breakfast onboard. Departed and arrived ahead of schedule. I appreciate their free 32 kg baggage allowance on domestic route. Seems to be the most generous in the industry for short haul flights. Overall good and consistent. And bring your own food or eat before flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2011-09-22,I travel frequently between London and Belgrade. They are obviously a budget airline but in my experience are the best of that bunch. I've had a few delays but no more than one would expect although they're admittedly quite bad at keeping passengers informed in such cases. I think the inflight staff are friendly with good language skills. I have on occasion heard stewardesses being a little short with drunk Englishmen on stag parties (watch out for the Friday flights!) but who can blame them for that.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2011-09-21,EIN-SOF-EIN trip for 66 Euros. Good value for money outbound departed and arrived on time inbound landed 30 minutes early. Seats are tight but aisle seats are okay. Flight crew ok and general atmosphere nice no pushy sales pitch for the inflight catering. Would recommend this airline for city trips.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,1,2011-09-20,NAP-BUD-NAP with a group of 12 people. Departure was on time gate staff rude and unprofessional at Budapest Ferihegy airport. They find any excuse to charge you for additional hand baggage. I was charged 60 Euros for a small piece of baggage I was obliged to pay cash as they were not ready to accept credit cards. 2 hours delayed departure on the second leg and uncomfortable old fashion non reclining seats. It is not really a low cost airline - poor quality for money.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2011-09-15,BVA-POZ-BVA and POZ-BOJ-POZ inbound 20 mins ahead of schedule each time outbound on time. I have nothing to complain lack of soap in the toilet in one of the legs but it can happen anywhere. Surprisingly no hassle with hand luggage smiling helpful crew. Captain informed of the flight details in English and Polish. Would fly again if the fare is low because you simply get what you paid for.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,7,2011-09-13,I have flown with them many times Luton-Warsaw and I have no complaints although checking in can be a nightmare at times. That aside you get what you pay for and for a 2 hr flight and for the price paid I had no problems.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,7,2011-09-11,Luton to Belgrade return. Both flights were on time and crews polite although a bit disinterested. Seating was comfortable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,,2011-09-10,Luton-Poznan return. Charged £68 for hold luggage on top of a not cheap ticket which never arrived until the evening before I returned. Contained my tools needed to work the next 2 days. Tiny legroom and crowded noisy plane. All in all a very bad experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,9,2011-09-03,Staff onboard are kind and pleasant carriers are clean and comfortable. Airport staff are rude and not professional at all. There are no Wizz Air staff responsible to take info or complaints. Being a low cost company does not compromise not having any customer support or assistance at all.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,,2011-08-30,My flight from Bourgas in Bulgaria was due to leave at 20.20 we were delayed over 4.5 hrs and had to divert to Sofia for the crew to be changed. In Sofia all 200 of us were turfed out and put on another plane which eventually left for Luton arriving at 03.21 local time some 5.5 hrs late. At Bourgas we were given a roll but no drink by the airline and this was meant to be representative of the length of our delay.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,2,2011-08-26,Luton-Budapest. Punctual flight and arrived early one of the older planes so seats a little tight but ok. Return Budapest-Luton 3 hr delay due to late arrival of inbound aircraft. Seat pitch on return was the tightest I've ever experienced horribly uncomfortable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,,2011-08-25,Delayed our flight from Venice to Budapest because the crew didn't turn up on time and we lost our connecting flight. We had to stay in Budapest for 2 days and ended up spending $700 for their negligence. They have hidden fees they do not tell you about until you input your credit card information. Flight attendants were rude unfriendly.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,2,2011-08-17,My bag was designed to be carry-on however it failed their fit test along with the bags of many other angry passengers. Rude unhelpful gate attendants. Leg room is the smallest I've seen.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,2,2011-08-12,Prague-Luton. The flight 1 week later than J Ezrati (USA) but with the same grievances. The carry-on allowance is pitiful. My bag was designed to be carry-on but failed their fit test together with the bags of many other seething passengers. Rude unhelpful gate attendants. The flight would almost certainly have been delayed due to their insistence on checking every bag had the flight been much more than two thirds full. Flight was fine but I (and several others from what I heard this morning) will not be flying Wizz again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,,2011-08-10,The airline has the smallest legroom I have ever seen I am 185cms tall and I had to stretch into the aisle. Luckily I was seated in D seat and E was free. I cannot imagine how taller people manage.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,2,2011-08-04,Prague to Luton. Flight was fine but it's amazing how many things they have found to charge people for. Cabin crew constantly trying to sell drinks food perfume simcards etc. The carryon limits are so small that it defies common sense. I saw a woman with a large purse that would easily fit in the overhead bin or the seat in front get rejected. The rude gate attendants and front desk staff seemed to find a way to get in an argument with everyone over their carryon luggage.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2011-07-30,Paris Bauvais to Timisoara. I didn't book for some luggage and when I confirmed my flight I couldn't add on their website some other things such as buying baggage only to call them at expensive number. I decided to squeeze things in my bag and not purchase any luggage for the flight. This time WizzAir at airport in Paris Beauvais put a special box before customs and each passenger has to fit its hand luggage in the box. The box is smaller than the one that can be found for Easyjet or Ryanair. The plane was clean crew doing its job. Not unpleasant and not fantastic neither.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,10,2011-07-13,Cork-Vilnius. Boarded last purchasing extra leg room is a good offer and really a must if you are tall or large (or both). Plane was full. Nice youthful crew clean vessel and no thrills service. Good value if you book ahead of time and travel light. Overall very pleased.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,7,2011-07-11,AAR-GDA and return in July. Nice clean and relatively new airplane. 2hrs late arriving in AAR but was only 1.5 hrs late when arriving in GDA. Reason was technical fault on the plane which we were informed about. Cheap flight and we got from A to B.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,5,2011-06-06,Main problem is their website. I often have problems trying to check-in. The first time also had problems with website changing title from Mrs to Mr which meant I had to call the premium rate line to get it fixed (which they did without fuss). So you need to budget for an hour or two of your time plus a five minute call to a premium rate number into the total cost. Then you may find its more cost effective to pay a higher price with another airline or just pay their airport check-in fee. In short a reasonable alternative to Ryanair but Easyjet is better at twice the price (if they serve your route).,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,7,2011-06-05,Luton-Warsaw-Luton. I printed my boarding passes (2 pages) from the online site and did not have any bags to check-in. The planes were bright. Cabin crew friendly. Leaving the plane at Warsaw delayed because it seemed impossible to find steps that would reach to the right height of the aircraft door. Same problem on return leg. On the outward flight seat pitch was comfortable but on the return seat pitch was very cramped and uncomfortable. Luckily the plane was not full and no-one sat in the middle seat of my row but this is not ideal for a long flight. I used their minibus service from Warsaw airport to the city. As we arrived late at night and with a delay I was pleased the bus had waited. Driver friendly but drove like a maniac down long straight roads with little traffic from the airport and through a few red lights. Overall good service but would hesitate to use Wizz again because of the seat-pitch being so small.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,5,2011-06-04,Wizz cancelled our flight just like that. Got the full refund after two attempts. They also charge for everything possible : baggage card payment.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,10,2011-06-04,We have flown Wizz Air many times as we have property in Romania and they are great. My mother is disabled and was lifted on the plane at Luton and helped at other end at Tirgu Mures Airport. The stewards were excellent for the money it was excellent. We love the new route to Tirgu Mures as it is a central location.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,,2011-05-30,Luton-Bucharest. My problem is with the Luton Wizz Air staff who were terrible. They were rude to everyone checking in that evening and then managed to lose our luggage and we realised why when we looked at our luggage receipts and they had put bags under completely different passenger names. Staff at Bucharest (not employed by Wizz) were polite and helpful but only managed to get our bags to us the evening before we flew back to Luton. Wizz air appears to have no customer services-only very expensive tel numbers with staff as useless as those at Luton.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,,2011-05-17,Luton to Budapest. Flight supposed to be 2025 got to gate to embark and they called a 2 hour delay as problem with plane. Estimated time for flight in the end was 11.00am the next day and I doubt whether that happened. Myself and a lot of others decided not to fly and it took over an hour to get our bags back off plane. Decided to book with easyjet. I lost 1nights accommodation 1 taxi transfer and too tired to do anything as by the time I arrived in Budapest just wanted to sleep so wasted day. Airport staff at Menzies were unhelpful (police were even called as a lot or irate people). Tiny prices but pathetic service will never fly Wizz Air again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2011-05-17,Luton to Budapest and back. Everything went to plan seats comfortable and thought it was very good value.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,,2011-05-10,Flight from Bergamo Italy on 6 May was cancelled. I learnt about this when I arrived on the airport 2 hours before the flight - no sms no call no warning from Wizz. Then they made me wait on a queue for 1:30hrs to tell me that I have to wait 3 days for the next flight or just buy a ticket for tomorrow from RyanAir which will not be reimbursed. WizzAir personnel didn't know nothing and just pointed the passengers to the ticket desk. They said the reason for cancellation was airport officials were having a strike but all the other airlines were flying and there wasn't a single cancellation besides Wizz. My guess is that because the passengers for my flight were around 30 people - they decided to just cancel it. Otherwise I don't see any reasonable explanation. Exercise strong caution!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2011-05-08,Luton-Prague. The ticket was much cheaper than competition on this route. Most problems with this trip related to Luton Airport and not the airline. Boarding slightly delayed due to a engineering inspection but kept well informed. Food and drinks offered onboard and crew appeared polite and efficient. Bags on the belt as I left passport control.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,,2011-05-02,On the outbound flight to Kiev - no card machine working so payment in cash only for any drinks etc on the flight. Inbound flight from Kiev they just happened to have the same problem but Wizz Air Ukraine cannot accept Ukrainian currency on their flights so we had to go without food or drink for the whole 3 hour flight. Add to that the fact that the bags are free on Wizz Air Ukraine so didn't pay for them or book them the bags online. No problem on the way out but on the way back refused to take the bags until I paid them 692 Hrvnia. Don't use them unless you don't eat drink or need to take luggage with you.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,5,2011-04-26,"I wouldn't advise to ever buy their Wizz Air Exclusive membership - it is cheating. I was silly enough to buy it and now cannot find any flight with this ""exclusive"" discount. The discounts simply disappeared from the flights where they used to be a couple of weeks ago when Wizz Air was actively promoting this service.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,2,2011-04-25,The flight from Eindhoven was late one hour. For flight from Vilnius they were very strict for luggage and service was rude. I would not recommend. Of course it is cheap but there are other cheap airlines so why bother.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2011-04-18,My two short hops (IEV-SIP-IEV) on time and trouble free. Remarkably good crews tidy planes good seats but pitch tight. I didn't buy their snacks and drinks (rip off prices!). I realize that if something goes wrong low-cost would be take it or leave it but in my case I've got a good value for money. Airport handling in Zhulyany was really low cost experience but all worked and didn't cause any problem. Fight for seats didn't look great but wasn't so bad.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,7,2011-04-14,I have been travelling with Wizz Air twice so far and I was very satisfied. The condition of planes is excellent and it is cheap if you book at the right time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2011-04-14,London Luton to Budapest. Seats confortable and soft although leg room is tight. Cabin crew was kind and dealt extremely well with medical emergency. Flight was slightly delayed but reached destination and my bags were on it so no complains.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,9,2011-04-10,Basically its a no frills airline and you get what you pay for. Booking early can give great prices. They have introduced fare discounts for holders of discount cards which cost £8.50. Plus side is new aircraft and generally good cabin crew. Downside is high prices for food and drink onboard. Airport shuttle transfers are good - usually 5-6 euro. Standard 32/10kg baggage is a plus for those needing it. I noticed the comments about legroom - they will usually tell that the seats in the middle by the exit doors have been reserved - I have seen this a few times so try and board last or wait till you hear the announcement boarding complete then simply move there. I have done this twice.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,7,2011-04-03,London Luton to Belgrade return. Nice relatively new aircraft; punctual on both flights I welcome the absence of reclining seats as these can inconvenience the person sitting behind. My only criticism is that is that it is not possible to book allocated seats. This results in a free for all at the aircraft.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,9,2011-03-31,"LTN-KBP. Wizzair's seats are very soft and wide but the legroom is extremely tight and it would be much more pleasant if the passenger in front could not recline their seat back further restricting your legroom. Other than that the cabin crew (all Polish) were smiling well groomed and acted with professionalism throughout the flight. The flight took off and landed on time with no issues at all. Wizzair have an ""Extra Legroom"" option available for a surcharge I think I will take advantage of this next time I am on a 3 hour flight with them. On a shorter sector I don't mind. For the price though they offer excellent value for money.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,1,2011-03-17,Flight from Bergamo-Cluj delayed 5.5 hours because of technical issues. Was given a McDonald food voucher for snack and drink but told in the departure area that it was only accepted on a different floor before passing the security check. Checked-in online but website was so slow the connection was timing out so I had to pay 10 euros for a piece of printed paper at the airport that was trashed when I was given another boarding pass. Seats are cramped and not reclining. Unless broke get a decent carrier. The price of tickets is cheap indeed but everything else is a rip-off.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,9,2011-03-09,Turku-Budapest return flight flight was on time drinks on the plane affordable seat is comfortable but you cannot recline crew nice with not perfect but good english bags not too late after landing.

Wizz Air customer review,1,2011-02-13,"I booked Katowice-Doncaster. The flight was delayed from 1940 to 0900 the following day. We were left in the departure lounge with no access to hot drinks or food during this time. A hotel was offered at 0200 but with no guarantees of when we would return to the airport and requiring us to reclaim bags etc. Information in English was almost totally impossible to find. The airline staff at the airport were mostly invisible and when present handled this totally unprofessionally. We were given a certificate by GTL Lot to prove the flight delay. I complained and received an email promising to deal with it. A month later nothing. A further email got a reply ""fill in our form"" - I had! The staff are obviously incompetent and poorly trained.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,9,2011-01-07,HHN-KTW-HHN. Very low fare (30 EUR return) payment a little complicated if you want to wire (cheaper than credit card). HHN-KTW slightly delayed airplane and seat pitch acceptable for a low cost carrier buy on board affordable). KTW-HHN operating while major carriers had flights cancelled due to snow.

Wizz Air customer review,,2010-12-24,My flight from London Luton to Zagreb had been cancelled twice : first time they had no fresh cabin crew and the second time because they did not have a plane for rebooked flights. There was no communication between airline and the airport staff until the very last moment of flight cancellations. If I have known after the first cancellation that the Wizz wasn't able to cope with cancellations backlog I'd not have rebooked my flight with them I'd used alternative routes. They have no consideration or care to their passengers and I have no wish to use them again or recommend them to anyone.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,,2010-12-22,Cramped late and surly but cheap. However God help you if you need extra luggage or need to discuss anything - offices never open phones lines are £0.75 per minute - and play music to you for the first 15 minutes. Overall not a money saver and makes you feel like cattle.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,,2010-12-18,We pre-booked a transfer through Wizz Air for when we flew Luton - Cluj. We waited an hour for our taxi and decided to phone to ask where it was only to be told that they had picked someone else up and no they weren't going to send anyone out to get us no they weren't going to refun the money and that in fact it was all our fault! We had to pay for another taxi to take us to our hotel which was half the cost we had already paid through Wizz Air. I tried to claim the money back from Wizz Air I have written 2 emails and 6 weeks later I am still awaiting a response. Think twice before using!!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2010-12-05,Luton - Prague - Luton. Snowy weather and two excellent journeys.

Wizz Air customer review,,2010-11-17,Luton-Prague-Luton. Poor service rude cabin crew refused to collect rubbish. Flight Deck Crew spent more time in passenger compartment chatting up cabin staff than flight duties. Ripped seats drunken football fans not dealt with at all. Priority boarding at Prague end ignored by ground staff. Toilets dirty.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,,2010-11-16,Budapest to London with A320 almost 7 hrs delayed. They said due to weather conditions but it wasn't true. We were told at the check-in desk that all Wizz planes were delayed that day so they had to wait for each other no staff etc. Anyway we got some vouchers to buy some food in Ferihegy. On the plane the legroom between the seats is very tight AC ran too cold. The crew was friendly and helpful.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2010-11-10,Weeze-Bucharest Baneasa return. Great value for money including baggage etc - return flight for less then €100. Check in at Weeze unorganized due to two lines for one check in desk which caused annoyance amongst passengers. Flight uneventful onboard catering boring. Bucharest Baneasa terrible airport but Wizz Air is not to blame for that.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,

Wizz Air customer review,6,2010-09-19,BBU-NRN. Bucharest Baneasa airport is easily reachable but not a nice location to be - very limited catering facilities and long queues at security. Had to check in online the day before and baggage dropping was a breeze. Bussed to plane with a slight delay free seating A320 not the newest but okay seating is very tight and cramped with no reclining seats. Luckily the seat next to me was free although the flight was about 95% full. Cabin crew announcements in Eenglish German and Romanian - English and German announcements virtually not understandable.

Wizz Air customer review,9,2010-09-06,Brussels-Budapest. Planes new with leather seats. Our flight delayed like many people commented here yet only for 30 min. Cabin crew were nice and helpful and their onboard menu is not expensive. Budapest airport T1 is one of the best low cost airports I have seen with free wifi and helpful staff. Good value for money better than Ryanair cheaper than EasyJet.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2010-09-01,Madrid to Katowice Kiev to Katowice Katowice to Madrid. Newish A320s on all segments. Clean aircraft comfortable seats polite and friendly service. As with other low-cost carriers with no assigned seating the gate areas get a bit push-and-shove with people elbowing to get ahead even though except for boarding in Madrid (which was a more-or-less orderly line through an airbridge) everyone's getting on a bus to be taken to the aircraft parked on the apron anyway. Noticeably better than Ryanair throughout the whole process and for me at least on these flights a notch above Easyjet.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,5,2010-08-26,Varna - London Luton. Modern clean aircraft with adequate legroom. My complaint was that the Captain switched on the seatbelt sign shortly after take off and said that the crew were unable to commence their inflight duties as we were expecting some turbulence. After an hour of near perfect flying conditions the seatbelt sign was switched off and the crew commenced the service. It seemed obvious that the crew could just not be bothered and sat in the rear galley chatting and eating.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,4,2010-08-02,BUD-CRL-BUD. A320's are okay especially the new additions to the fleet with a slightly different interior compared to the old ones. It is a usual no-frills airline so I do not have much to say about the FA's. The biggest problem with the airline is that its flights are almost always delayed (or at least on this route). It is usually operated towards mid - to late-afternoon which means delays have already accumulated during the day. I think you are lucky to get away with a 60-120 minute delay on my last CRL-BUD flight I was delayed for over 4 hours.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,6,2010-08-01,BGY-SOF and BBU-BGY. Flight to Sofia delayed half an hour with no remarks shown on the monitors; plane not brand new but acceptable seat pitch and polite crew. Return from Bucharest Baneasa was on time but the boarding hall in this airport is a disgrace being overcrowded with few monitors (very hard to be read) and with no space for more than 250 persons so guess what happens when all the 4 gates are operating at the same time. Besides that it took 40 minutes to get through passport control and security checks. The plane to Bergamo was a new A320 with miserable leg room and hard leather seats. As on the onward trip all the announcements were pronounced so quickly that it was almost impossible to understand what they were talking about. Even the safety announcements were obviously made only because it is compulsory by law since they were just rushing to complete the sentences as soon as possible complying with the short time between bording and departure. When I fly with a low cost carrier I often wonder if the cabin crew would really be able to manage any kind of emergency since I do have the feeling the everything is speeded up to the very limit and this is against safety. It was my first time with this airline and I do not find them to be worse or better than the other major cheap carriers I have been on so far.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,9,2010-07-26,Treviso to Lviv. Seemed like a new plane. Very comfortable satisfactory legroom and very polite and friendly service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,10,2010-07-24,Rome to Prague. Was very happy with the flight. Airplane clean with leather seats. The flight attendants were polite. Baggage claim was quick.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,,2010-07-15,This airline is terrible! Timetable changes (moving flights to different days rather than times) after you've booked are unacceptable when people have already made non-refundable bookings for ground transportation and hotels etc). Wizzair do this with appalling regularity and with no regards for the effect on its customers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,8,2010-06-23,We often fly with Wizzair to/from Charleroi/Budapest and find it quite reliable at least on these destinations. The cabin crew is usually friendly and assists with our small children. We only got a lost suitcase once around Christmas so it took longer to retrieve it but we eventually did. I don't know about other destinations but if you intend to fly between Brussels (Charleroi) and Budapest I would recommend it.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,,2010-06-19,Avoid Wizzair! A group of us had our outgoing flight cancelled. We made a claim for a refund for that flight. That was 6 weeks ago and there has been no response. I have called their phoneline (which is premium rate @ 95cent per minute) several times and no one has ever answered. Those calls have cost me around 40 euros already. Terrible company,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Wizz Air customer review,5,2010-06-16,PRG-LTN and LTN-PRG were rather good flights. Minimum legroom friendly staff. Would prefer flying CSA to Heathrow any day but we flew to LTN on Friday and back on the following Tuesday bought tickets on Tuesday afternoon for 8900 Czech crowns all included (1 checkin bag) - that's less than 250GBP when buying 2 days in advance - cheaper than any other carrier.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Wizz Air customer review,1,2010-06-06,London - Kiev. First problem started a few weeks prior to travel when the return flight was simply cancelled. No explanation offered. We had to buy (very expensive by then) BA tickets instead. Refund from Wizzair was promised but never given. Contact over an email is not possible. I called their premium phone line numbers at least 4 times to chase my refund - still no refund. Flight - delayed by 1.5 hours on the way out - people queuing up at the gate - no explanation offered. No drinks available on the flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
