"""Okay was our general impression""",5,2019-12-08,"Hargeisa to Djibouti. Air Djibouti operates one single Boeing 737-500, leased with crew from a company in Tajikistan, as well as, reportedly, a few smaller aircraft. We flew from Hargeisa to Djibouti in November. The plane had arrived from Mogadishu with a delay but landed in JIB almost on time. It was definitely at least 25 years old but appeared to be in a very good state of repair. Seats were tight but comfortable. Catering consisted of a single bottle of water, which was ok on this 40-min hop. Okay was also our general impression.",True,B737,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Hargeisa to Djibouti,November 2019,4,3,,4,3,,True
