"""no transfer came""",1,2019-10-14,"Me and my family (which included an 11 and a 16 year old) were due to be picked up from our hotel, the San Antonio Hotel and Spa in Bugibba, Malta, at between 7.45 – 8.15am, for a transfer to Malta airport and then our return flight home at 11am. We waited in the hotel reception between those times and no transfer came! At 8.17, I rang your Jet2 customer service helpline and was told that the transfer was often late and should ring again if it hadn’t arrived by 8.30. I rang again at 8.35 and was told that the representative I spoke to would look into the issue and call me back. As I hadn’t received a call back by 8.55, and our flight was due to take off in just over 2 hours time, I rang Jet2 again! Once again, I was told one of their reps would look into where the transport to the airport was as a matter of urgency and call me straight back! Finally, I got a call back saying that there had been some sort of clerical error on your part and we would have to make our own way to the airport! I was told to book a taxi and that I would be reimbursed for this expense once we arrived at the airport. I informed the representative that I didn’t have enough money for a taxi as we had spent all our remaining euros, it being our last night on holiday. The Jet2 rep was not very understanding, and when I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was put on hold for two minutes then cut off! During the next 20 minutes, both me and my wife tried getting back in touch with Jet2 but were either kept on hold or cut off again, twice! I finally managed to get through but the customer services representative we spoke to was very rude and patronising to my wife, suggesting that I run around the resort and find a cash point to withdraw money for a taxi! When my wife asked to speak to a manager to complain about her attitude, she was cut off. By now, I had managed to withdraw some cash and the hotel had booked me a taxi. We got to Malta airport, after great stress and upset, worrying about what would happen if we missed our flight, at 10.10am (50 minutes before the scheduled take off!). The stress and anxiety we endured when trying to get to the airport put a massive dampener on what had been a nice holiday! On return to the UK, I contacted Jet2 to tell them of the poor service we had received from their customer services team, and after several email exchanges, during which Jet 2 admitted fault for the whole incident as their transfer operator had forgotten to pick us up, I was offered a derisory amount of compensation (approximately 0.015% of what we had paid for a holiday that had cost us over £6,200 with Jet2) , I escalated the issue to their CEO, Stephen Heapy. The response from his Customer Services Escalation Executive was to agree that while the level of service we had received was below their required standards and the admission that they were at fault, they would not be taking this matter any further! I feel obliged to share my experience as I would hate for anybody else to go through the stress and trauma we endured for those few hours, without and help or support from Jet !

",6,2019-05-28,"Leeds Bradford to Thessaloniki. For the most part, this airline is fine. Both the outbound and return flights took off an hour late, not the longest of delays but a bit annoying. The pilots made up a chunk of time on the return and we arrived only 25 mins after the scheduled time. I guess the swift turnaround helped to explain the lack of cleaning. Always a bit disconcerting to open one's tray table to find the spill marks of a previous passenger’s drink (see pic). Same plane for both journeys, a 27 year-old 737-300. However, it had been retrofitted, including winglets, and the interior looked very new. Apart from it being a little noisy, the plane’s age was no issue. The seats were interesting, plastic with minimal cushioning (see pic). They didn't lean back (a good thing) and had tiny armrests (a bad thing). I suppose it allows the airline to fit more in without reducing legroom. They were comfy enough for the first couple of hours, but as we approached the third hour, the lack of cushioning started to tell + the plastic felt sticky (avoid wearing shorts). The legroom was perfectly fine for short haul. This is the first flight I’ve taken on which there were no window blinds or dimmers. A real curiosity, and I can’t think why they would be absent. It made the outbound journey uncomfortable until I fashioned a blind of my own using a sweatshirt. Until then, the sun was pretty blinding and hot. As a budget product, Jet2 is perfectly decent. Booking easy; online check-in and printing of boarding passes easy; no IFE but none was expected; didn't bother ordering food but the menu items were predictably overpriced; didn't pay for checked-in baggage as the 10kg allowance for hand luggage was enough for my short trip (well done for this in particular Jet2!). The staff were fine. Efficient and friendly enough without being overbearing. I felt a bit sorry for them to be honest, having to spend much of their time trying to sell stuff. I guess it's the necessary economy of the budget airline. I didn't like the fact that they prohibited the drinking of one's own alcoholic beverages, and only allowed us to consume those bought on board. I appreciate there’s a security aspect (being able to refuse extra drinks to very drunk people) but I suspect there’s a profit-based motivation too. Naturally, when the crew announced “you shouldn’t drink your own alcoholic drinks”, I understood it as “you shouldn’t get caught drinking your own alcoholic drinks”.

** EDITED - HAVE THEY SENT TICKET ??",2,2018-05-09,"So have used Jet2, recommended them to family and friends, had good experiences and seeing as I live next to Stansted airport and they have replaced the easyJet service that moved to Southend a number of years ago, it's been a win-win for me, until the last flight on Sunday. Informed two days into our holiday at our family holiday home, that we had a ""change in equipment"", unable to reply to this, I had guessed we were flying on a 757 as that's the other aircraft type Jet2 fly, instead of the 737-800 that usually flies the route. Then I saw our seat row numbers, I had paid for allocated seats, together, in row 2 as I was travelling with my partner and her 83 year old mother as I wanted to be up the front of the aircraft and near an exit. My new boarding pass was for row 29, not at all what I wanted. At check in (we were dropping a hold bag), I explained my unhappiness to helpful groundstaff, they pointed me over to the Jet2 help desk, who logged my concerns, I wanted at best a refund, to be told that they only guaranteed we would sit together, I suggested why would we choose our seats and pay extra, if we wouldn't get the ones we wanted. They again trotted out the same excuse: it only guaranteed you sit together. I explained that I have travelled on my own, paid extra to choose my seat last year, on my own, if they could bump me to another row, what was the point of paying extra, to which the lady in question agreed that I had a point. Then I explained: as our seats were on the original aircraft, surely, those passengers on the original aircraft should surely be given the same seats on this replacement aircraft, that Jet2 changed and added passengers not on the original scheduled aircraft, that they should get the seats at the back as it was a bigger aircraft, again, the lady agreed with me. Not happy. Once through the new layout at Faro airport, security, realised that there were a great many more passengers, which I explained to my partners mother, we'll be through quickly as they will have extra staff to cope (my partners mother has to take medication for a medical condition and her next dose was in an hour). I must explain, that we were at the airport 3 hours before our departure time, so plenty of time we thought. Then to immigration, or so we thought. The new layout at Faro, segregates: UK, Irish and Canadian passports to the left, all others to the right, there is an analogy there, it felt like it: a queue, we joined at 7, no air, crammed like cattle, it took over an hour to get to the bottom of the escalator, to see to our dismay that we weren't even halfway to the one passport desk open. By my estimate, given the number of people in front, behind, the flight information screens, I would estimate over a thousand poor souls were expecting to get through one passport desk, surely Jet2 would have told Faro airport of our bigger aircraft and more passengers. A lady passed out, one was sick, there were threats to people trying to jump the queue. After an hour, medication for my partners mother, we could wait no more: we called a member of staff who fast tracked us. Consequence: we saved an hour in the queue, one of the first on the new aircraft, Titan Airways. Thankfully we got overhead storage space, others did not.

I got a price quote of almost 3 times what I paid with Jet2 for a similar flight with another airline.  The main problem I had with this flight was with my fellow passengers, some of who felt the need to stand chatting in the aisle for almost the whole flight so other passengers wishing to use the toilets had to squeeze past causing them to bump into seated passengers and making it difficult for cabin crew to serve meals and drinks.

"""not a word from the pilot""",4,2015-08-31,"We have been travelling with Jet2.com for years, usually as a family group of 7 or 8 adults, and were on this flight last night from Malaga to Edinburgh. Just the usual, arrive at the gate, never expect to board on time these days, too many variables and we accept this. Didn't really notice the time we boarded, just that we were late. On the plane, usual head count and crew checking seat belts all on. Not a word from the pilot, which in my experience is very unusual. Normally welcome aboard etc, and a little about the route we will be taking approximate time of arrival and time at destination. Pilot then advised crew we are refuelling, no word to passengers. I have been on planes a few times and the rule has always been passengers do not fasten seat belts when refuelling. I checked up on the information on this, and these are not recommendations this is what is supposed to happen. We finally took off around 40 minutes after we got on the plane. Still not a word acknowledgement or apology from the pilot or crew about the late departure, it was not acknowledged at any time. To add insult to injury, the crew, who did their usual efficient job had the brass neck to hand out vouchers to us all not long before landing, £60 off holidays or flights one to each person. These vouchers can only be used one per booking, and we were given them on 29th August. They expired on 31st August. After a flight like this one not sure about booking Jet2 any time soon. We finally heard from the pilot who announced that we were landing in Edinburgh. We finally landed in some part of the airport and taxied for about 15 minutes to another far flung area, then we had a 15 minute bus ride to get to the terminal. That must be cheaper for Jet2 than an airbridge, not sure what happened to passengers with wheelchairs, needing assistance etc. Usually travel with dad who does, and was glad he wasn't there, at 85 he would have found the whole experience difficult. The pilot did make up time on the flight, ground crew I spoke to said he was on the stand at 10.30 pm. Our arrival should have been 10pm. 10.45 pm we were in the terminal building.

The online booking was quick and easy, however. when it came time to do the online check-in, the Jet2 website presents itself so that you assume you have to book your seats (at an extra cost) - I checked-in the day my email arrived to confirm that check-in had opened. Our party of 3 (1 child) ended up not sitting together on either journey, but I still reserved seats and paid extra. The check-in at East Midlands was good and the attendants were helpful and friendly. However, the flight was very impersonal - recorded messages and staff were aloof to the point of rudeness. If you are sat near the middle of the plane ensure you take a drink and something to eat with you, as you will be served last and the food runs out! Legroom OK but seats are very uncomfortable - our 4 hour flight however turned into 5.5 hours as we were sat on the runway for an hour because we ""missed our slot"". The flight back was horrendous - we were delayed 2 hours (30 mins in the airport and 1.5hours sat on the plane) and were told that ""due to technical issues some of the baggage had to be unloaded from the plane and would follow on in a couple of days""! We received no explanation other than ""technical issues"" and at East Midlands there were probably a dozen cases - everyone elses baggage had been offloaded! Then were we all queueing again for forms to be given to us so we could have our baggage couriered to us when they eventually have it flown back - which could be up to a week, if it doesn't go missing in the meantime.

Jet2.com customer review,2,2015-04-04,LS196 on 29th March. Reviewing on behalf of my son and parents who flew from Prague to Manchester after joining us for a weekend there. They comment that the plane look old and very worn out inside the air system was very loud and the toilet door would not shut having to be repeatedly slammed throughout the flight. The plane was in fact no spring chicken at 28 years old. My parents were last aboard as there were large groups of young fit men aboard and in their 70s they can't move like they used to. This shouldn't have been an issue as they were booked on the front row. Unfortunately Jet2 seem to be of the opinion that people on the front row don't need an overhead locker. Whilst they only had two very small bags (not roll on cases) they asked the stewardess to help them find some space. At which pointed she shouted at my tiny assuming mother in law that she should have got on the plane earlier. Frankly my mother in law was astonished by this rhetoric. Someone is always going to be last on the plane does that mean they don't have a right to stow their luggage. Of course their luggage ended up miles away so getting off was difficult. As usual Jet2 ran out of sandwiches and of course as usual their flights were booked at convenient times at a premium compared to other airlines and changed to an inconvenient one with no refund.

Throughout the flight they spoke on the internal phone and every time they replaced it they slammed it with great force making a huge bang which after numerous occasions was very wearing. I felt the noisy announcements and attempts to sell were misplaced on an evening flight. Other than that the flight was okay but as usual Jet2 sold out of sandwiches and toasties. Plus we only had euros to hand and the exchange rate was daylight robbery. Two hot drinks and one Twix converted at 9 euros. Ouch. Unfortunately our English money was in the hand luggage which was of course nowhere near our seats. A man a couple of rows back from us was allowed to board the plane with four separate pieces of hand luggage filling an entire overhead bin. Why Jet2 cannot be stricter about hand luggage sizes and number of pieces I cannot understand. Towards the end of boarding all hand luggage had to be checked as so little space was left. Frankly it was all a bit shambolic and like the attitude of the cabin crew did not instil any confidence.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,2,,False,
Jet2.com customer review,2,2015-04-01,Flew from Manchester to Prague. Several large groups of stag parties most well behaved but one group noisy and smelling strongly of alcohol. Despite them sitting in the wrong seats and having to be asked to move and being rude when asked to move off the extra legroom front row they were not unboarded after some time sat on the tarmac it was announced that one of the engines would not start. Despite engineers coming out the situation could not be rectified. During this time everyone was asked to remain seated. Of course the large stag do did not and one couple insisted on standing practically in the galley for most of this time causing an obstruction and repeatedly standing on the person at the end of our row as they had to repeatedly shift out of the way of the toilet door though this behaviour wasn't the fault of the staff not controlling it was making an unpleasant two hour delay on the plane even worse. Eventually we were off loaded straight onto another plane. As it was a different plane we were told it would be open seating. The six people in the extra legroom then had to marshalled past the crowd of people in the galley who had refused to sit down. We were bussed to the other plane so of course despite being offloaded first we could not get off the bus first and when we went up the steps all the extra legroom seats had been taken by people who hadn't paid for them. Eventually the people who had were seated halfway up the plane in weirdly configured double seats with no window access. To be blunt this was only a minimal concern as I was too busy being horrified at how old and tatty the plane was that we had been moved to. It looked old and dirty and poorly maintained in the interior at least. After take-off the rest of the flight was uneventful except that of course Jet2 ran out of sandwiches after serving a couple of rows. No refreshment etc. was offered during the delay and the plane was for some reason absolutely freezing. Overall a poor effort for flights that weren't that cheap.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,1,,False,
Jet2.com customer review,10,2015-04-01,I have flown to Palma from Edinburgh on a couple of occasions with Jet2. I think their service is brilliant. Planes are fine with good legroom excellent baggage allowance and great flight slots. I would use them every time where they operate to where I am going. With regards to sitting together if in large parties its quite simple book in advance or take your chance - its not their fault if you fall foul. If you get a public bus can you guarantee sitting in your own company - no I think not.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,

Jet2.com customer review,8,2015-03-20,Flight from East Midlands to Madeira and return March 2015. We had good flight times both ways on time and seats comfortable enough for the 3.5 hr flight. The only downside was the exchange rate for the Euro onboard the plane. Having purchased 2 coffees on the return journey and paying in Euros I paid around £4 per cup for the advertised £ 2.50 drinks. Had I been told it was cheaper to pay in £ rather than Euros I would have done this.

Flew with them in August from Newcastle to Lanzarote and stayed there on a package holiday with them for 11 nights. Through the flight they told us all the deals they had on and they gave us plenty of chances to purchase something. We had good flight times as we left Newcastle at 15.20 on time and arrives in Lanzarote at 19.30 which was 30 minutes early. I travelled with 5 other people and we all had 22kg baggage allowance 10kg hand baggage each and we all had transfers.

The flight was fine the cabin crew were efficient and although the selling is mildly irritating an IPod and earphones take care of it. We were late taking off due to some passengers arriving late at the gate but this was due to issues at the airport and were not Jet2's fault. Leg room was reasonable and the plane was clean.

Jet2.com customer review,,2015-01-14,Flight from Arrecife to Glasgow airport on January 6th 2014. Several weeks prior to flight the times were changed meaning a later arrival at Glasgow on the return flight. At Arrecife the plane began to taxi to the runway then stopped. The captain announced a small technical fault. The plane was directed back to the stand and engineers called. As it could not be fixed it was finally decided to return to Glasgow flying low in the hope the fuel would last the journey otherwise we would have to land and refuel at Manchester. The arrival at Glasgow was just under 3 hours late meaning we did not get home until almost 2am. On the flight from Arrecife we were sitting in the plane for over 2.5 hours before take off and only the children were given water. The adults had to pay for drinks including water. They also ran out of food. I would now rather fly from Scotland to Gatwick and then onward with a different airline as Jet2 seem plagued by technical faults and have spoiled the end of three holidays for us. They are not a cheap airline and they are uninterested in the welfare of their passengers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,2,,False,
Jet2.com customer review,,2015-01-14,Edinburgh to Chambery on Dec 27th. The weather was poor so Jet2 unloaded ski bags before departure to enable them to carry extra fuel. They didn't just unload skis though they also left behind a bag with all our children's clothes. They didn't tell passengers if their bags had been unloaded but left everyone to wait until all bags had been collected to work out that theirs was missing. We were diverted to Lyon and had to wait 3 hours before we were allowed off the plane. In that time jet2 offered us a single complimentary drink but insisted we pay for all snacks. Once in Lyon we were bussed to Chambery arriving many hours after the original scheduled time meaning all transfers had been missed and we would have to sleep in the airport overnight. Jet2 then refused to offer any assistance claiming their responsibility to us was over. Not easy with 2 young children. We contacted jet2 about the delayed bag and they refused to have it sent on to our resort saying it was up to us to make arrangements to collect the bag ourselves and at our own expense. There's no car hire in the resort and no suitable public transport so no way to collect the bag ourselves. Even if there was it's a 6 hour round trip. After 4 days the airport staff not jet2 delivered the bag. The flight out had no onboard catering and although we had booked and prepaid meals we have been told we need to write a letter to claim a refund instead of them processing it automatically. On the return flight the meals were burnt and they didn't have any replacements. In all the worst uncaring customer service ever.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,,1,,False,

On landing at the baggage hall we found one of our premium quality cases had one of the wheels ripped off. Did all the claims procedure and got nowhere after six months of emails etc. gave up.

Jet2.com customer review,10,2014-11-12,We have just used Jet2 for a holiday for the first time and it wont be the last I can't believe how efficient they were. Due to the extra security we have experienced at Manchester Airport in the past we arrived 3 hours before our flight time to ensure we had plenty of time. We got out of our taxi 5am and by 5:30 we were sat having a coffee. On checking in we were given our gate number and advised it was quite a walk to the gate which was a help as the information wasn't up on the departure screens.

Jet2.com customer review,2,2014-10-31,We were told at the airport when checking in that if we wanted to have seats together we needed to pay extra for this. If we paid there were plenty of seats together if we wanted them. I don't know if they charge extra for people wanting to stay together in the same room when people book a holiday! On the return flight they just has one desk open for most of the time to check in at. At the airport over 2.5 hours before the flight we spent most of the time standing waiting to get checked in. We then had to wait 30 minutes on the plane while the rest of the passengers tried to get through security. With no time even to buy water etc at the airport they made plenty of money from their trolley service.

Jet2.com customer review,10,2014-10-28,Our flights from and to Blackpool were changed to Manchester due to the closure of Blackpool Airport. Jet2 kept us up to date with what was happening. It meant that our flights to and from Malaga were changed to a later time and I phoned to ask if we could change them. We could but would have had to pay extra so we decided to stick with the changes. Jet2 arranged transport by coach to Manchester and back to Blackpool Airport (RIP). The cost of this was absorbed by Jet2 even though the changes were no fault of theirs. The staff at both ends were excellent and the Blackpool staff even made us a cup of coffee whilst we waited for the coach. I believe staff at Blackpool have received verbal abuse from passengers angry at the closure of the airport. The Jet2 employees have their jobs at risk unlike their passengers who have had to have their holidays disrupted a little and do not deserve any criticism.

I am really sad about the closure of Blackpool airport which was so convenient for me. Jet2 are usually punctual and reliable and generally I like the airline. The thing that irritates me is the loud horrible pop music they always play when boarding the plane - some quiet music from the country we are flying to would be much more appropriate.

We brought our own snacks on board but there didn't seem to be a shortage of food and drinks. The ground and cabin staff were all very friendly.

We chose to pre book meals which were hot and tasty and served very promptly indeed - within 40 minutes of take off.

Jet2.com customer review,,2014-09-24,The flight left almost 4 hours late as Jet2 hadn't put enough fuel in to take into account circling while windy weather was negotiated. The level of information given was not satisfactory customers queued for 3/4 hour believing the flight was waiting for them before being told that it was not coming on time. We were then told that the gate had changed to gate 2 at which time everyone stood up and again formed a queue for 1/2 hour before again giving up and finding a seat. Some of the customers were elderly and should not have had to stand around and be herded about in this way. This treatment seemed extremely disrespectful. In the meantime other flights managed to set off without too much delay. We were given only a cup of tea on the flight when it eventually left and no other refreshments in all of that time. We were very hungry on the flight but the attendants did not get to us until near the end of the flight. When I initially complained I received an email apologising.

Again we were asked if we would like to check in any hand luggage/case into the hold free of charge. A fire alarm went off at this airport whilst we were queuing to have our boarding passes checked. We were evacuated out of the airport and then returned to be checked again to board efficiently. Some people were very rude and uncomplimentary to staff which we found unfair as the ""fire"" (false alarm) was nothing to do with the airline.

At Budapest the same again we waited in a queue in a shed-like building without any toilet facilities until you got on the plane for about 1 hour while they let previous passengers out etc. Flights were slightly delayed both ways and on the way our we were actually on a Neos plane instead of Jet2 and the inflight magazine was only in Italian.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,2,,False,

Jet2.com customer review,,2014-09-06,Travelled from Palma Mallorca to Manchester on 29/08/2014. Absolutely appalling customer service throughout. During our holiday my 17 year old daughter was involved in an accident and seriously injured her foot. We had to arrange our own alternative transfer arrangements as my daughter was too disabled to get on the pre-booked coach transfer. Jet2 were not interested. We were provided with a letter from the surgeon who strongly recommended that my daughter travel with her injured foot elevated but Jet2 informed us that all extra legroom seats were already pre-booked and were only available to able bodied passengers anyway because of their location on the plane. On arrival at Palma airport the wheelchair was not waiting for us as they promised it would be! Jet2 staff at the airport said they knew nothing about it so we had to arrange for a wheelchair ourselves. Spanish airport staff were fine but the problems recommenced as soon as we were handed back over to Jet2. We were told that because of my daughter's disability she along with 3 other passengers would be first to board the plane. We were called to the plane but when we reached the aircraft we were unable to board as the cleaners were still working on board. We had to wait ten minutes while they finished by which time the rest of the passengers had been sent down the tunnel to board. The first air stewardess was extremely surly and unhelpful. We were not helped or directed to our seats and after much struggling to get my daughter sat down were informed by another equally unhelpful stewardess that we were in the wrong seats. Meanwhile the rest of the passengers were boarding and it was extremely stressful for my daughter. Throughout the journey the stewardesses were extremely offhand and unprofessional. After an extremely difficult flight my daughter was helped from the plane by very pleasant (non Jet2) Manchester Airport staff while the stewardesses remained unprofessional surly and quite sarcastic.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,1,,False,
Jet2.com customer review,,2014-09-06,Flew to Palma from Edinburgh on the 22nd August 2014. The resort was Puerto Pollensa a 45 minute taxi ride from Palma airport. Our flight took 3 hours we were on the bus for 3.5 hours! Jet2 have really got to do something about their transfer system. We boarded the bus and were told by the rep that we were only waiting for 5 people. What she did not tell us was that there 5 families to come and off different flights! In addition the air con on the bus was not working and people including a young baby were getting distressed and overheated. When we eventually got on our way the driver took us to the middle of nowhere where we had to move ourselves and our luggage to another bus. No explanation or apology was offered as the driver could not speak English. Beware using Jet2 to fly to Palma unless they sort out this debacle which ruined the start of many people's holidays.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,1,,False,
Jet2.com customer review,2,2014-09-06,"We arrived at the airport on time used the airport lounge etc. but we were a little disappointed when we booked in as jet2 had given us separate seats and there was an extra charge for us to sit together! Even though there were seats available they purposely done this to get more money out of you. Now at this moment in time at East Midlands Airport we have been told that there is a 1.5 hour delay the only plane throughout all the flights with a delay today!

Jet2.com customer review,9,2014-09-01,17-27th August 2014 Flight LS169/LS170. Flew with Jet2 for the fist time with family and friends. Very happy with service throughout and would certainly use again. I had a few queries before I left that were always promptly replied to via email and one of the passengers had given me her married name and only realised it was her maiden name on her passport the day before we were due to fly. I rang Jet2 and they sorted it out right away at no cost which was brilliant. We only took hand luggage but they let us put it in the hold anyway. The only reason I didn't give absolutely top marks was that even though I booked quite a few flights all together we weren't all sat together on the plane.

Jet2.com customer review,9,2014-09-01,Leeds to Dusseldorf on 3rd July 6pm convenient departure time. I was not looking forward to the automatically allocated middle seat however the flight was not full and had the row to myself. The ticket cost was unbeatably low. There was a very rowdy group of passengers on the flight and the crew did put in a great effort to keep the situation under control. The catering is reasonably prices and of a good quality. The aircraft was an older version a Boeing 737-300 which was just fine for this 1 hour route but I'm unsure if I'd be willing to fly longer routes onboard due to a fairly small seat pitch. However overall the flight was hassle free and very good. I am planning to fly the same route with Jet2 again soon.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,

Myself and fellow traveller with chosen seats in row 1 pleasant enough flight but on arrival at Edinburgh the ground staff member advised the chief steward that he had not closed the door properly on departure. Not at all reassuring and even if this being the case might have mentioned this more discretely and certainly not in front of passengers. Bad enough that the average age of the fleet is 25 years old to treat the safety of all on board with such disregard is just inexcusable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,,,3,,True,

Jet2.com customer review,,2014-08-18,On a return flight from Malaga to Edinburgh we checked in on time. Flight delayed. After a few hours we boarded plane in 39 deg heat and suffered for over an hour whilst the computer was supposedly getting fixed. Pilot told us we would have to return to terminal as the plane had to shut down and the computer would have to re-boot. Stuck in terminal and eventually told that the plane was going nowhere. After 5 hours we received vouchers for a meal. 5 Euros and the cheapest sandwich was more. 6 hrs delayed and no information from Jet 2 staff. After 7 hours delay we were then told that the plane was almost repaired and ready to go. The captain arrived later to inform us that a sensor in the landing gear was faulty and had to be replaced. Would not answer any questions because he was needed in the plane to ensure us a speedy flight home. Flight was to leave 1400 hrs and we departed at approx. 2200 hrs local time. 8hrs delay approx.

No ice in 32 degree heat after having to wait for 90 minutes to even get a drink? Unacceptable. Will definitely not use again! PS: Don't bother with contacting their customer service either.

We did manage to get on the flight on the way back again they couldn't find us in the system luckily I had all the booking confirmations. They manage to finally find us and we were told that the plane wouldn't be a jet2 plane it was a different airline in which the cleanliness of the plane was awful. As soon as we walked onto the plane the small of urine hit you. The second time I booked with them I had to change the date of the outbound flight I expected to pay an admin fee but they also charged me more. I questioned this and she said it was because the flights were more expensive today then when I purchased them I was on their website whilst on the phone and I told the lady that the flights for that day are actually cheaper then what I paid. She said that's a different system I couldn't believe it as I said before I had no problem with the admin fee but being changed more for flights that were cheaper on that day then when I purchased them.

We had chosen seats 4a&B flying out where I got a generous amount of legroom. I'm 6ft 3 so I never thought it would happen on a LCC. Had the breakfast bought for us by my workmates and despite being fairly small was very tasty. Seat was comfortable and plane looked brand new even though it was at least 20 years old. Landed 20 mins early as a bonus. Flight back was an hour late due to fog at LBA captain was all apologetic and kept us up to date where he could. Same plane flying back (G-CELS) but sitting in 20 E&F. Workmates surprised us again with a bottle of champagne which was demolished within 15/20 mins. Slightly bumpy landing but given that no-one in the plane could see the runway due to all the fog its forgivable. No problems at all would definitely recommend and fly with them again.

Jet2.com customer review,8,2014-07-22,Flew to Dalaman from Glasgow with Jet2 and I have to say the flights were fantastic. The cabin crew were great and the service was excellent. The seats were very comfortable and it is worth paying the extra for the leg room. There wasn't much inflight entertainment but in this day and age it's not really important.

Jet2.com customer review,4,2014-07-20,I was on a return flight from Heraklion (Crete) to East Mids (UK) and I have to say it wasn't great. Sure the seats were comfortable enough and the crew pleasant but then a few niggling problems began to arise. Firstly the panel near my feet had worked loose so I had to wedge it up with my book for the flight to prevent it falling off altogether not such a flying start if you'll pardon the pun. Secondly after waiting 2.5 hours on a 4 hour flight the food trolley came about. As it turned out only half the food was actually available and even that over priced. There was only one of three toasties available Cheese and Tomato. When this £3.80 sandwich arrived it was lovely and blackened and tasted akin to something spread over fields to help the crops grow. Furthermore I also ordered a Pepsi as I was particularly thirsty. I was horrified to discover a 330ml can cost £1.60! A mark up of 300% compared to my local supermarket. Thankfully the rest of the flight was bearable however a lack of a compartment to store books phones etc on the back of the seat in front was an annoyance also and the poor sound proofing meant a conversation with you neighbour required raised voices. I would conclude by saying that the food and drink was expensive and of poor quality there was a lack of simple amenities such as a place to put your items that you did not want to keep lugging your hand luggage down for. Cleanliness was also lacking as sweets and wrappers were present on the floor when I got on the plane. I will not fly Jet2 again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,3,,False,

I did eventually manage to persuade someone in management to waive the £17.50 airport check-in charge but not until I had stood my ground for some time on the phone. The whole experience with Jet2 is of a low headline fare followed by constant attempts to ramp up the actual cost you pay and complete inflexibility should you fall foul of the Ts & Cs through however small or innocent a mistake.

Clean plane and friendly staff but then the surreal part was they gave us a menu and a vocal on the food available which was extensive.

I know they are a budget airline but even so the experience was particularly dismal. They don't pay for a stand at the terminal in either airport so passengers are crammed into buses to be ferried to and from the plane. The planes we had were shabby and the seats uncomfortable.

But now they have direct flights to Venice from our local airport Newcastle it was a no-brainer. So have they improved? Well our 737-300 was nearly 28 years old but looked fresh and clean with a refurbished interior which had the new seats with fixed thin backs profiled to give decent legroom. The cushions were a bit short but overall were fine for a flight of less than 3 hours. There was plenty of information from the flight deck and the cabin crew were excellent being friendly and efficient although we could have done without the loud and strident sales pitch on the PA but I suppose it's par for the course. Both out and return flights were smooth and on time. Now if only Jet2 would impose their own cabin baggage policy to stop passengers cramming huge bags into the overhead lockers things might be perfect for a budget airline.

And that is expensive of course) and very good hand baggage allowance (10 kilos each person). Pre - booked seats as well - these and hold baggage were extra of course but then what 'low cost' airline gives them away for free. Aircraft was a 737-800 - in such good condition it must have been virtually new and a surprisingly generous leg room allowance.

We offered to pay for the disabled seats but were told this could not be done and that on the day of departure these seats could be sold as extra legroom to all and sundry. They girl on the phone was quite rude and unhelpful. We have travelled with many airlines most of who will bend over backwards to help disabled passengers. Jet2 should be made to stop discriminating against disabled people.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,

Jet2.com customer review,5,2014-05-17,Flew with Jet2.com on 8th May returning 15th to Palma. We were going to Cala Millor so the onward journey from Palma took just over two hours one hour being spent sitting on a coach waiting for other passengers which is not the airlines fault but is still nevertheless very frustrating. On return journey we were picked up at our hotel at 6.55a.m.picked up people from other resorts and were at the check in desk at 8.25am. a full three hours before our flight to Belfast. We had been in the airport for about an hour and a half checking the departure board for our gate number when other passengers informed us that delays were probable because of the French Air Traffic Controllers strike.We knew nothing of this and felt it should have been pointed out to us at the check-in desk. Have flown with Jet2 before but felt rather disappointed this time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,3,,False,

Jet2.com customer review,10,2014-04-28,I am a regular flyer from Leeds/Bradford with Jet2.com and continually sing their praises for the service they provide for my short-haul journeys. Their website is user-friendly and given the flexibility of travel arrangements you will be pleased at the low costs but I hasten to add not the taxes etc. Like many I am relegated to travelling at peak periods and I object to the fare-loading by all airlines (including Jet2) however buses and trains wouldn't get away with it but airlines do. Whilst I travel frequently to Spain I can only express my complete satisfaction and have not personally witnessed any dissatisfaction from fellow-travellers. I do wish travellers would show restraint in their urgency to depart the plane once landed I hate the pushing and shoving as they retrieve overhead bags but how do you deal with that. Jet2 you have done a good job and your investment at LBA has done much to enhance the local economy in Leeds and Bradford and long may it continue. Well done Jet2.com 10/10 from me.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
Jet2.com customer review,,2014-04-21,My bad experience happened on March 18th 2013 from Newcastle to Alicante. I am disabled and requested help at the airport and to sit near the front of the plane. I have a doctors letter explaining my predicament but was told this was not needed. I was given a seat half way down the plane. Returning 25th March 2013 the same happened but this time I was given row 25 which for me is impossible and when I told the check-in staff I was told to sort it out on the plane which I did and was told there was no seats nearer even though I could see row 4 had an empty seat. I was humiliated in front of a planeload of passengers and that was after a 6 hrs delay. Needless to say I will never travel with them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,,1,,False,
Jet2.com customer review,3,2014-04-14,Initially booked a reasonable fare one way from Malaga to Belfast. Made the mistake by paying in euros as Jet2s Euro / Sterling rate is very uncompetitive only seen I could have paid in Sterling after I made the booking. We later decided to book on baggage this was expensive as it meant we had to pay for online check in as well but they do allow 22kg. In the end the whole ticket was more expensive than other options I looked at. When it came to checking in online the website allocated our 2 seats on opposite sides of the cabin meaning we had to pay yet more money to select seats so we could sit together. The flight left on time on an old Boeing 737 however the cabin seats have been refurbished however I found them very uncomfortable. No recline very thinly padded and little leg room. Cabin crew were very friendly however they made massive sales pitches for hot meals duty free and scratch cards with some announcements lasting a good few minutes. I didn't buy either as I felt I had already been over charged with the whole booking and online checking situation. When booking with Jet2 make sure you know all their hidden costs the seat allocation and online check in charge are unforgivable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,4,,,1,,False,
Jet2.com customer review,5,2014-04-13,My wife and I were on a flight from Leeds Bradford to Rome (Fiumicino). Flight out was very good and on time. However my wife has to be gluten free and we chose the meals very carefully. For her we chose the 'all day vegetarian breakfast' listed as GF and V. However the other bag containing the bread roll and the muffin was just the same as mine - i.e. normal! When you list the meal as okay for GF why is only part of the meal GF - when you are paying for it all! On the flight home back to Leeds the plane was delayed at no time was any information forthcoming on why and for how long we would be delayed. Not until we boarded the aircraft did the captain inform us the reasons behind the delay. Yes it was for reasons outside of Jet2's control - but how easy is it to communicate with the waiting passengers - very! My wife ordered 'Rich beef casserole' for the meal back to Leeds - again advertised as GF. Once again and we were ready for it this time it came with the same bag of crackers and bread roll and everything the same as I had been given. Once again it is advertised as GF when it is clearing not entirely GF. In this day and age when Gluten Free products are readily available and more often than not come in air tight long life bags can you not create a GF bag of bread roll crackers muffin etc. and put them in a different coloured bag that can be easily identified by the crew. It really is not that hard to do and we as customers are paying for meal - you are not giving it to us for free! Could do much better with regard to GF meals!,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,3,,True,

Jet2.com customer review,5,2014-03-27,Flew Jet2 to Gran Canaria outward journey was fine home bound journey was delayed 2 hours. It was a very old 737-300 and it obviously had a problem when the aircraft landed as it was not allowed onto the air bridge and had to park in the middle of the holding area. We were allowed to board as if it were on time then told the aircraft had a problem and all had to get off while the problem was fixed. To my knowledge not one person was offered any food or drink during the 2 hour wait not even a drink of water.

Had delays of more than 30 minutes each way sat on plane waiting for a battery for a wheelchair to be checked in as owner had been told on booking that the battery could go on board but on arrival at the plane was told it had to go in the hold. Plane full of passengers waiting with plane doors open for at least 35 minutes thought that was the end of it but on return exactly the same thing happened.

Jet2.com customer review,1,2014-02-20,I booked flights from Newcastle to Gran Canaria several months ago. I was later advised by Jet2 that we would be calling to collect passengers at East Midlands Airport on the way. That would increase our flight time by 1.5 hours and 1hr 50 mins on return. We requested a refund but were refused. Our flight to Gran Canaria took 6 hrs instead of 4 hrs 15 mins. On return we were made to queue in Las Palmas with everyone from Newcastle (we had online check in and drop off luggage). We were not allowed to buy duty frees because we were taken off the plane at East Midlands. On arrival at East Midlands we were taken off the plane queued to go through passport control marched in the rain from arrivals to departures sent through security and left to find our own way back to the plane. We boarded the plane flew to Newcastle and again had to queue for passport control. Our luggage arrived on the Krakow conveyor belt.

Fast efficient check in at the Jet2 dedicated desks. Aircraft a 737-300 well presented and clean. Requested three in-flight meals good value for money. Cabin crew looked the part smart and professional. On the return flight we received the same high level of service from the check in desk and cabin crew the toasted sandwich meal deal was excellent.

When trying to check in online on the 1st attempt it would not allow us to sit together. The only way it would let us do this is by paying more. 2nd attempt finally got the seats together. Check in was fine got to the plane and found it was a very old 737-300 at least 21 yrs old. The seats are hard and poor. The food on offer was rubbish. There is no sun visor on the windows either. On the way back there was no control at the boarding of the plane so everyone was stuck on the airbridge trying to get on. The same was offered for food. My question is if people do not drive around in 20+ year old cars why is an airline using planes that old. Maybe they should visit easyjet to see how to operate an airline and how to treat people.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,,,1,,False,
Jet2.com customer review,10,2014-01-13,NCL-TFS-NCL. Booked as part of a decent package deal for some last minute winter sun. We've often flown with Jet2 in the past and have often found them excellent and this was no exception. Their flights were very well timed so we weren't arriving into Tenerife at some god-awful time of night. The pre-flight add-ons weren't horrendously expensive and the website easy to navigate. We printed boarding passes at home which meant check in was a breeze. You can both outward and return well in advance but most passengers appear not to do this for reasons which are beyond me clearly preferring a lengthy check in queue rather than the (no queue) fast bag drop. Boarded and departed on time. Onboard warmly welcomed both directions by friendly experienced crew. The seats are not like sitting on a cloud but at 6ft tall they were fine even for me for 4.5 hrs. The additional god-send is the inability to recline which made the whole thing very bearable. We pre-booked hot food both ways which was very good and filled a gap. Bags waiting on carousel in Tenerife. Return much the same with zero queue at bag drop lovely staff and on time departure. The only slight snag was a 40 minute wait for bags in Newcastle. Overall Jet2 is a great company that is a clear example of company able to operate a low cost model while caring about its customers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,

Paid extra for legroom for but found sitting at the over wing exits a little cold. I prefer the allocated seating which avoids the usual scrum on boarding.

When we asked staff whether they could rectify this in Prague they said it was our fault for not checking in online despite the fact their system was down.

Jet2.com customer review,,2013-12-19,Recently flew with Jet2 from Leeds Bradford to Newark USA. What a catastrophe we flew on a 757 that was configured for trip to Majorca it was too small and hence too crammed. There was no seatback entertainment and the seats themselves were ridiculous for a flight of this length after a while it was like sitting on a park bench they were that hard! At one stage only one toilet was functional it was so bad it became laughable. All the time we were serenaded with how New York was a fantastic city but expensive so buy your spirits cigarettes and everything else on board. The flight attendants were ok but seeing one parading up and down the aisle chewing gum and occasionally drinking directly out of a water bottle showed a great deal of contempt for passengers.

I appreciate mistakes can happen and understand that they did not have a spare meal to give me but what annoyed me was I was offered a heated sandwich but I would have to pay for it where I believe it should have been offered free as a mark of good will for their error. The staff I found quite matter of fact and were quite annoying they said they would give me a customer care card so I could request a refund the staff had to be reminded on 2 occasions that I did not have this customer care card.

The cabin lights went off shortly after take off and as Jet2 planes do not appear to have any entertainment that was it for 5.5 very boring and rather uncomfortable hours. The cabin staff appeared with some coffee in plastic glasses as we were starting the descent and at row 29 the pilot or first officer announced cabin staff prepare for landing.

We paid £28 altogether for the 6 seats which was worth it! We were also told we could check in out hand luggage free of charge if we wanted to but we decided not to as we hadn't brought any other bag to carry through the airport. Boarding was quick and easy.

Jet2.com customer review,2,2013-10-25,Malaga to Newcastle 24th Oct 2013. After reading some of the reviews on this forum I begin to wonder if we were all on Jet 2 flights. I agree that they were on time cabin staff on both outward and inward flights very pleasant but the aircraft's were decidedly lacking in both space and comfort Why don't these airlines make it a bit more comfortable for passengers surely people would pay extra for a decent seat. We paid for extra legroom seat on the way out but could not book any on the flight home. Even with the extra legroom the hard plastic seat are a nightmare. I see that Jet 2 are now offering some long haul flights to New York and Boston it would be absolutely unbearable to travel that distance in on of their aircraft. No matter how cheap it was I would not consider a flight with them. Also this particular flight very stressful on the way back when just as we were about to land the pilot aborted the landing. This of course caused myself and others an anxious wait until the pilot eventually said that a bulb was not lit up on the control panel. Thankfully we eventually landed safely but apart from the uncomfortable journey the rundown state of their aircraft would cause me not to use Jet 2 again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,4,,,3,,False,

Had to stand for 30 minutes during the flight to get any feeling back in my legs and bottom. Next time I'm taking a cushion! Cabin crew pleasant and efficient. Landed 20 minutes early at EMA.

Jet2.com customer review,4,2013-10-13,Have flown with Jet2 many times and excluding take off delays we have always been satisfied with the service with Jet2 and loaned Titan aircraft - that was until 4 October when a Privilege aircraft was substituted from Palma. Jet2 should seriously review using aircraft from Privilege as this could seriously damage their good reputation - very old dirty and definitely not up to Jet2 standard.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,,,2,,True,
Jet2.com customer review,,2013-10-10,Flew back from Prague to Edinburgh the plane was older than me and sounded it. When taking off it vibrated terribly.

Jet2.com customer review,8,2013-10-10,LBA-BCN return. Another generally positive trip with this airline: elderly but clean and reasonably comfortable plane; friendly crew; punctual both ways.

Jet2.com customer review,5,2013-10-10,I opted to print boarding cards one month before our recent holiday in Tenerife and was astounded that my wife and I were split up on both outward and inward flights. I was even more annoyed when I asked at the baggage desk if it was possible to change seats at all. The girl on the desk said 'Yes no problem' as the seat next to mine was free. She changed my wife's seat so we could sit together but the sales desk (nearby) said the return journey was 'fully booked' so we'd have to be apart. Imagine my astonishment when the guy next to me on the return flight had only printed his boarding card a few days before he flew out (for one week and well after my BC print). This just stinks of Jet2's desire to charge extra for a guarantee to sit both of us together. Despite the cost of £1200 for a 10 day holiday they charge extra extra extra whenever they can. In addition to this both outward and inward flights were delayed.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,,,3,,False,
Jet2.com customer review,6,2013-10-09,We flew with Jet2 from Manchester to Heraklion on a leased Privilege airline to say it was tatty was an understatement. In fact it was a health and safety issue because the seating was falling apart and the upholstery being ripped exposed the steel seat structure. This was a issue with a lot of seats and the plane was also in need of a good clean. A poor start to our Jet2 experience. We returned 11 days later to Manchester on a Jet2 737-800 and this was perfect and very clean with great staff. This is the second time I have flown with Jet2 and I would give them another go but somebody seriously needs to take a close look at that flight with Privilege because it gives Jet2 a bad name.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,3,,True,

Jet2.com customer review,1,2013-10-03,Flew to Lanzarote on 26th September. Pre-booked seats 33b and 33c extra legroom as I'm 6ft 5 and very large framed. These seats were perfect with plenty of legroom. What they don't tell you is seat 33a is next to an emergency exit it has a big box attached to the door which means who ever is in that seat can't sit straight they have to sit on an angle. The hostess was nice and arranged a swap to seats 1E and 1F these seats were good with plenty of legroom. We had booked the opposite seats on the way back 33D and 33E again paying for extra legroom when we were leaving the aircraft on the outbound flight I spoke to the head air stewardess about the arrangements for the way back and could she arrange that the seats could be swapped to the same ones we went out on. On arrival a week later the lady came back saying nothing had been changed and there was already somebody in those seats. I decided to leave it to the flight crew to sort out as I had had enough at this point. Without telling anyone until we had boarded it was an airline called prestige with a completely different seating plan. There was no extra legroom. On seeing my seat I was devastated at the fact I was going to have to try and sit in there for 3.45 hours. I had to struggle to stand up again causing mayhem around me.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,1,,False,

Jet2.com customer review,10,2013-09-25,Our actual Holiday to Elounda in Crete was spot on as it was last year we have booked to go for 3 weeks next year. My complaint is about the return journey. When we arrived at Heraklion airport on 17/09/13 we were met by a jet2 rep who told us we would have to queue up outside the airport as the jet2 desk was very busy. We stood outside for 40 minutes then we were told to queue at desk 19 (20 and 21 were also being used). The queue never moved so we finally got hold of the jet2 rep who didn't seem to know what the hold up was. There was nobody processing anyone at desk 19. The rep came back after many more passengers had stopped her to find out what was going on she mentioned someone had got on a wrong flight and that was the hold up. We had to join a queue that was actually moving we spent an hour in the queue. Then went on to security which was about 20mins and finally up to the departure lounge where we had just purchased a coffee when we were told we had to board the aircraft. This was a total nightmare for us and everyone else on our flight LS514. Surely there must be a better system than the one that is being used at present.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,

Jet2.com customer review,10,2013-09-24,2 return trips from Newcastle to Ibiza in the past 3 weeks and once again found them excellent. First return trip both legs were flown on a Titan Airways A320 aircraft with a mixture of Jet2 and Titan Airways crew who were all very pleasant. Excellent legroom both outbound and return flights on time and the online check in service was easy to use and saved us a lot of time in the airport as we were travelling with hand luggage only. The 2nd return trip was taken with my wife and 8 month old son. Outbound flight on the same Titan Airways A320 and once again on time. Online check in was unavailable as we were travelling with an infant but I was still able to pre book my seats and check in was a breeze at both airports and took less than 5 minutes. Once on board our outbound flight we realised that the back of the cabin where we were was mainly rowdy youngsters off to San Antonio and at the front of the plane mainly families. Without us even asking and despite the flight being almost full the attendant told us row 8 had 3 spare seats next to each other and we were welcome to sit there once the seat belt sign was switched off. As soon as the captain allowed passengers to move around the cabin she came straight over and told us we could move down to the front and even helped us with our baggage. The return flight was on a Jet2 Boeing 737-300 and although it was clearly an old aircraft it was clean well maintained and once again on time. I really can't praise this airline enough and thankfully they are now the biggest carrier out of Newcastle meaning we will be using them many more times in the future and have indeed already booked to fly with them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,

Bought snacks on board not too expensive cabin crew ok on both flights - pleasant flights. The only negative point is looking at some of the people sat in the emergency exit seats ie pensioners god help if there was a emergency no way they could operate the emergency doors. Come on jet2 fit and able bodied people in Emergency exit seats.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
Jet2.com customer review,8,2013-09-24,This was the fourth time I travelled with Jet2.

Jet2.com customer review,3,2013-09-18,Chose to fly to Las Palmas recently from Newcastle rather than Glasgow as it was slightly cheaper. Check-in was good very quick and 22kg limit is appreciated. Flown before with Jet2 and been a pleasant experience but this time the in-flight service was very poor. Whilst the flights were on time the plane was old (27years!) and the crew were badly trained and inexperienced and safety was compromised on the return flight. On the outbound I'd arranged a champagne gift in advance to my partner and the crew were late in providing it and asked them if they had ordered it - completely lost the surprise! Many other food and drink pre-orders seemed to be given to the wrong people. Very slow food/drinks service and the crew spent most of the journey in the back galley chatting. Also both landings were dreadfully 'heavy'! Feel bad giving a poor review and not recommending in this case as previous experience of Jet2 from Glasgow has been fantastic.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,2,,False,

Two jet2 staff attempted to look after the whole plane they tried to get every passenger food and drink but didn't manage to get the whole length of the plane in 2.5 hrs mainly due to the non existent help from the Euro Atlantic staff even collecting rubbish was too much for them.

Flight times were good all flights departed and arrived earlier than expected. All staff - check in and cabin crew - extremely friendly and helpful polite and hardworking. Leg room was good (I have short legs but leg room on other carriers still leaves a lot to be desired). 22kg allowance is excellent for a low cost carrier. Also liked the fact that seats don't recline - a real nuisance on other aircraft if you are trying to eat or even balance a drink then someone slams their seat in your lap - not pleasant. Will definitely use again and can't recommend highly enough.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,

Took off on time going and hour late taking off on return due to fog in England but pilots made up half the time. Had breakfast outbound which was very tasty. Planes seemed quite new on both legs 737-800 and good leg room compared to some other nameless carriers! Only grumble was MAN airport on the Sunday morning. Took an hour and thirty mins to get bags and security dealt with. Never seen so much chaos in T1 with people running all over place trying to get flights.

Jet2.com customer review,,2013-09-15,Flight yet to be taken (in a week) but very poor customer service so far. Needed to take essential medical equipment (CPAP) - medical advice is to carry as hand luggage although not needed during flight. (Can't risk it being broken delayed or lost). Never had a problem with any airline taking this in the cabin as well as usual hand luggage previously - including the well known budget airlines. However Jet2 say that this bag has to be included in the hand luggage allowance and they say squash the medical equipment in a hand luggage bag or pay for a hold bag to put your usual hand luggage allowance in. I really would prefer not to have the need for this equipment in the first place but I think it is quite appalling that Jet2 's stance serves to increase the cost of a flight through this.

Compared to a few other low-cost airlines I find their website and booking process far superior the 22kg baggage allowance exceptional and the flight time much more pleasant - no getting up at 3.30am required!

Return Faro-East Midlands on the 30th August on ex Ansett 737-300 combi. Flight again on time. Aircraft pre-historic however well maintained and the interior was pleasant enough. Have no complaints as the flights were on time fares weren't particularly good and we did book early however that's the case with Faro and school holidays.

Very quick friendly and efficient. Flew on a 757 and there was far more legroom than we had anticipated. We had pre-booked a bottle of champagne for the outward flight and within 20 minutes of take-off a flight attendant asked when we would like it served and then even congratulated us on our anniversary when she brought it to us. There were even champagne flutes! Excellent service. Return flight was equally good prompt friendly and efficient. We had not booked a meal on the outward flight but had done so for the return. Our previous experience of budget airline food meant that our expectations weren't particularly high but we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the meal.

Jet2.com customer review,1,2013-08-29,Belfast-Palma-Belfast. Flew out of Belfast on time. We had pre-booked seats at the front so we could have a quick exit at Palma airport. The seats were very uncomfortable as they are padded and as you move the padding moves. The tray table is very small considering the size of boxes they use for their inflight meals. The meal itself was just ok with being very dry for a breakfast. The cabin crew where friendly but seamed to be force in flight services. Coming home from Palma was a disaster we were give 3 gates before getting the right one. Jet2 flights go out of terminal A. We were given gate A5 then A13 followed by a hidden gate down a set of stairs. Stuck on the plane 1 hour before departure the cabin crew were rude and slammed food in to your hands the meal was tasteless.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,,,1,,False,

I was rather concerned as I'm 6ft tall but I need not have worried. Whilst they are not the best seats in the world my knees didn't touch the seat in front. On the return leg the aircraft was far from clean with the floor littered with crisps but given the tight turnaround I suppose I shouldn't find this surprising.

Feel that perhaps the provider has changed but I certainly will not be ordering meals on board again. Otherwise have no complaints about Jet2 and have always had very good punctual flights. The only other issue was when waiting to be booked in with case in Dalaman (although I should only have had to go to bag drop as booked in online) desk closed without any warning and I stood in the queue for 1.5 hrs. Jet 2 rep present was unable to advise or assist and her manner was quite alarming in comparison to the other Jet 2 staff I have met.

Virtually no queuing for anything - check-in security or to board. Old plane (737-300) but had recently been refitted and looked good. Relatively cheap and good quality food (£3.50 for a sandwich).

Another hour before we took off. On the way back we didn't get through the gate until 15 minutes after the flight was due to leave we took off an hour late we sat through a 5 hour flight with no air con although we were told it was on but first time we could feel it kick in was when we started to descend in to Glasgow.

I cannot complain about the actual flight. It was on time and very comfortable good leg room and the flight staff were lovely and very helpful.

Clearly not normal. Much activity from flight crew. Captain came over the tannoy to say landing gear had dropped and we had to land. Circled Leeds for nearly 2 hours with the landing gear down to burn off fuel. Updates were given frequently.

Jet2.com customer review,9,2013-07-29,Flew to Dubrovnik on 27th June on the 6.55am flight. Check in was quick and efficient as was security check. Our cabin crew were lovely both pleasant and efficient. We had pre booked our seat numbers and both the actual seats and the leg room (we only booked ordinary seats) were very good. Seats were very comfortable with a holder for drinks in the back of the seat in front which is great and much safer than leaving drinks on tray. The leg room was great. We have had less leg room on long haul flights with bigger companies. The pre booked breakfast was good as was the hot pre booked lunch on our return. This was our second year with Jet2 and so far we have had good on time flights and very comfortable seats. Hope this continues as we have recommend Jet2 to family and friends.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,,,4,,True,
Jet2.com customer review,1,2013-07-28,Just back from Benidorm going from Belfast. Cabin crew were lovely when we landed we had to find out ourselves where to go when we eventually found the Jet 2 desk the girl was on her mobile so a queue started behind her she walked away after a 25 minute wait. Eventually found out what bus we were on. Left with a Spanish speaking bus driver. On return had to queue for 1.5 hours at baggage even though we had our boarding passes staff onboard were not very pleasant. First time travelling with Jet2 - never again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,,,3,,False,
Jet2.com customer review,,2013-07-28,"This company really needs to rethink their fee policy. I couldn't print out a boarding pass and the customer service rep said it was 23.50 Euros each just to print out a boarding pass. So we were charged the equivalent of 63 dollars to print out two boarding passes after we checked in online. It does state that there would be an ""additional fee"" but 23 euros is a bit much. On the same day we also flew on Easy Jet and had the same printing problems and they said the can print some out for us (for free) and had a wonderful experience.",False,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,,,2,,False,
Jet2.com customer review,8,2013-07-24,28th June Manchester - Malaga. Brilliant Jet2 Crew on a Titan airways flight with loads of leg room on time and no issues normal great service that we have come to expect on a Jet2 flight. Came back with Privilege Airlines again good flight on time but not as much room on this plane there seemed to be some issues with the Jet2 cabin crew and the Privilege crew not getting along. Otherwise again well done Jet2 far better than the other low cost carriers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
Jet2.com customer review,6,2013-07-24,GLA-FCO and return. Very friendly and efficient service at Glasgow check in with 4 flights going out within minutes of each other. Staff friendly helpful and really happy to set us off on a good holiday. Gate staff also very friendly and helpful and boarding was efficient and very prompt. The young cabin crew on the outward flight were professional and friendly. Nice flight but seats very basic and only really bearable for a short flight (I wouldn't go to Turkey or Tenerife with them but Rome was fine). Decent leg room though. Basic buy-on-board service (which I didn't utilise) was as standard for a low cost carrier; prices weren't too bad. Return flight fine again quite friendly handling agents in FCO and a friendly flight crew. Good updates from the cockpit both ways. Baggage arrivals prompt on both flights. If you get a low fare then they're perfectly fine for a short flight but if your fare isn't particularly low or you're travelling for longer than 3 hours I'd probably recommend trying some other airlines. But I'd fly with them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,5,,,5,,True,

Flight was on time at check in my checked in bag was over 22kg the person asked if we had hand luggage we had a small case she said to put it on the scales - both bags together were lass than 32kg so she booked my hand baggage along with my booked in bag at no extra cost I was most impressed with this.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
Jet2.com customer review,9,2013-07-15,Leeds Bradford to Split return flights were on time and very comfortable. Staff were cheerful on both legs of my journey chatty and helpful throughout. The guys on the return flight had been on the receiving end of a rowdy crowd on the way out to Split but they were in good humour with us in spite of having had a tough outward journey. Drinks snacks and pre-ordered meals all acceptable with a reasonable selection on the trolley. The seats are comfortable for this type of short journey and offer a bit more room than other holiday airlines so I have a preference for Jet2 over Thomson/Thomas Cook flights for holidays. Check in at both airports was trouble free. The facilities at Leeds Bradford were excellent too.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
Jet2.com customer review,1,2013-07-15,Manchester to Palma Saturday 29 June 2013. Travelled with family party of party 6 adults and 4 children. 45 Minute delay on tarmac on outbound as power connection failed before engines were started. Had pre-booked seats in rows 16 and 17. Flight experience ruined by boorish loud behaviour of one guy in seat 18D. His inane attempts to impress a group of girls were shouted in a loud voice. This went on throughout the flight despite me asking him to stop shouting on several occasions. The cabin crew were oblivious although everyone in the vicinity were making it perfectly clear they were unhappy. I reported to a flight attendant that he was shouting on his mobile phone after the seatbelt signs were on. She said it was OK as the plane had not pushed back yet you couldn't make it up. She was scared to tackle him!,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,4,,False,

Jet2.com customer review,,2013-07-07,We are frequent flyers with our 10 month old son and recently flew from Glasgow to Rome. I would never fly jet2 again as a result. Firstly at nearly £800 no sign of low fares secondly although we arrived 2.5 hours prior to the flight with only one person checking in (everyone else had apparently left to board flights) we nearly missed the flight. When we got to the gate which was closing there were 5 jet 2 staff chatting about their weekend! On board we were forced to wake up our child and sit him forwards for takeoff despite him being buckled in and sleeping already (although it wasn't enforced on the way back!). Staff are rude unhelpful and spend their time making loud announcements to sell you things although you cant hear the flight deck announcements. My advice there are lots of other carriers and Jet2 is one to avoid particularly when travelling with young kids.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,,1,,False,
Jet2.com customer review,8,2013-07-07,Just back from Menorca with jet2. The flight was one of the best I have been on. Staff were excellent and nothing was a problem. Plenty of leg room and a very comfortable flight. Have been on flights from the UK to USA several times and this was by far the most comfortable plane. Would highly recommend Jet2 and will definitely use them again. It's a shame they don't go to Colorado Springs.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
Jet2.com customer review,2,2013-07-03,Flight from East Midlands to Larnaca in Cyprus was on time for both legs. However this was probably the most uncomfortable flight I have ever experienced - poor legroom a hard and non-adjustable seat no headrest no storage in the seatback in front. This was a relatively modern aircraft - a Boeing 737-800. Do bear in mind that you are confined in this seat for over 4.5 hours to Cyprus and that's just the flying time! Staff were too busy trying to sell snacks drinks and duty free to attend to the filthy toilets - they even ran out of loo paper after an hour of flight. The final straw was flying in and out of East Midlands: Jet2 clearly use the cheapest most inefficient ground staff as to wait for well over 20 minutes for a bus to the terminal followed by over an hour to get the luggage after landing at 00.45 in the morning. The fact that there is only one other aircraft to unload smacks of inefficiency. The Jet2 staff on hand in the baggage hall were utterly useless and unable to communicate. Jet2 and East Midlands Airport - definitely never again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,,,2,,False,
Jet2.com customer review,10,2013-07-03,We left East Midlands on 14 May and checked in to be told the plane had changed we were still given leg room seats so fine seats were wider than normal low cost. Staff were nice and friendly. Coming home we were delayed an hour as again they had to change planes but I was in no particular hurry. Still again given leg room seats and this is why seat comfort got good instead of excellent. The seat belt was a tiny red belt that would only have fitted a child or someone very slim. We overcame that by sitting in the next empty seat.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,

Jet2.com customer review,,2013-06-28,Travelled with Jet2 many times before with my husband taking just one item of hold luggage and checking in on- line to keep costs down. Each time when we did on-line check-in our seats had been allocated together. However beware if travelling with hand luggage only. We flew to Malaga last month with just hand luggage. We went to check-in the day after on-line check in opened and surprise surprise one seat was allocated at the front and the other at the back. We left it a few days and tried again. Again you guessed right - we were allocated different seats but still one in row 5 and the other in row 18 even though there were vacant seats in the rows in front or behind on both occasions. We believe this is an underhand way of squeezing more money out of passengers. I would be interested to know if other people have experienced the same.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,2,,False,

Jet2.com customer review,,2013-06-23,We have just returned from a Jet2 holiday to Crete. Flight was dreadfully uncomfortable both ways. Return was made much worse by unruly child kicking my seat for a large portion of the journey. Not Jet2 fault but seats are so basic and uncomfortable. Flight on the way back the staff ran out of food we had pre-booked a meal but again same as on the flight out to Crete. Not value for money. The staff were not the best we have experienced.

Arrived at Palma airport to be met at baggage reclaim by a jet2 rep who directed us to the other end of the airport where we would meet another Jet2 rep who in turn sent us to a travel desk where staff gave us an envelope and sent us back along the airport to meet yet another person. Pointed in the direction of coach 229 which we eventually found and after some unclear dialogue with the Spanish coach driver boarded our transport. Totally unacceptable and completely different to the return journey at holiday end when we were accompanied by a jet2 rep from hotel to airport.

First time with jet2 and from booking holiday to the flight we found very good service very polite helpful staff and plenty of room on plane and reasonable priced food onboard eg: toastie and crisps £3.50. Only downside I find nowadays is that a lot of people are taking luggage on board and therefore there is not enough overhead space we were seated near the back of the plane and were waiting to depart at the back yet people were trying to go the opposite way to collect there luggage it was standstill until the crew told us to depart!,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,

Jet2.com customer review,,2013-06-21,Travelled on the same flight as the previous poster. LBA-IBZ. Forty plus men on a stag party seated all round the cabin. Some were drunk when they were allowed to board. As soon as the seat belt signs were turned off they were standing in the aisle making it impossible for people to use the toilets. The cabin crew were selling them drinks even though they must have known they were already drunk. In fact one man sat next to my partner managed to consume 8 gin and tonics and 2 Barcardi and cokes. They were rowdy shouting to each other and the cabin crew ignored them. I always thought that it was a criminal offence to be drunk onboard an aircraft but the cabin crew must have thought otherwise.

The four seats going out were together but surprise surprise on the return flight we were scattered all over the plane so another £18 was squeezed out of me.

Not the 18/30 brigade but grown men. Worse for drink when they boarded. Seated all round the cabin not together. Drinks trolley arrived with more alcohol. All shouting and standing in the aisle.

Jet2.com customer review,,2013-06-16,I have just posted an extremely positive review regarding Jet2 Staff based at Ibiza Airport. However on the downside we had a very poor outbound flight to Ibiza due to a group of men on a stag party. They appeared to have been drinking heavily before boarding the plane and were very loud throughout the flight which was not helped by the cabin crew supplying them with even more alcohol. The crew did not attempt to ask them to tone down their behaviour which made it impossible to hear any announcements from the cabin crew of the captain. Altogether a very disappointing performance from Jet2 cabin crew on this occasion.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,,,4,,True,
Jet2.com customer review,7,2013-06-16,We have just returned from a weeks holiday in Ibiza and we were caught up in the backlog of the French Air Traffic Controllers strike. As soon as we arrived at the airport for our return flight we were met by a member of the Jet2 staff who explained that our flight would be delayed and she would keep us appraised of the situation and in the meantime to remain in the check-in area or wait outside the airport on the grass as it would be more comfortable than in the Departure Lounge. This we did for an hour or so when the same lady found us to ask us to go through security and into the departure area as we had a time slot in 3 hours but would be available to board if an earlier slot came up. The service was first rate throughout our 6 hour delay. We have travelled with Jet2 on several occasions and have always found staff to be helpful and we will continue to use them until the other holiday companies get their act together.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
Jet2.com customer review,,2013-06-13,Delayed for hours due to strike at French ATC - not the fault of Jet2.com. The fact that a large group of men on a stag outing who had been drinking all morning were allowed on board and allowed to stand up all the journey and allowed to continue drinking and becoming more and more rowdy - was the fault of Jet2.com. The cabin staff chose to ignore their behaviour completely. One of these men was seated next to me and he was knelt up in his seat shouting laughing and swearing all the way to Spain - totally unacceptable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,2,,False,
Jet2.com customer review,5,2013-06-13,Flown twice recently and both times ended up paying for 2 seats together as free seat allocation would not allow 2 together. Found out that many people were the same. Despite empty seats on the plane whole families were dotted around sometimes with empty seats right beside them! This meant that people started to move around after take off. It also slowed down the service as families were wanting to pay for drinks etc together meaning that the crew had to run up and down with food/drinks/money etc. I think this is deliberate to push passengers into paying for seats.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,2,,,3,,False,
Jet2.com customer review,9,2013-06-12,3rd-6 June from Leeds/Bradford to Rome. LS331/332. The flights were excellent the planes seemed fairly new the staff friendly and professional. The flights were on time (a slight delay on the way back due to 2 late passengers but time was made up). The only slight complaint is that on the return journey for some reason (whether I was just unlucky) the seat padding was very thin and uncomfortable. Luckily I had a blow-up neck cushion with me so I sat on that! My score would have been 10/10 but I had to take a point off for the uncomfortable seat.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,5,,,5,,True,

Check in was very easy at Glasgow Airport the vouchers were self explanatory and easy to print off the staff were very friendly at check in and on the flight and at the resort. The leg room on the flight was brilliant and we didn't have to pay extra as this is the norm on the Jet2 planes. We also got 22kg of luggage allowance per person which is fantastic but even better than that if there are 4 people on your booking the combined allowance is 88kg which can be distributed over 4 cases.

Sadly flight delayed on return and not give much info as to reason. Nice planes with good legroom.

Jet2.com customer review,5,2013-05-29,Whilst overall travelling with Jet2 is adequate the Seats are the most uncomfortable I have ever had to use. The seats on the planes which we have travelled on are more suited to short haul flights and not for medium haul flights to Cyprus.

Quote: 'we noticed a technical problem on landing so will have to have it checked it should definitely be no more than 90 minutes we thought it would be better if you all return to the terminal building!' Off we trudged. Why not have the technical problem looked at before boarding? 6 hours later we again boarded only to be 'ordered' quite aggressively by the pilot to take our seats in 10 minutes otherwise due to 'duty restrictions' the flight wouldn't be able to take off!

Jet2.com customer review,,2013-05-28,Flew from Palma to Leeds on Saturday 25th May 2013. Departure delayed 12 hours from 11.05am to 10.55pm and during that time we were shown appalling customer service. Kept on board in fairly high temperatures for 3 hours with a small cup of water handed out and very little information. Eventually told plane would not be flying and so we had to get off. Put in a hot 'holding room' without sufficient seating and with no vending machines for food or water. We had all gone 9 hours without food and one small glass of water. By 4pm the plan was to schedule another flight meanwhile they planned to put us all on a coach to a hotel. At 8pm we were back at the airport and despite promises of a 9pm flight we didn't get on the (same) plane till 9.30pm only to discover once on the runway that there was now a fault with one of the doors and we had to return to the airport. This was fixed but then we were told we had lost our take off slot and had to wait another 30 minutes. In the end it was 10.55pm. Staff were nice enough.

Jet2.com customer review,10,2013-05-14,Return flight from Manchester to Pisa and can't speak highly enough of the airline. From online booking through to on time departures was all excellent. On our return flight last Thursday when about 30 mins from Manchester there was a problem with cabin decompression and the oxygen masks were deployed. The cabin crew remained professional and this kept passengers calm with no panic. We descended to 8000ft at which point the pilot came on apologizing for causing concern and thanking passengers for remaining calm. We landed shortly afterwards at Manchester albeit with a fire engine escort. All the crew including the pilots saw us off the aircraft and there were plenty of Jet2 reps at the carousel. Any airline can deliver in normal circumstances but we saw first hand how they coped when things go wrong and that's when you really do want them to deliver.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,
Jet2.com customer review,8,2013-05-14,"Glasgow to Faro (Portugal) on a package deal to Brisa Sol Aparthotel in Albufeira. Flight out was hassle-free and smooth the plane quite comfortable apart from the usual lack of elbow room. Where Jet2 fall down a bit is on arrival at the airport - on exit from the arrival area there should be a rep at the exit to point you to the Jet2 desk but if there was we didn't spot them. The desks themselves were over at the side wall of the exit hall in the opposite direction to the main doors so we had to double back to find them. Given somewhat vague directions to the bus park. Over main problem however was with the car hire arranged through Jet2 Car Rental. Flight back was OK although that plane was a little less comfortable than the outward flight - the seats seemed rather hard. We could do without ""Radio Jet2"" assailing us constantly while waiting for take-off though thankfully silenced during the flight. Overall fairly good experience would certainly use Jet2 again with just a little attention to detail could be excellent.",False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,4,,True,

Jet2.com customer review,10,2013-05-05,Flew with Jet2 to Malaga in August 2012. Check-In at Manchester is a breeze from the ground level check-in and staff are always friendly. From check-in to departure lounge always in less than 15 mins. Flown with Jet2 ten times in the past 7 years and flights have always been on time. Flew on one of Jet2's 737-800's interior of the aircraft brand new modern and comfortable with great legroom! Again service given by the cabin crew is excellent with good prices on food and duty free items. Flying with them again this year to Murcia and can't wait!

Jet2.com customer review,7,2013-05-05,Flew to Tenerife South and return from Leeds/Bradford Airport. Flight out had a short delay and the return flight more or less on time. The seats were really uncomfortable and lacked padding but leg room was OK for the 4 hours and a bit that we were in the air. Why is it that when Jet2.com allows large groups of same sex passengers they have trouble with them? This happened on the outbound flight with copious amounts of alcohol being sold to this particular group and then a member of the flight crew having to read the riot act to some members for the group for their use of bad language.

Jet2.com customer review,9,2013-05-01,Glasgow to Tenerife return. Checked in on-line with no difficulties easy bag drop at the airport. Boarding by seat number and fairly easy. Adequate leg room in 737-800 but the tiniest most uncomfortable arm rests imaginable (I had a constant battle with my neighbouring passenger for the use of the arm est!) good and pleasant service and with plenty of information from flight deck. Landing aborted about 1 mile from touch down after a very bumpy approach which certainly shut up the noisy drunk a few rows in front of us but the second attempt was smoother with a competent landing given the conditions. On return we were bussed to the aircraft this time a 757-200 which must have seen service in the Far East as the second language on the passenger warning signs was either Chinese or Japanese. Quite an old aircraft and comfortable enough but with the terrible arm rests. Twenty minute delay on departure with very little information from the flight deck throughout but arrival in Glasgow only a few minutes late. Good and pleasant service from the cabin crew and plenty choice for snacks and drinks. This was our fifth experience of using Jet2 and we would be happy to repeat the exercise. Perhaps seats are not as comfortable as easyJet's but added leg room does help.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,4,,True,
Jet2.com customer review,2,2013-05-01,Terrible flight Belfast to Lanzarote return. Jet2 use a 737 for this flight tiny plane so slightest sign of bad weather means you need to re fuel. Outward we were on Leeds Tarmac for 3 hours. Return stuck in Faro for 1 hour. Cabin crew said this refuelling happened on a Palma and a Murcia flight.

Cabin staff were pleasant and keen to help. The snacks looked better than the pre- booked meals. Flight deck information better than others and here I include Air China/Monarch/Qatar/Finnair. The seat pitch was also comparable to the aforementioned airlines. No IFE. The return flight was late leaving but arrived in Manchester some 15 minutes early.

On arrival in Dublin we were informed that we would be escorted to Belfast by coaches which would arrive at 11.30pm. All passengers were directed to an open shelter out doors (5c temp) at 10.30pm. There were a number of children and elderly and infirm passengers many of whom were suffering from exposure by the time the coaches arrived at 12.30am from Ballymena to take the passengers to Belfast.

Jet2.com customer review,5,2013-04-16,Jet2 is our budget airline choice but on a recent trip to Budapest we had to put coats handbags and duty free under the seat in front on both outward and return flights so that the overhead lockers could accommodate the outsize carry on luggage. It is time this was stopped. The check-in staff should be more vigilant. These people are trying to avoid the cost of putting luggage in the hold but why should the rest of us sit cramped up with no leg room on their account.

Jet2.com customer review,6,2013-03-22,Malaga to LBA. Old 737 showing lots of wear and tear. Although the inbound flight was early and boarding started 45 minutes before the scheduled departure time we still left late due to the fiasco of boarding a full plane. Row numbers for boarding were announced to get the passengers at the back on to the plane first but nobody could here what the Spanish ground staff were saying so everyone just rushed to get on. The size of carry on bags is now becoming a big problem for Jet2 and they need to police this better. At check in we were asked if we wanted to check-in one of our 'wheely' cabin bags for free which we were more than happy to do. But obviously most passenger didn't and it was just chaos! My main complaint is that you can no longer receive 'My Jet 2' points on any Spanish routes.

On outward flight booked extra leg room in seats Row 2 A&B a complete waste of money as you are up against the bulkhead of the toilet same situation if you book the Row 1 seats too simply no extra legroom! The seats however are just so uncomfortable the base has some padding but the back is like leaning against a plank of wood! After a 4 hour flight to TFS I had had more than enough! Return trip we had booked seats in Row 6 and indeed got the extra leg room which was ok but the seats are still so uncomfortable flight arrived half an hour late at Tenerife giving the excuse they had been held up by ATC as Tenerife was congested however the flight just about made the time up on the return so no real problem. All staff were well turned out and very helpful from the meet and great at the bag drop off the cabin crew who were attentive without being over the top trying to sell their wares to the flight crew who were very informative a real credit to Jet 2.

Jet2.com customer review,9,2013-01-08,GVA-MAN. Plane almost completely empty (around 18 passengers on a 737) and we would have left early had one passenger not boarded 5 minutes late. We missed our slot and were 45 minutes delayed). Obviously plenty of space but even if full I would have had no issues with legroom (and I'm 6ft 1). Welcome the 'no recline' seats which were comfortable for this trip. Cabin clean and fresh. Catering not too overpriced and cabin staff couldn't have been friendlier. Arrival into MAN parked at a remote stand but buses were waiting and we were in the Terminal 1 within 10 minutes of landing. Just managed to miss the Emirates A380's passengers at immigration or we would have had a long wait.

Jet2.com customer review,9,2013-01-08,I travel with Jet2 probably 8 times a year from EMA or Leeds Bradford usually to Barcelona Malaga or Tenerife. It's my preferred low cost airline largely because of those hard plastic seats! I fit reasonably well into the new 'skeleton' seats but I can also use the tray table which is unheard of on most flights where they get jammed on my front part way down. I'm not allowed in the exit row extra legroom seats due to being partly disabled so I appreciate a bit of room in the rest of the cabin. I've never had problems with staff or delays - although this could be the signal for a bad flight when I go to Tenerife in 2 days' time!

Jet2.com customer review,4,2012-12-06,Took charter flight with Jet 2 to Gothenburg. Quite possibly the most uncomfortable cabin I have flown in. This was due mainly to the solid plastic backed seats. As I am 6 foot tall my knees were forced into the solid back of the seat in front for the entire journey. On the plus side the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful. Despite this being a private charter flight with everyone on board on time we were still almost an hour late leaving Gothenburg due to waiting to be de-iced.

Jet2.com customer review,,2012-12-02,Booked holiday to Crete with Jet2 Holidays for a break for a week in August 2012. Once seated on the plane the row in front was empty (extra leg seats) which we would have considered purchasing had there been that option at the airport (we flew from Newcastle Airport). A couple then came onto the plane last minute and were told to sit in the extra leg room seats in front of us. It quickly became clear that the lady obviously worked for Jet2 in some capacity they got their drinks first which duly happened as soon as the plane was in the air. We were sat in the seats directly behind and it was over an hour before refreshments were offered to us! I have never experienced such shoddy and slow service on a flight in my life.

Flying home had a ham and cheese toastie with a packet of crisps and a bottle of water not bad price and keeps you going through the flight. Only issue I had is the fiasco of boarding the aircraft at Budapest Ferihegy - the airport was trialling a new scheme of boarding 3 Jet2 flights at the same time through 1 gate was bedlam.

Jet2.com customer review,,2012-11-19,We flew to Rhodes in July. We booked the flights the previous October to ensure extra legroom seats as my husband has replacement knees and needs to be able to stretch them. We booked seats in row 8 on the outward journey and in row 1 for the inbound. Once on the plane we discovered the seats we had booked were not extra legroom at all. We informed the cabin crew. They told us the aircraft had been re-configured and there was nothing they could do and that row 8 should be extra leg room but in this instance they weren't. Their only suggestion was that we could try to get our money back after the holiday! There was no apology and customer service was completely non-existent. My husband therefore had an extremely uncomfortable journey and actually wished he had refused to accept the seats and insist his bags were retrieved from the hold. On checking in for our return we were totally incredulous when we were informed that the aircraft had been changed and row 1 did not exist on this plane. So Jet2 had sold us extra legroom seats that did not exist! After a very long phone call with a long check in queue behind us we were finally given seats in row 5 which were extra legroom. We have booked with Easyjet to Rhodes next year as they are now selling extra legroom allocated seats.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,2,,False,

The cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Only slight niggle as that there were no sandwiches left when the trolley reached me.

Over 30 deg C in the aircraft on the ground before takeoff and despite assurances that the ventilation would start to function once the engines were on it was still 28 to 30 deg C in that part of the cabin for the whole of the flight. Intolerable really and extremely uncomfortable. Also the return flight was 2 hours late due to an earlier aircraft switch. Don't even consider sitting in the rear of their 757-200's.

There is insufficient space in the old style overhead bins for the hand luggage on board. On both flights 10 bags had no space and on MAN the cabin crew began writing surnames on paper hand towels before handing bags to the ground crew. Only a few baggage receipts were returned. Staff at BUD were much more professional but this still adds a 30 minute stressful delay to the boarding process.

Check in at Newcastle quick and efficient and onboard the young cabin crew pleasant. Although slightly delayed out of Newcastle we were only 10 minutes late. On the return flight we arrived 30 minutes early and the cabin crew were equally attentive. The only setback on this holiday was the situation at Paphos airport. We had to queue for 1.5 hours in a poorly air conditioned departure hall before we were eventually checked in. I believe this was the result of too few check in desks being available.

Outbound we were changed to a 'Strategic airline' onto a plane that had no hot water so only cold drinks were available. Furthermore one of our party pointed out to Jet2 staff that one female about to board was drunk (she had collapsed onto the floor in the queue to board). The staff response was ""she'll be ok after some coffee"". As no hot drinks were available that was a joke. Also the Strategic aircraft did not provide the extra leg room that our pre booked seats would have done. Whilst we all know that delays can happen one each way of a trip is too much. I suggested to a member of Jet2 staff that perhaps they should consider some new aircraft in view of what had happened and her response was ""well you'll have to start paying more"".

Uncomfortable seats very little choice re food options staff refused to take euros staff caused a fuss about me having only £20 note because they had no change. No entertainment (although you could buy an entertainment kit at £7) naive staff with very little experience confidence or charm.

Jet2.com customer review,2,2012-09-16,Flown 4 times with Jet2. On 3 occasions major delays - the latest was 5 hours plus return to 'wrong' airport the longest 24 hours.

Jet2.com customer review,1,2012-09-10,Having booked a round trip to Dalaman Turkey and pre-booked seats and online check-in we found that we were not given the seats that we had booked and paid for either way and the online check-in was a joke. We were told to use the normal check in desk at East Midland Airport and the same thing happened at Dalaman on our return flight. We have paid for pre-booking our seats £23-96 and we paid £24.00 online check in charge. It now seems that the only way that we can telephone to complain is by using a Premium Rate phone number.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,5,,,1,,False,
Jet2.com customer review,8,2012-09-10,Recently back from Palma. Flew from Blackpool. Checked in online the queue was a bit longer than I expected but no real problem for me. The staff there were helpful and friendly. The only downside of the airport itself is paying the airport development fee which as I was politely told by a Jet2 member of staff is on the Jet2 website when you book and paid to the airport and not the airlines. I must confess I missed the bit on their website that tells you about the fee when I booked but I looked again when I came back it was there so my fault for not reading properly. Apart from that I found the whole experience with JET2 rather good and would definitely fly with them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,,,4,,True,
Jet2.com customer review,7,2012-09-09,Flight to Rome from Glasgow was fine. Check in at Rome a nightmare not open when we arrived a long queue and no bag drop off open so we all had to wait on check in opening and then only one desk then eventually 2. Why did we print our own boarding pass when they took them ripped them up and issued new ones? Long queues at gate and a problem with a name on a boarding pass with someone in front caused a delay to get on the bus. Why do they say that only one bag and its to be a certain size when people come with suitcases. Not enough space to get them in though the overhead lockers. We were delayed for an hour because of a mistake with passenger list and see that is often a problem. Also these flights are not cheap they charge for everything.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
Jet2.com customer review,6,2012-09-09,I fly regularly with Jet2 to Murcia san Javier as they are the only company to fly from Edinburgh. On this trip the return flight was delayed by and hour which wasn't too bad. I always find Jet2 staff to be nice and helpful and have no real complaints other than their aircraft's are so old. I have been on and had gaps in the ceiling stuffed with kitchen paper to catch the drips of condensation. As a bit of a nervous flyer it doesn't fill me with joy when I see these things and puts me off flying with them.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,,,3,,False,
Jet2.com customer review,2,2012-09-04,Just returned with my family to Newcastle from Tenerife 15 hours late. Informed that aircraft had arrived Tenerife at 8pm having experienced an in-flight technical fault. Return flight at 9.30pm finally cancelled at 11.00pm. Parts we were informed being flown out from UK. Coached at 12.30am to overnight accommodation. Temperatures 28deg + but accommodated in non-air conditioned hotel in a very noisy resort. To Jet2's credit they flew out a replacement aircraft when it was found that the original aircraft could not be repaired as expected. This is the second 12 hour + delay we have experienced with Jet2 - and we've only flown with them twice!

Jet2.com customer review,10,2012-08-29,"LBA - Nice Return. Flown Jet 2 on a few occasions and have had absolutely no problems whatsoever with them. You have your major airlines and your budget airlines - in terms of experience I'd put Jet2 in the middle (better than your standard budget airline for the cost).

Jet2.com customer review,1,2012-08-28,We've flown 5 times with this airline - twice to Split twice to Hungary once to Tel Aviv. The flights have never ever left on time - delays have ranged from 30 minutes to two hours. The planes seem very old - on 4 occasions we flew in black and white. Seriously though - Jet2 have an ancient fleet compared with Easyjet or Ryanair and the planes have a higher rate of mechanical problems as a result. Our return flight from Budapest was the last straw - our first attempt to land in Budapest was aborted because of problems with the landing gear. So - ancient planes frequent delays. Use Ryanair or Easyjet instead.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,2,,False,

Jet2.com customer review,1,2012-08-28,Flight from M/cr to Paris for our honeymoon. Outward flight fine. Return 5 hours late. Informed of this half an hour before boarding was due. I asked what the reason for this delay was and was told by an extremely aggressive staff member that it was due to a plane breaking down in Nice. We took this flight as it was supposed to arrive at 19h25 on the Monday. We both had work 05h30 the next day and we also wanted to arrive early enough to catch a train home rather than pay for a taxi. We arrived home at half one in the morning having handed over £60 to a taxi driver. Don't risk it.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,1,,False,

Flight was early outbound friendly cabin crew at the door and gate to assist you to your seats inflight entertainment was portable televisions you paid £7 for the full flight which was decent. Landing in Heraklion was fine baggage came quick and the cabin crew said goodbye and thank you to everyone. On return the engines failed at the runway so we could not depart the air conditioning was broken so everyone was wafting the Jet2 safety cards which made a racket and when the engines started and air con was fixed we departed and the captain apologized and offered everyone a free drink!

Jet2.com customer review,2,2012-08-23,Travelled with husband and our parents from LBA to Malaga 15.8.12 - 22.8.12. Outward journey delayed 45 mins due to faulty aircraft - inward journey delayed 3 hours due to aircraft breakdown. On way back people sent to gate to queue 1 hour before boarding - hot and uncomfortable in boarding area. We had to queue again in the walkway to the plane - very hot - no need for that number of people to be herded inside as boarding was in stages and staff could have waited until the walkway was clear before sending next customers. Attitude of staff - dreadful. Communication - dreadful. Will never use this airline again - just not good enough.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,,,1,,False,

Jet2.com customer review,8,2012-08-22,MAN-FCO. I have never heard of Jet2.com until we travelled as a group on company ticket. It seems to be the only airline connecting Manchester and Rome directly.

Jet2.com customer review,10,2012-08-19,Manchester to Dalaman July 2012. Both flights on time. Very friendly staff. Same staff on return flight two weeks later and still very friendly. Clean and modern planes. Paid extra for extra leg room on outbound journey (rows 1-8) and these were really comfortable. In row 11 on return journey and this was equally as comfortable. More leg room than Thomas Cook flight I did recently. Would use again and would recommend.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,4,,True,
Jet2.com customer review,7,2012-08-14,Return to Palma in Majorca from Manchester Airport. Got to the departure gate and was pleasantly surprised to find a fairly small queue made easier because it was allocated seating so not the usual big scramble you get with Easyjet. Although we hadn't paid for extra legroom they upgraded us to the emergency exit row to accommodate another large group. The only drawback was that we were by the only working toilets on the plane so had a queue of people stood by us all flight.. The seats weren't particularly comfortable and I wouldn't fancy more than three hours in them. The plane was a refitted 757-200 which must have been about 25 years old. Flight was pleasant enough with drinks and snacks not too extortionate and we had a sandwich on the return leg which was more than passable. Had the very rear seats coming back which were more cramped and would be painful for people taller and wider than us. Both flights were on time and all the crew were helpful and friendly. Certainly better than Ryanair although the age of the fleet means the flight wasn't as comfortable as Easyjet.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,3,,True,
Jet2.com customer review,1,2012-08-12,Booked our flight and seats from LBA to Cyprus - paid for extra leg room and the 6 seats together arrived at the airport to find our seats had been reallocated.

Jet2.com customer review,5,2012-08-09,On a flight Manchester to Venice I had booked to do online booking and as such only paid the £20 per suitcase. I then discovered I was unable to get onto the website I contacted my booking office who said they had put a note on my booking that would enable us to check in at the airport free of charge. 3 days before we left I again contacted the booking office and was assured all was dealt with. On arrival at Manchester the queues were piling up and the minute we got to the check in we stopped our queue completely. The note had not been put on the booking she knew nothing about it and wanted extra money from us. I showed her the email but she didn't have authority to pass us on. After 20 minutes the supervisor arrived and agreed we should pass through no money to pay. She asked the girl to put a note on our booking for the return journey. Our return journey from Venice everyone arrived 3 hours beforehand hot with nowhere to sit. I dreaded getting to the desk! We were all fed up of waiting around in a space that was far too small for the queues. When our turn came the girl asked us for money as we hadn't paid at Manchester either! Yet again out came the email which she read after much deliberation she also let us through.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,3,,False,

When we arrived at Manchester airport we were advised that Jet2 had sub contracted this flight to a Spanish airline and that the plane was still in Madrid. When we boarded the plane it was obvious that there were no seats with extra leg room. Return flight exactly the same.

On the 7th July arrived back at the airport at 6.45pm for our flight (LS228) at 9.20pm to find our flight was cancelled until 3.45am the next day. Given a ten euro voucher for food each. Told flight was delayed due to the bad weather the previous evening in Leeds. Eventually flew at 5am (7 hrs 50 mins delay).

Jet2.com customer review,9,2012-08-02,I've just returned from my first Jet2 package holiday. Unlike most packages we weren't pestered with holiday reps trying to sell trips. My only complaint was that when we got to the airport we were sent to the coach - we hurried in case we were keeping them waiting as my bag had been the last off the carousel. We sat on the bus for 40 minutes. When we were eventually about to set off to the hotels I asked the rep what the hold up had been. She said we'd been waiting for another flight to come in! I wouldn't have minded if she'd told us we'd be waiting all that time but just to leave people sat around is not acceptable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,

Onboard prices are comparable with U2/FR/TCX and the crew were friendly enough. Return left SXF 10 minutes early and arrived in LBA 30 minutes early with friendly crew with little upselling. The seats and legroom are fine for the short sectors we flew the planes on both legs were clean and perfectly up to the task.

Jet2.com customer review,9,2012-07-25,Manchester to Rome on flight LS791 on May 3rd 2012. The flight was good the plane was tidy we departed and arrived into Rome on schedule. Booked this flight on March 11th and noted on the booking confirmation that we needed to print our booking pass's from 28 to 5 days before the flight or pay an additional charge. We went to Australia and returned to NZ just before our departure date in April to find computer problems did not allow us to print the boarding pass. We were charged pounds sterling 17.50 each to print out the boarding pass which I feel is steep after you have already paid pounds sterling 46.07 covering online booking fee reserved seats fee payment card fee booking fee. We knew we were in for a further charge due to circumstances not allowing us to comply with the check in directive on the booking confirmation but after paying pounds 46.07 already we did not expect to be fleeced with another cost of 35 pounds. 10 pounds would have even seemed high as this was the online booking cost. It is a pity that what seems a good airline and certainly one who provides in our opinion a good flight could loss clients by boarding costs they wish to charge.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,2,,True,

As a matter of interest I've checked subsequent flights each Sunday since the start of June and the average delay is between 30 and 40 minutes.

Jet2 knew about this at 06.30 hrs yet passengers only notified at 09.50 hrs when many were in boarding area and unable to return to other side of barrier. Staff unhelpful and couldn't seem to care less. After much cajoling eventually Jet2 staff agreed to escort us back through passport control and security. Offered a 6 euro voucher - hardly adequate.

Jet2.com customer review,2,2012-07-15,Truly awful customer service. Got a return trip from Manchester to Prague. Outbound flight delayed by an hour due to an aircraft fault - not so bad as it was a Thursday early evening flight so didn't impact too much on the trip. Cabin crew were helpful and friendly. Return leg on Sunday evening due to depart at 20.05 was delayed by 5 hours and we were only told about this half an hour after we got to the airport. They knew about it the previous day because it was caused by an aircraft going completely out of service in Gran Canaria. So standards of aircraft maintenance are obviously not the greatest! In total we had to spend 7 hours in Prague airport and all we got was a 255 Kc voucher each worth about £7. The airport restaurants are expensive so this didn't go very far. Eventually got home at 3am when we both had to go to work the next day. The very least they could have done is text or emailed us when they knew they'd be an aircraft down 24 hours before the flight and we could have spent more time in Prague. I got a text at 20.08 three minutes after the flight was due to take off. Brilliant. Never flying with this lot again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,3,,False,

It was an hour late taking off due to a problem with the remote air conditioner. The plane was stifling hot and when people asked for a drink of water the cabin crew refused.
