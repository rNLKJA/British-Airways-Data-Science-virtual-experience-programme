"""reject children and elders to go to Priority""",2,2022-11-18,"Everything is perfect for an economy airline, it's much better than Vietnam Airlines by service, flight attendants, and seat quality.

But, when checkin with Bamboo Airways in Sydney, the head manager reject children and elders to go to Priority line, claiming that ""if the flight have 150 children, then we have to serve you all in this priority line""!

"""Would not recommend this airline""",1,2022-10-17,"Would not recommend this airline to anyone. Firstly, my luggage was lost when flying from the UK to Vietnam, and the airline was not helpful in keeping me updated on the progress locating my luggage. I finally received it about four days after initially landing in Hanoi, and was told that I would be eligible for $30 compensation as I needed to purchase essential items that were in my checked luggage. (The price of these exceeded $30, even for essential toiletries, but this was all they were willing to compensate.) However, they are unable to transfer the money to me; the two options are to either get it sent to a Vietnamese bank account, or to collect it in cash in Vietnam. As an international traveller, I do not have a Vietnamese bank account, and I was not informed of the option to collect the money in cash before leaving Vietnam. Therefore, it seems impossible to get my compensation. Second, the food and drink options on board are extremely limited, and despite trying to request vegetarian meals a number of times before checking in there were no options on board, apart from one pot of instant noodles over a 12 hour flight. Furthermore, you are only allowed one alcoholic beverage at meal times, and there is no option to purchase additional drinks.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Hanoi,August 2022,2,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,False,

Portions were small so an hour after eating I was starving (I weigh 50kg and do not eat much). Other passengers felt the same and staff made pot noodles when requested - so most the flight was engulfed in that nasty pot noodle smell. Dinner was served unannounced an hour and a half after take off, and then nothing until breakfast an hour and a half before landing.
