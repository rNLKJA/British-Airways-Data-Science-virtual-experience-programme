"""constant maintenance issues""",1,2022-10-09,"This airline has constant maintenance issues, the plane on arrival lost one engine. The replacement plane came in late, we were told they were in touch with the connecting airline, someone would be getting us from the plane and immediately escort us to the connecting flight. They confirmed multiple times that the connecting airline would hold. When we landed, we saw the connecting flight pull away from the gate. The connection was only available once per week. They would take no responsibility, we had to buy a ticket to another airport (Fort-de-France) to catch a connection to our destination the next day. Change fees, extra ticket, hotel for the night, taxi, food, etc. cost us $500 per person. Air Antilles lied to us every step along the way and did not cover a penny of the extra expenses they were responsible for. Do not fly this airline.",True,Viking twin Otter,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Pointe A Pitre to Fort de France,October 2022,1,1,,1,1,,False,
"""This airline is disgusting""",1,2019-08-11,"Point-à-pitre to Saint Martin. This airline is disgusting. They have no respect for people or their time. They are the most unhelpful and rudest people we have ever encountered on an airline. They were unwilling to help us try to book an earlier flight, after discovering the plane was delayed two hours which would have made us late for an unexpected funeral we were to attend. Then, even though it was two hours late, they still made us go into the boarding zone, where there was no food and only warm bottles of water in an expensive vending machine. Once, the plane was finally nearing boarding time, they announced another hour of delay. Delays are common and sometimes unavoidable, However, the rudeness and complete lack of help is unacceptable. We not only felt like we were receiving attitude because we were white, we also just felt that they didn’t feel like dealing with us because they were too busy eating lunch. Unacceptable. Do not fly with them. We should not be giving them our hard earned money.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Point-à-pitre to Saint Martin,August 2019,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,False,1
