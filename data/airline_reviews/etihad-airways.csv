"""they reimburse only hotels in Abu Dhabi""",1,2022-11-16,"Me and my wife booked a flight from Melbourne to Greece with Etihad for November 11, 2022. After spending several hours in the plane, the flight was finally cancelled and at 3AM they told us to look for a hotel ourselves, something we did. The next day we went to the Etihad desk at Melbourne airport and they told us that we will get reimbursed for our hotel expenses (two tickets stayed in one room). They told us to submit the papers through their website. One the 12th we flew to Greece with Emirates and arrived on the 13th. I have been trying to find the forms and the site to submit the necessary paperwork but after two days I was not able to discover anything. Today I called their customer service in Greece and in Emirate and the amazing answer they gave me is that they reimburse only hotels in Abu Dhabi! I told them this was not fair since I am not asking any compensation for the over 24-hour delay involving two passengers but only to pay for my hotel. The answer was still the same no compensation for hotels outside Abu Dhabi. Conclusion: Etihad lied to me in Melbourne about hotel compensation. They did absolutely nothing for the long delay.

Food was extremely good: the menu is not that extensive but the quality of every dish is very high. You can order anything from the onboard menu, at any time. Pajamas provided are designed by a local Emirati brand A Friend Of Mine: drawing inspiration from traditional Emirati dress, I found these pajamas to be incredibly soft and comfortable. Amenity kit is stocked with Acqua di Parma products. In my opinion, this First class product is much better than Emirates First. Some areas of improvement: no amenities are offered in the toilet; WiFi quality and speed could be better (First passengers are given 200MB for free); champagne could be enhanced (Etihad serves Charles Heidsieck 2006, both Brut and Rosé, while Singapore Airlines, e.g., serves Krug in First).

Every time I travel they stop me at the counters and check my residency card for at least an hour, making me catch the flight literally in the last minutes before takeoff. One could argue that it's a standard procedure, but seriously it takes you an hour to verify an ID card rightfully issued by German authorities? Another thing that always happens is delays.

"""worst experience was my Inbound journey""",1,2022-03-13,"Not much issues with the Outbound travel, except the flight crew attitude. The worst experience was at my Inbound journey. Let me start from the beginning On my flight from Cochin to Abu Dhabi, I had to wait for almost 1.30 Hrs. to get OK to Board. As you aware on arrival UAE visa is available for all US Green card holders. However the ground staff keep staying they need an OK to board. At last they manage to resolve that issue and I paid $100 for my additional baggage for Cochin to Charlotte. Again the flight crew experience was not good. In my Inbound travel there was a stopover of 2 days at Abu Dhabi. Due to Covid issues , I called the call center and make sure the reporting time is 3 hours prior to departure. On 6th morning I reached the departure Terminal at 6.30 AM, There was a long queue and all flights check in was done through the same counter. That looks weird to me. Usually there is a separate counter for each flight. The line was not moving so fast, so I report to your ground staff that my flight is for US, I have to do multiple immigration. The response is to stay in line At 8.00AM they called me and sent to separate counter for check in. Again in that that counter I have to wait for 15 minutes to get my turn. Check in staff verified all papers and visa Docs, then they advise me to pay $100 again for additional baggage. I told them that I already paid that money at Cochin and showed the receipt. Check in staff escalated that issue to her supervisor (that took another 15 minutes). Supervisor insist me to pay another $100 for additional baggage. Due to shortage of time, I couldn’t argue with them and agreed to pay. She sent me to another counter where I handover my US Visa credit card. He can’t process the payment in that counter due to some access issues, so he sent me back to the check in counter again. That exercise went 3 times. At the end I have to exchange the dollars in wallet to settle the payment (lost almost $15 on money exchange). At last they released me from the check in counter 45 minutes before flight departure. Literally I had to run to complete the immigration formalities. Again the flight crew experience was not good from AUH to JFK At JFK I got an announcement from Etihad staff that I can collect the luggage only at my final destination I got only 1 check in baggage at charlotte out of 2, 2nd one I got on Saturday morning (Jan 8th).",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cochin to New York via Abu Dhabi,January 2022,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",1,1,,False,1

After running around like mad trying to get assistant, a gentleman from Etihad advised I go to my next flight as it is the same aircraft that I had left with my items which I will be boarding again. I spoke to airway employee who told me he had in fact, found the bag and gave it to Lost and Found but said it is too late for me to get my item. He suggested when I get home Sydney (which is the flight I was boarding to) and try to contact Etihad to retrieve my item. I got home and called Etihad help centre in Belgrade who advised that they can make an exception and send the item back to me. I immediately filled out a file and received an email from Etihad Airway that they can send the item back to me. I responded back within a few minutes but I received no further follow up email. After an hours wait I then contacted their Facebook page and the contact person said there is nothing they can do. I got mixed messages from them on my item. It was disappointing to be jerked around and not being told clearly how to retrieve my item. I believe if I had received proper support I would have been able to get my item back within the airport (as I had 2 hours to spare). I will never fly or recommend Etihad again if this is how they handle customer issue.

"""great dissatisfaction""",1,2019-06-15,"Sydney to Frankfurt via Abu Dhabi. Having flown with Etihad for the 1st time, I was initially satisfied. However, my 1st impression has been completely broken and now find myself writing this review in an attempt to express my great dissatisfaction and treatment upon my last booking with Etihad. I booked a flight from Sydney to Frankfurt for my Australian wife. At this time I was unsure about her visa conditions in Germany, so I called Etihad asking how I should make her booking. The Etihad agent informed me that because my wife didn’t yet have the long-term visa, that she need to book a return ticket within 3 months after her arrival, otherwise she wouldn’t be allowed to board the flight to Germany. She then recommended to book a return ticket, as a classic or flex, to have low or no cancellations cost. I proceeded to book the “deal” ticket for the outbound flight and the classic for the return flight. Once we arrived in Germany and my wife was granted her visa, so I then called Etihad to cancel the return flight as already having previously explained I would do. That’s when the cycle of disappointments started. I was told the 1st time that in Etihad’s policy “Most restricted refund fare rule applies in the event that different fare choices are combined” and that my flight is not eligible for cancellation, since I “automatically agree when booking a flight”. I replied that I wasn't told this condition and that I should book either Classic or Flex. I was then answered that an investigation process was being started to check this call and they will contact me. After over 1 week of waiting, I called Etihad again, just to be told that they only traced the last 2 calls, but not the 1st one I made, which is where I was given the wrong instructions. I was told again that they would start another investigation and that they would call me back. After several weeks, again there was no call back as promised. I’m therefore extremely disappointed by Etihad’s customer service. After my most recent call to Etihad, I was told that they couldn’t find the 1st call and starting an investigation and that I would receive a call back. At this point I don’t know if I should laugh or cry? Etihad finds 2 calls, but not the 1st one, even though I provided date and timing, and it was due to that call that I was wrongly informed and proceeded to book the return ticket. Otherwise, I would have never bought the return ticket. It was totally wrong to advise me that I need to buy a return at Etihad to prove that my wife will leave the country within 3 months – since I could have booked a flight to London for less than 50 Euros (having been told this by the immigration officer later on). Also, I would have not bought the ticket for 1100 AUD, if the agent had told tell the canceling conditions, and I made it very clear that I would be cancelling the return flight. Apart from that, the booking process itself was extremely misleading. If you book a return flight, and chose the outbound flight deal for one way and the classic for the return, it is then clearly shown on the return flight that it can be canceled. So there is absolutely no indication that “Most restricted refund fare rule applies” from the beginning till the end of the whole booking process. But it's so easy from an IT point of view. This is misleading the customer when you don’t have such important information which changes the prices for cancellation.

That being said, I found Etihad to be mediocre at best. At least they were fairly on time and make an effort to be. I found that the seat pitch at 30 inches meant that legroom was compromised. That extra 1 inch makes a lot of difference, and I found the offerings on competitors to be at least decent at 31-32 inches, which is perhaps more ideal for long-haul flights. I would be referring to competitors like Qatar, Emirates, Turkish, Finnair etc. They also seemed stingy with the food & beverage & snack service as others have mentioned - hence I wouldn't elaborate. What really irritated me more is that the dhow-shaped tray that the food was served on has absolutely zero purpose other than aesthetics and it kept slipping down my tray table. Super irritating. Many passengers were also irked that the IFE system (specifically the movies & TV) is turned on only after the main ascent & will be shut down before the main descent. That's an hour of IFE gone.

Our first meal out of Sydney consisted of a poor quality warm meal, a cold, hard roll in a packet, and a packet with a slice of cake and a plastic cup of drink of our choice. There was an announcement and also a brochure of the snacks you could purchase. All prepackaged chips, nuts, noodles in a cup, etc. No salads or sandwiches, or quality warm meals. Once the meals trays had been removed the cabin crew disappeared. No crew came with drinks. After an hour or 2, I was very thirsty and wanted water and my husband wanted a cup of wine. He pressed the crew call button at least 4 times, (which turned off by itself after about 10 minutes each time). No crew came. So we went to the galley where there were 3 staff. One was eating her meal, the other 2 not appearing to be doing any specific work. I was allowed to take a cup of water. My husband was told to wait for a while. While waiting politely at the galley, with the staff just standing / sitting there, another man came up and asked for a plastic cup of wine. He too was told to wait. About half an hour of waiting at the galley, with the crew, he was finally given a cup of wine. During the middle of the flight a pack of sandwiches had been given out. As I had been asleep when they were being distributed, when a crew member did walk past, I asked if I could have some sandwiches. She questioned me as though I was asking for a second helping. On the flight from Abu Dhabi to Dublin, an announcement was made they would be serving us a ‘complimentary meal’, after which we could purchase from their onboard snack menu. We were presented with a cold soggy bread roll and a drink. I asked for a glass of wine with my meal, and the flight attendant said he would come back with it, which didn’t happen.

Next, is the WiFi. Onboard WiFi is an absolute joke. I paid $5 USD for 30mb of data. This allowed me to essentially check my email quickly browse no more than a couple of web pages before it ran out.

No toothbrush, no eye mask. I was starting to feel like I was flying a budget airline which by the end of my trip I had come to the realisation that, I was in actual fact flying an Emirates wanna be airline. Food. Food was absolutely terrible. Surely you would think you could simply check your seat pocket to see what you can expect for your couple of meals on such a long flight? Wrong. We were presented with ""Chicken or Beef"" most of the time. No idea what we were actually being served, and the food is not labelled. I guess they do this so that you can instead pay extra and buy from their new inflight menu if you want any decent food? Another telltale sign of a budget airline. Long story short.

Seat selection during booking or check-in is only available 24 hours before the flight for free, or otherwise with additional cost of 30 EUR/flight. The irony is that the system automatically placed me on a seat in the first three rows of the aircraft which is coming for higher price if you want to book that seat. I prefer to have a window seat in the two last rows, as often the other seats remain empty and i get a full row. This would be a cheaper seat. Still for changing the seat i was charged the full amount. Food: The new trays are pathetic, they don't lock with the tray table and slide on the tray table all the time. They are very small, so they can hold a ridiculously small portion of food.

Lounges closed, no customer service, they redirect business class passengers to the call center because the local staff at check-in and gate can not even answer basic questions. My family and me, including our two kids (10 and 5 years old), booked a trip through a travel agent with Etihad Airways, including four business class flights from Frankfurt, Germany, and hotel in Abu Dhabi. We were able to check in online without any problems (we entered all passport information, including passport expiration date, and were not informed of any problems with the passport). After arriving at the airport today, we were also able to go to the gate without problems— but then we were refused to board the plane, because two of our passports were only valid for another three months, not six months as seemingly required by the Abu Dhabi authorities. We acknowledge that it would have been our duty to inform ourselves better before traveling, though given the acceptance of the passport in Etihad’s travel systems it definitely made it hard, if not impossible, for us to spot our honest mistake. But, and that’s really the big problem here where we believe Etihad treated us horribly as customers, when we politely asked your ground personal to rebook the two of us (me and my younger son) to the flight later in the week, enabling us to get a new passport, they refused and gave us a tiny piece of paper with the comment ""just call our call center"": Seriously, Etihad, is that how you treat your business class customers? And all of this despite them seeing first-hand our 5-year old crying and crying, since the only thing the little guy could understand was that we were not allowed to go on vacation. But it got even worse: The call center also refused to change the booking, unless we were willing to pay a rebooking fee of over $4.500 for just the two tickets. Given that we initially paid over 8.000 € for our tickets, this sounded like an insult more than anything else to us. Ground person pressured us even further to quickly decide, obviously keen to depart soon, so under massive pressure and with no ability to weigh our options, we had to stay in Frankfurt, and did not board the plane. Our vacation was destroyed, both of our kids cried for hours, until we then found a last-minute hotel at Frankfurt airport (the incident happened in the late evening). Overall, the most unpleasant experience I ever had with any airline in my life, and I have made hundreds of flights. And it seems I am not alone, looking at the web, I found hundreds of bad reviews.

They left this bit out actually - I just saw it on the re-issued travel documents much to my dismay. In total I lost a day and a half of my trip. My trip was about 19 days in total so to lose that much time was considerable. I had to change hotel reservations, cancel plans to visit a certain location (because of the time I lost), travel an hour home, travel an hour back the next night, wait again to check in hoping I wouldn't be stung a second time.

I went all the way to the payment page, went ahead and paid (perhaps I should have paid more attention to the final amount, but it was not clear and I was in a rush to book). Only after finishing the booking I realized I was charged $30 for one seat and $10 for the other, I have never paid for selecting a seat, and these seats would have been free at check-in. Realizing I paid for seats that I did not want to pay for, I contacted Etihad by email asking for a refund of the seat payments. After several back and forth emails, they refused to refund my money. They claim it was clear on the site that these seats were chargeable. I have a relative who also fell for this deceptive seat selection process and also paid for seats without realizing. It is bad enough that they charge for seats (given that are apparently not a budget airline, although you could argue this now), but to deceive their paying customers into paying for seats they did not want to pay for, and then refusing to refund the payment (regardless of who was at fault) is disgraceful! Further evidence of Etihad's greed and lust for money from their customers, with so many examples like this in recent years. The icing on the cake- today I wanted to change a booking I made with miles, and the only way to make this change is to contact the call center. Previously to call Etihad, you dialed a 02 number, which was a local number that was charged at a local rate. However, in line with their money hungry ways, they have now changed their call center number to a 600 number which is charged at a premium per minute rate.

"""extremely poor and stressful""",1,2019-03-20,I flew Business Class on Etihad flight EY484 from Abu Dhabi to Brisbane [12th March 2019]. The Business Class experience with Etihad was extremely poor and stressful. The cabin crew were less than helpful. The cabin manager introduced herself but gave no advice on how to operate the seat or any of its features especially as the seat mechanism was different to business class seats on other airlines. The flight departed late in the day from Abu Dhabi and so the cabin crew were serving meals virtually from the time the aircraft left the ground but I was kept waiting for my first course until the crew was dimming lights and putting everyone to sleep. The steak was uncooked and blood oozing from the meat was turning the potato dish pink. I tried to contact the cabin crew but they said they were too busy and would come back to me later but they did not. I persisted as I was hungry and when I complained I was told that chocolate ice cream only was available which basically was my dinner that night as everything else had gone. I wasn’t given any other food until breakfast was served. I was unfamiliar with the mechanism for turning this type of seat into a bed - the upholstery was so hard that I got virtually no sleep. I complained to Etihad and received an unsympathetic reply.

In-flight Wi-fi was available albiet only for 30 minutes after take-off and 30 minutes before landing. Considering the price you pay (US$30 and capped at just 100mB) I found this to be shameful.

Departure was a little delayed with around an hour sat on the tarmac going nowhere, however arrival was 20 minutes ahead of schedule the bags delivered immediately immigration was cleared, which never takes long in Singapore. The economy section was barely half full offering plenty of room.

To dispel criticism often levied at Etihad, the IFE was activated within 15 minutes of boarding and remained available, other than the obligatory adverts, almost to the arrival gate at Singapore.

For that change I was charged USD 209, which seems reasonable. On 5 November, my connecting flight to Manila, bought separately on Cebu Pacific, was cancelled due to heavy rains. I called Etihad and agreed with the Customer service that my ticket would be changed to “open”, as it was uncertain, when I would reach Manila.

In either case, the charge for changing my booking would be more than USD 2000, a few 100 USD less, if I would take the flight on 6 November. I decided to opt for departing on 5 November at 11 pm.

The fare rules of your originally purchased ticket were disclosed to you at the time of booking and send to you in a confirmation email.

The in-flight entertainment was adequate if nothing extraordinary and was enough to keep a nine year old and a 40 year old entertained for a total of 40 or so hours flying.

On these airlines, I have never, room permitting, been requested to pay USD$330 for my daughter and I to experience greater leg room in an exit row. In fact on the aforementioned ‘other’ airlines I have in fact been offered a seat with greater leg room (I am a tall man) or upon request, room permitting have been allocated a roomier seat.

Cabin crew were very pleasant, smiling, well-groomed and efficient. The meal service was without menus, but you could look up the meals for your flight online on Etihad website - it matched 100%. The metal cutlery made the whole experience classy. Meal service included complimentary wines, beers (Stella Artois and Budweiser), gin, whiskey, rum and vodka, plus non-alcoholic beverages. Cabin crew were generous with the drinks, mixing cocktails and giving out extra beer and other drinks to whoever asked them. I had the hindu meal, and it was very filling and healthy. IFE had few movies in Russian, but I guess that is to be expected, but the movie library in English was great and appealed to my taste. When I asked for a beer in the middle of the flight, the cabin crew member gave me two cans, saying ""why have one when you can have two"".

In October 2017 my wife and I flew with Etihad from TXL via AMS and AUH to PNQ. Originally the flight was to go directly from TXL via AUH to PNQ. However, there was a rebooking due to the Air Berlin bankruptcy, so that our flight went longer than planned. Even worse was the rebooking of the return flight, which did not go to Berlin as planned but to Düsseldorf from where we were to continue with the DB. For this we were given pick-up numbers, with which one would receive the train tickets directly at the automat. The outbound flight went as planned. On our return flight we arrived in DUS with a slight delay and hurried to the station. At the Automat it turned out, however, that the pick-up numbers were wrong. A DB employee checked on the computer and confirmed that there were no orders for the numbers provided. Since we had already reserved seats for the train, we decided to buy train tickets at our own expense to finally get home after the long flight. The train tickets were accordingly expensive (205 Euro for two persons) Only a few days later I contacted Etihad. Some e-mails and phone calls followed, until I was told to fill out a form with the bank details for reimbursement and the train tickets should be enclosed. I sent the documents by registered letter to Etihad in Berlin. Of course this was accepted (registered mail). However, there was never a reaction. Since I didn't buy my tickets directly from Etihad but from Flighttix.com, which I contacted first and which told me I had to contact Etihad because Etihad gave me the wrong pickup numbers, I contacted Flighttix.com again in April 2018. The contact persons were very friendly and promised me to clarify the matter with Etihad. E-mail correspondence followed between Flighttix, Etihad and myself, after which Etihad finally requested my bank details again for reimbursement. After I transmitted it, I thought it was finally done and I could sleep peacefully again. Unfortunately, there was never any refund. With my inquiries to Flighttix I got several times feedback that they will inquire with Etihad. My direct requests to the employee of Etihad (Commercial Planning Agent), with whom the correspondence took place, all went to nothing. E-mails were never answered and on the phone came only the automatic announcement that the contact person was currently not available. It's really sad how Etihad has behaved here. You are prepared to accept a much longer flight, even if you changed your reservation to a train journey, and in the end you would be left with additional costs and would be ignored by the airline after investing so much time and effort in clarifying the facts.

About 8-10 years ago Etihad was my favourite airline edging out Emirates, Singapore and Qatar. It has steadily deteriorated since that point and for the last few years has felt like a budget airline. It feels like everything is run for the benefit of the airline and the customer is just a cash cow. It is the only airline I now that regularly boards the passengers one hour and 15 minutes before scheduled departure and is almost always late to depart. My last few flights menat that we were boarded almost two hours before take off and that makes a long haul flight that much more uncomfortable.

I'm sure that the decline in quality of the food and the introduction of paid for snacks is no coincidence. The entertainment system is still very good but it is switched off unceremoniously about 30 minutes before landing. Some airlines have the entertainment available from the moment you sit down until the time to leave and when I enquired why this isnt possible with Etihad I was told it was for safety reasons. Maybe Etihad have different safety regulations to other Middle East carriers but I suspect that it is so they can collect in the headsets early - which summarises the apparent Etihad policy of prioritising airline convenience over customer comfort. At every stage it seems that costs have been cut and cut and cut and has turned what once was a premium airline which was a pleasure to fly with, into a hollowed out shell with stressed staff, disgusting food, poor service, scant regard for customer comfort and an unwavering eye on the bottom line.

"""leaves a lot to be desired""",1,2018-07-12,"Singapore to Athens via Abu Dhabi. The quality of this airline leaves a lot to be desired. Customer service is virtually non-existent. Even as a Gold member flying Business Class who had spent $25,000 on seats, I was treated by Etihad staff, with utter contempt and disdain. I flew with 6 family members, 2 of whom were infants. We spent more than $25,000 and 400,000 miles on our seats We were all in Business Class. I have been a gold member of the Etihad Guest rewards programme for 3 years. Despite repeated calls to the customer service line before we boarded, they did not manage to sit us together. Furthermore, the cabin crew did not help us to sit near each other, refusing to ask other passengers to move, even though those passengers were flying alone. The plane on the Singapore to Abu Dhabi leg has been replaced. Rather than the B787 which Etihad is quick to pretend flies on this route, it has been replaced by the aged A330, in which the business class offering is old and outdated. The plane is loud and most of all, extremely hot. When I complained about the offering, I was told that ""Etihad has the right to choose which planes it flies on its routes"". That is of course fine, but when you go to book the ticket online, the website clearly states you are paying for a seat on the Boeing 787. The bassinet seat I was offered for my daughter was above my head. She was able to wriggle out of it, and nearly fell out.

"""nothing but cost cutting""",3,2018-07-10,"Paris to Sydney via Abu Dhabi. Such a Disappointment. I have flown Etihad business in the past and what a fall from grace. As a frequent flyer who flies internationally at least 6 times a year and often in business, flying with Etihad is mediocre at best. 4 years ago it was fantastic and couldn't be faulted but now it is very average and nothing special. I travelled on points this time. The points for this Etihad flight are 30 - 60K more than their competitors which is a lot for their entry level business class points tickets. The crew on the CGD to ABU were average and did nothing to make you feel special. The plane was older and nothing special. The food was seriously no better than economy and in fact I have had better food in economy on other airlines in the past. The main meal I had I couldn't eat due to the meat being so full of gristle. There was so little food as well. On the flight from ABU to Sydney I asked what time breakfast was so I could set an alarm to wake up. I was told that Etihad no longer serve breakfast. The reason, 'people are on different time zones'. I said to the hostess that this is ridiculous and it was nothing but cost cutting. I also asked has management changed because something is clearly happening with this airline. I was told it is under new management and the staff are bearing the brunt of disgruntled customers. Maybe this explains why you don't see them much anymore. I must say the hostess I spoke with was really trying and stated I could I lodge a formal complaint with her. I felt that this would possibly be more effective and seeing by the amount of complaints on this site, maybe I was wrong. With regard to breakfast, you can order from the all day menu which includes pastries (2 small), cereal, egg white omelette, noodles or a steak sandwich. You cannot get a real egg omelette and breakfast is lack lustre. The main meal (beef) was so bad again it couldn't be eaten. It was as tough as a brick. I was informed this is because everything is reheated. Food is very poor. Apart from the food, the staff are not often seen like in the past. A few years ago, travelling Etihad business was a treat. Staff were attentitive & polite, food was wonderful and business was worth the money and/or points. Now it's get on, get off.

"""had friendlier crews on easyJet flights""",5,2018-07-08,"Etihad is the epitome of 'okay'. The first leg of our flight was on a tired looking A330, the cabin of which was looking decidedly dated and the IFE hardware not particularly responsive. The flight attendants were not overly friendly or helpful which was fine but they did not give the impression of working for a premium, full-service airline and I've probably had friendlier crews on easyJet flights. The best that can be said for the meal on this flight was once again, okay, nothing to complain about but nothing exciting either. Although, the use of steel cutlery is nice to see. The primary benefit of transferring at Abu Dhabi is its small size meaning that its relatively easy to get from one gate to another for connections but it was also easy to tell how cramped and crowded it would be to spend more than an hour here for a stopover as the airport certainly needs to expand to meet demand. AUH's most interesting feature is its security policy whereby hand luggage is scanned and passengers made to go through metal detectors which every, single, person seemed to be setting off, including myself, despite having nothing on me and not having had any issues at EDI. This then means being patted down in a small curtained area with an unfriendly and unspeaking member of security staff. Not only this, but once passengers arrive at their gate everyone on our outbound flight (though only certain people on our return, we were waved through without searching strangely) was having their carry-on hand searched which seemed slightly excessive giving all the security measures passengers have already been through up to that point. The next leg of the trip was on a relatively new A380 which had a modern cabin and great IFE system despite the seats being uncomfortable this felt like a much better flight. The crew were marginally more friendly than the EDI-AUH leg but still did not go out of their way to be courteous or helpful for passengers. The most disappointing thing on this flight was the food, not its quality but lack of quantity. There are no menus in economy which is fine but would have been a nice touch. We were served a dinner after takeoff of which there were only two options left so I chose the pasta which was delicious and came with a salad, roll and small pudding. But during this 13 hour flight we were only given one more 'snack' of popcorn and then a breakfast of cinnamon roll and custard before landing in Sydney, at half past five in the evening. This was not enough food for the length of flight. Our return flights were of similar quality the only issue being the check-in staff at Sydney Kingsford Smith airport. Passengers were queuing for check in as it was shown as being open for this flight on the overhead monitors however, the ground staff were all standing behind one desk chatting, laughing, hugging each other and not one desk was open yet. After standing for half an hour and a now huge queue having developed with several people going over to ask what was going on check-in finally opened. Once we eventually got to the bag-drop counter we were greeted by an unfriendly man who answered my request to print off our boarding passes with 'obviously'. Not a good impression.

Of course accidents can happen but despite letting them know my arm was actually burnt and I needed something for it I had to ask 3 times and wait over 20 minutes before I was brought a poultice. The flowing days my arm was red and a small section blistered. Not supplying requested vegan meals appears to be pretty standard as exactly the same thing happened on the same route almost exactly a year ago, and my colleague who flew the same route in reverse also did not have his vegan meals supplied in March of this year. A complaint to the customer service team was met with a pathetic response - 3000 air miles as compensation. But my flights were booked with Virgin Australia where my air miles are based, and they were not transferable to this program. And what kind of totally inadequate compensation is 3000 air miles to me anyway? As a Gold Velocity member I expect better of both Virgin (whose response was also inadequate) and Etihad.

After many back and forth emails and calls to Etihad, the outcome was that I was to blame, and that I made up the story to try and gain extra miles. They robbed me of 45000 hard earned miles and refuse to acknowledge any fault from their system or at the very least come up with a resolution or compromise. And I am apparently a loyal Gold customer and also a government employee, where we are given privilege treatment. I can only imagine how a ""regular"" customer would have been treated. This is only one of many issues I have faced as their services decline along with their money hungry cost cutting approach to virtually all aspects of their business. It is a real shame.

At no point was any rest place or accomodation advised or given and we had to argue in getting food vouchers rather than being offered them. We managed to see through the next 7 hours only to be confronted with more difficulty. We queued for our connecting flight only to be told we need to check in our hand carry. We insisted we were carrying medicine which we needed to keep, at which point the attendant shouted and threatened to deboard us from the plane if we didn't comply.

The other interesting thing was the first officer announced that we are traveling along the “Arabian Gulf”, I thought it was called “Persian Gulf”, I checked my google map again and I am certain it is Persian Gulf, it is like saying welcome to Qatar or Saudi once we land in Abu Dhabi. This was pretty stupid to me as I suppose the airlines must be accurate with their announcements. The last thing is Abu Dhabi Airport itself, I know it isn’t much to do with the airline or flight quality, but when you travel with Etihad you have to go past the airport and that airport is terrible, small and cramped with people with super dirty toilets.

Several times their customer service confirmed to accept our ticket via email on 20.08 and hotline on 07.11 that we will able to check in. They booked us into their system (however only the return flight instead of both flights). After we called customer service on 07.11 again, Etihad employee sent us a ticket (both ways), and confirmed again that with this ticket we will be able to check into our flight. Since on 10.11. one flight was still not visible on Etihad website, we called the hotline again. We were then informed that they won't accept our ticket. We are left confused if Etihad will honor their previous promises. Also we are very unhappy with this behavior. If they make promises they should keep them. If they don't intent to keep promises then better don't make any promise at all. Now we have buy new tickets shortly before we fly, which are very expensive now, comparing to 3 months ago.

"""No responses yet after 3 weeks""",1,2017-11-12,"✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to Belgrade via Abu Dhabi. This is not review about the flight itself but the customer service and the user experience. The problem for me started when I arrived at the airport and they noticed that my wife switched my name and surname when registering the ticket. They notified me that the ticket is invalid and I cannot use it at all. I had to buy a new ticket which cost me 2x more than the one I already had. Since the problem was that only name and surname were switched, this is something that is totally unacceptable to me. When I arrived at Bangkok I tried to get in touch with the airline to learn if I can be at least partly refunded for the ticket that I was not able to use. On the web they say to contact them over Facebook page so I did. The response on the messenger took a few hours but they said to send the question over email. So I did. No responses after 5 days. I found online also the email address to where I wrote the same question. No responses yet after 3 weeks except the autoreply that they will look into my request. After not getting any response I tried also calling them. Their phone service is terrible. You are guided through multiple level of selections such as ""for english press 1"", ""if you bought your ticket online press 1"". At the deepest level you always reach a stage where they say they explain that you should find you answer somewhere else and that the call will now end. Horrible service, especially since these are all international calls. At just one of these deepest levels I was able to finally get a person to whom I was able to speak. They explained to me that the ticket cannot be refunded and that I can even be happy that they don't charge me additional money for not showing up. The last straw for my dissatisfaction with the airline was the checking in to return back home. I tried to check in online one day before and all seats were already marked as non-available. I assumed I simply need to choose the seat when I check in at the counter. I was one of the first people at the counter 4 hours before the flight. The person who checked me in was a trainee without any experience. She said that there are no seats available anymore next to the window on the two connected flights that I had with the airline.

On the next counter to us a couple were having similar issues. We tried our best though there was no other airline staff around and the check in staff are not employed by Etihad so there was nothing they could do really. We paid up and then got to the boarding to find out the flight was delayed an hour, then it was delayed even longer which meant we would miss our connecting flight. It wasn't all bad as we were put up in an excellent hotel with great food and the plus for me was that I was able to now watch the McGregor vs Mayweather fight. The other upside is that we chatted with the other couple who had isses in the next isle to us and they informed us about the regulations. If a passenger flying out of the UK is more than 6 hours delayed they are entitled to 600euro / person. After lots of emails and proof of our flights we eventually got our 600/each from Etihad.

Because Etihad code share with Air Berlin, with Air Berlin going into liquidation, our return bookings were cancelled and changed around 4 times. I was supposed to be flying out of Berlin, but they thought it would be easy to just fly out of Dusseldorf or Munich - both 5 hour train trips or maybe to get across to Serbia and fly from there. The final solution offered was to fly from Berlin with Alitalia to Rome, hang around in the airport for 8 hours and then join up to Abu Dhabi and fly back to Melbourne - this equated to a very long journey. On checking in with Alitalia, they decided that my 15kgs of extra luggage would be charged at Euro 344 for the journey. Note that I had tried to put in the excess baggage through the Etihad website, but it does not allow you to do this - so you are zapped at the airport with a large charge that you are then not in a position to find options for. The travel documentation indicates that the cost for an extra bag is US$ 185.00, however this is not the case. I shipped a 30kg suitcase door to door from Germany for Euro 280 so you can see how bad this charge is. On the flight, once again no special meal so the crew had to find bits of fruit for me to eat - they blame this on Flight Centre and Flight Centre say the meal request was definitely in the system - who is lying? Both totally incompetent. A totally dreadful experience and will never fly with them or recommend them again.

"""choose a different airline next time""",3,2017-10-28,"✅ Verified Review |  Jakarta to Berlin via Abu Dhabi and Belgrade, I was looking forward to enjoy a pleasant flight. The first flight from Jakarta to Abu Dhabi was an Etihad operated flight, the last two flights were Air Serbia operated flights. For those, who do not know Air Serbia: Etihad owns 49% of that airline and manages it. The first flight was a night flight, departing 0:10 am. My seat was not reclining as it should. It was going back to normal position, when I leaned forward a little. The flight attendant confirmed that the seat has a defect, and told me, she would try to find a solution. Well, nothing happened, not even a feedback. After 23 hours of travelling with Etihad (including waiting times at the airports), I was about to start my final flight to Berlin at Belgrade on time. While waiting in the airplane I fell asleep, just to wake up 20 min. after regular departure time, because of the pilot's announcement: All passengers would need to leave the airplane due to a technical error. Then, we needed to wait, without knowing, what would happen next. This took around 3 hours. The airline provided water and apple juice for free but no information. Then, the flight was cancelled. The ground staff told us, that we would get new tickets immediately and after that we would stay in a hotel to catch our new flight connection on the next day. What they did not tell us: Everybody would need to wait until all new tickets are issued. No option to buy food is available at that part of the airport. After that, we would be transfered directly to the hotel. This happened another 2 hours later. While waiting for the new tickets to be issued and in the bus for the other passengers whose tickets have not been issued yet, no food was provided. So 5.30 hours after the regular departure time, I was checking in at the hotel. It was 11.40 pm local time and they were about to pick me up at 4 am the next day, so that I could catch my flight in the morning at 6.35 am. At the hotel we were finally provided a food bag, with a sandwich in it, an apple, drinkable yoghurt and chocolate mousse...The hotel kitchen was closed already...too late. The spa was also closed by the way. Well, I did not get any sleep that night, because I was so afraid of missing my next flight, because I was super tired.

I flew Eithad to the US twice before from the UAE in first and raved about the food, service and comfort on its 380. So roll on three years forward and a business class booking where I spent good money to upgrade to first from Munich to Abu Dhabi​ where​ the experience could not have been more different and disappointing. The outbound flight EY04 Boeing 777-300 seat was the first shock since clearly these seats had seen a better day and for the most part unless fully extended was uncomfortable. The leather padding kept moving around and thus prone to slide in the sitting position. Unlike the two prior trips where the first class seating was big enough to seat two people these seats were not. The aircraft seemed old and worn unlike the new 777’s which are great to fly. The food options were greatly diminished from prior Etihad flights and I was a bit shocked to see just how uninteresting the menu was. I ordered food but then decided to cancel since sleep was needed. I did not feel like I missed anything and other reviewers confirmed it. I would have liked something to munch on even though the plane had less than an hour before landing but the answer was no. Really not even a breakfast roll? I had to keep asking for coffee refills but at least I got that. Very different from my prior Etihad flights​ where service was outstanding​.​ ​ The movie selection was mediocre and not worth turning on to watch the films available. The other on board surprise was the FC toiletries that were handed out. An oversized bag with tiny samples of lotion or toothpaste. Etihad no longer carries the Bergamonte brand it did ​previously​ and clearly my bag was exactly the same as business. Etihad use to be much more generous in its offering both size and quality of products. Once I passed immigration I decided to stop into the arrivals lounge for a bite to eat since I missed my meal and the food offerings there were a joke. Some tiny sandwiches tea, juice or coffee. So I passed and decided to wait until I reach my hotel. Etihad has also cheapened its car service by insisting you buy a full fare ticket before you have access to the service. At first their worthless customer service said no but I tried requesting again online and got a confirmation of service so I was able to use it. The supervisor in the line of cars awaiting Etihad passengers had to argue with four of the drivers before one would agree to take me as I was not that far from the airport. I was shocked to watch them go back and forth. The value if I had booked a car service they recommended for the discounted FC passengers from AUH to ​the Intercontinental​ $35. Now Etihad has become so cost cutting that on a $5500 ticket they didn’t want to cover the $35 cost or even pay for the $20 taxi ride to my hotel? So average service, mediocre food, worn out first class seating, unnecessary rules for first class car service; just adds up to a second class airline in all major categories when looking at their competition.

The entertainment on offer is also limited compared to other airlines. I’ve been with Qantas and Emirates who have a much wider variety of films and tv shows to watch than Etihad do. What also annoyed me is that on the Paris to Brisbane leg they locked the tinting on the windows so it was really dark on the aircraft despite being daytime. I was looking forward to seeing the beautiful Western Australian coastline from my seat but was prevented from doing this by the flight crew. I was unable to edit the window settings as they had been locked out. There does seem to be an element of cost cutting at play which has resulted in poor service.

Flight got cancelled and booked for another flight 9 hours later: aircraft issue - understandable. I was offered hotel and rides back and forth upon my arrival at the airport - still understandable. I did not take this offer because I wanted to spend more time with my family. Due to this flight delay, my whole itinerary changed: SGN-AUH-IAD-JFK. There was another flight straight from AUH-JFK but regretfully missed by few min, but they weren't going to let me on that plane anyway - I paid for a one stop flight. I was boarding for flight from AUH and heard an Etihad staff yelling at a passenger in a line to move away? The passenger looked so dumbfounded. Extremely unprofessional behavior. Arrived and found out flight was cancelled from IAD to JFK. They did not offer me hotel (did offer a discounted rate), nor another method of ride to JFK that night. Had a meeting at work the next morning, how inconveniently arrived just a night before the meeting due to delays and cancellations. Therefore, I decided to take a train, but I had to wait for my luggage at an office, and the lady there, who was associated with JetBlue, got me on a free shuttle from IAD to JFK (Which I truly appreciated). Overall, my flight was extended by 12 hours, arrived 15+ hours later than expected, extra costs I spent at the airport. After this incidence, I requested for a refund of my ticket or at least get compensated for the cancelled flight that I never took and for the major changes (one stop flight -> two stops). They did offer me some compensation after 2 months, and I received 15,000 miles on Etihad. I can't even go anywhere with 15,000 miles. I argued that I deserve more, but they reviewed and concluded that was enough for me, they said. I received the miles just because I might be able to transfer these miles to another airlines that I take, if not, it's just going to rot there. I will never be taking Etihad again, and will strongly recommend against it.

"""you could feel the cost-cutting""",2,2017-10-03,"✅ Verified Review |  Ho Chi Minh to Frankfurt return via Abu Dhabi. Etihad Airways losing its stars and reputation. After a disappointing outbound experience I hoped for the better this time. But check-in in Frankfurt was very bad, again: Staff seemed to be demotivated, overworked and arrogant. Our request to add an extra bag within our maximum weight allowance was rejected and ground staff even started to argue with us that the information on this matter given to us by Etihad before in writing was wrong and that we were lying to them. The Etihad-lounge in Frankfurt, before one of the best lounges in the world, was shut down. Instead we have been offered Lufthansa Senator-lounge, which is a business-class lounge only. So no first class lounge access even for a fully paid first class flight and instead of a steak grilled to order or other individually cooked items only turkey sausages were our hot dinner-option in Frankfurt, since we wanted to sleep on the short night flight to Abu Dhabi. The next bad surprise was that Etihad – in order to cut costs – does not even cater on board any local newspaper or magazine from its departure-countries any more. Only English and Arabic language papers from Abu Dhabi were available – which were outdated. Staff on board was friendly and professional, and we had a good sleep on board. Upon arrival in Abu Dhabi, priority delivery-service was not working and we had to wait for about 45 minutes for our luggage. Etihad also cancelled it’s free chauffeur service. The counter after arrival was closed and we have been sent by a cheap 8-seater-taxi to our hotel rather than a limousine. Check-in at Etihad’s 1st Class counter in Abu Dhabi was again a disaster: bossy staff that neither greeted us nor helped re-packing our baggage because one piece they said was overweight, even though we checked in the same piece with Etihad in FRA 2 days before with no problem. My request for helping us with some Scotch-tape to re-seal the 2 boxes we had to open for re-packing was ignored, the check-in lady did not even leave her chair to look for it, and instead we were requested to seal them for a hefty fee by an outside supplier. Because of the request of re-packing without proper packing materials some valuable crystal items arrived broken. Communication was very unfriendly, too: instead of asking my wife for her passport, the check-in agent was just waving my passport at us and asked us: ‘who flies’? The agent also checked not our seat-requests and we first did not get our assigned seats. Our flight was leaving from T1, yet no information at check-in that Etihad only has one first class lounge in T3 - where we checked in. So we walked more than 15 minutes through the hectic Abu Dhabi airport from T3 to T1 and back to T3. At least the service on board was spotless, even though you could feel the cost-cutting when it came to the food and beverage-selections. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the airport manager, who helped us through passport control. In conclusion, savings in catering and staff, resulting in overworked and arrogant check-in agents, stop of chauffeur-services and denied access to a 1st class lounge are making even 1st-class flying with Etihad a pain. The only good thing is that the staff on board still remains friendly and professional, as before.

Then to add insult to injury asked me to pay £160.0 as it was the airline fee for additional bag.

When I tried to transfer stuff in checked in hand bad it became 24.0kg and they would not even allow for that.

Not anymore. Since Etihad is in financial turmoil and cost-cutting became its No. 1 priority, lounges are closed, service turned sour and savings on dining and wining even in Etihad’s First Class are the new, disappointing standard. Because of staff-reductions, we had to wait 15 minutes at check-in at SGN-airport. Reason: staff was checking in Business-Class guests at Etihad’s First-Class counter. Formerly an absolute no-no. Boarding was chaotic, as well: no priority boarding and we had to queue with all other 200+ passengers. The welcome on board was warm, yet the standard of service is dropping down: instead the traditional collection of 3 different snacks only nuts were served and even though it was only 3 passengers in First, my wife and me could not get the requested mixed vegetables, because they ‘run out of it’ already. The amenity-kit, formerly a traditionally designed and waved pouch of high quality was replaced by a cheap plastic version and mine was used already (pouch with lip-balm, etc. missing). The interior of the aircraft, an old A340 was outworn and some of the buttons for the remote of the Personal Entertainment system and the seat were not working properly any more. Staff, however, was friendly and caring. On the stopover I also visited the Etihad 1st Class lounge in Abu Dhabi, which is excellent. But waiting times in the restaurant increased significantly and waiting more than 2 hours for a morning-shave is unacceptable. Our continuing flight to Frankfurt was on a remote gate. Yet, 35 minutes before boarding no bus for 1st and business-class passengers was available. Had to wait with all other passengers for more than 20 minutes. No seat available, thus standing. Entering the aircraft by stairs was hectic, people were squeezing each other, so we decided to board last. Pre-flight service was hectic because the bus arrived just 5 minutes before departure but at least the inflight-service was flawless. Upon arrival no arrival service and our luggage was delivered late, even though we had priority and first-class stickers on them. I always have been a fan of Etihad and enjoyed its perfect lounges, services and friendly staff. But cost-cutting effects even Etihad’s most loyal (Platinum-member) and revenue-contributing (flying 1st-class) customers to such a degree, that the great flight-experience, I am paying for, hardly exists any more.

I waited for them to finish there said conversation before I handed my passport. After a few security questions I was checked in and directed to the fast check security , I did so and was greeted by the most welcoming man with a warm smile (a Heathrow staff member) who checked my boarding pass and wished me a safe flight. After browsing the duty free shops I made my way to gate 10 where the Etihad Airways lounge is located. On entertaining the lounge I met two lovely welcome hosts who asked if my luggage and suit bag would like to be stored. She then offered me the WIFI slip. The first impression of the lounge was dark and small. I passed about 6 staff who were standing there like zombies no more then a smile. I had a walk around before I sat in the ala carte section where I thought I would have a nice lunch. There were pre set menus on the table so I had a look and went for the salmon salad of which I ordered after attracting the attention of one of the staff. I asked for a glass of Chardonnay and some sparkling water and was told I had to help my self from the buffet area. I found that very strange considering I was sat in the restaurant area expecting restaurant service? The salad arrived in super quick time (with no salad only x2 baby potatoes cut into 4 pieces, green beans, 2 cherry tomatoes also cut into 4 pieces and a splash of balsamic dressing) -  the salmon was very moist clearly being sat in a steamer until an order came in. After my salad-less salad I fancied a coffee so decided I leave the lounge and head to Costa Coffee as the Etihad coffee machine had seen better days. Boarding was called and like you'd expect everyone marched up to the gate in one go only to be turned away as there zones were not yet called. A warm welcome from the crew as I boarded and found my seat 16A. Business seats are incredible and should be rolled out on all Etihads long haul business class. The flight was fantastic, service standards won back from that I had in the lounge. Only downside they have taken the wash bags away and only offer these on night flights! Explained by the crew member with a nervous smile. Items like toothbrush, socks were available but you had to ask. Cutting back things in the premium cabins never goes down well with crew or the paying passengers who expect it.

"""will not recommend this airline""",2,2017-09-26,"✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to Tehran via Abu Dhabi. My daughter and myself had a return flight (Economy class) from LAX to IKA. The flight was scheduled for 4:55pm. We arrived at the airport around 2:15pm and waited in the line for the checking-in process. After around 50 minutes, it was our turn. When the lady with light brown and skirt weighed our 4 luggage pieces, each had between 2-3Kg overweight which was a bit higher than what we had found in home weighing them. In fact, by seeing the overweight of the first one, she did not want to weigh the rest of them which we insisted to see if the total was lower than the maximum allowed weight when she finally agreed. When she saw the overweight, she asked us either to pay the overweight fee or reduce the weight somewhere else and then go to the end of the line and said that it was the policy. This was unfair to us which had waited in the line for about 50 minutes which was long and also the check-in line had not been shorten by then anyways.  Also, nobody had told us about the policy and asked us to check the weights before it becomes our turn for check-in. We reduce the weight to below 46 Kg for each of us. Then, I complained to the lady who said that she was the supervisor and finally, as an exception of the policy, she directed us to a different line than the normal one which took us the same time as that of the original line. The check-in finished around 4:00pm (close to two hours for the check-in process) and we had to go to the passport control and security check with the 55 minutes left for us. This took longer than usual. Finally, we got to the gate five minutes to departure gate when luckily there was about 30 minutes delay of departure time which we did not know. Now, that you very strict on the maximum allowed weight, you should let your passengers know ahead of time about this and ask/direct them to weight their luggage pieces in the airport with scales that are in the counter before staying in the queue.

It cuts costs by, for example, in Dublin, sharing the budget terminal with Ryanair.

We flew MRS to AUH via Paris CDG, arriving in AUH at 7.30pm, and in spite of a 2 hours transfer lag our 5 pieces of luggage did not make it to Abu Dhabi, like the luggage of another 20 people, even if our luggage were appearing as loaded in Etihad system. After being asked to wait for an hour or so, as they were confident they would locate the luggage in AUH Airport, we were finally asked to file a report as the luggage were definitely somewhere in Paris CDG Airport. Finally left the airport after 2 hours and a half of confusion and chaos as the baggage claim department is undersized, especially since this was a very busy week end. We had high hopes that our luggage would arrive on the next morning as an Etihad flight arrives daily as well at 6.40am from Paris, but unfortunately we saw in the baggage tracking website that they were planned to arrive only on the 7.30pm flight. So 24 hours after our original flight we rang Etihad who informed us that someone would get in touch this same evening to arrange the delivery of our 5 bags. The next morning, as we had not heard anything from Etihad, I rang the luggage service a dozen of times, before getting an answer, to learn that they finally only had 4 of our 5 bags, in spite of what was told us the night before. After insisting, and shouting a bit, they finally went to look for the 5th bag and rang me back to tell me it was finally found and that we could come and pick our 5 bags. Delivery was not possible due apparently to some new requirements of customs who want people there in case a bag needs to be opened. At 6pm, so nearly 48 hours after our original flight, we reached at the airport to collect our bags and there they tell us they have only 4 bags out of the 5. And the cherry on the cake, is that the missing bag is not the same as the one that was thought missing in the morning! So they had found all 5 and lost one again. After another bit of shouting and a couple of hours, we were promised by the supervisor that they would find the bag and bring it home the same night. Drove back home with the 4 bags, and at 9pm received a call from a guy on his way to deliver the 5th bag, which finally reached us at 10pm.

Had our flight left on time we would have had two hours to catch our connecting flight to Male. This didn't happen and our flight left London roughly two hours later than it should have done which put our connecting flight at risk. That said we had made up some time and landed at 8am with our connecting flight was at 8:40am. The warning signs appeared on the flight when the crew were evasive when asked for advice, simply telling us to talk to the Etihad 'transit staff'. After we rushed off the plane we were apprehended by the transit staff who made us sit in a waiting area for ten minutes without offering an explanation. We gave up on this and ran to our gate, arriving at 8:25 only to be told we needed to have been there five minutes prior to this point in order to Board (20 minute limit is imposed). We were carrying exhausted young children and at this point my wife burst into tears. We were then shuttled to another transit area, on foot which took ~30 minutes, half dragging/carrying our poor kids. The line at this location was about an hour and a half long with one staff member dealing with ~60 similar issues by themselves. If you ever need to see how a company treats its most vulnerable, captive passengers this place gave it all away. Most of the women were in tears. At this point our children were close to breaking point but we were fortunate to find a kind Etihad employee walking by who took us to alternative transit area. There we were told we had been re-booked on a 00:55 flight and we would be put up in a £40 a night hotel 37km away. The staff in the transit area were aggressive and refused to discuss the logistics of how we were supposed to get two small children, without buggies/strollers, to this destination. Most importantly they refused to discuss why we would have to wait 15 hours when the airline could not have waited five minutes for us to board. Eventually we were able to relocate to a closer hotel but I write this 7 hours later and we are yet to receive a call telling us where our luggage is. We critically need this because our 6mo old son needs milk, nappies and a change of clothes. Taking him outside in 45c heat to try and find the above is not really acceptable. My final gripe, and I appreciate this is a high quality problem, is that we have now missed a night in a hotel we spent a year planning and saving up to visit. Etihad refuse to discuss compensation and their website doesn't offer any advice. I also believe we are entitled to EU flight delay compensation but they're attempting to use the loophole that since we were changing flights outside of the EU this doesn't hold!

I specifically chose to go the longer route via Melbourne so that I could get to Sydney on Tuesday night as I had a day full of meetings on Wednesday.

Unfortunately the flight did not depart at 5pm due to Etihad deciding to wait for passengers and eventually departed over an hour later at about 6.15pm. We were due to arrive in Abu Dhabi at 8.40pm and my connecting flight to Melbourne was at 10.10pm. I anxiously hoped we would pick up speed and get there on time but we arrived at about 9.30pm instead. I desperately needed to make my connecting flight so I checked the gate number on the screen before we arrived and it was gate 61 which was in Terminal 3 and we were arriving in terminal 1. As soon we disembarked I ran as fast as I could to gate 61 and made it to the gate and through security while others were still boarding. As I was about to get on the flight the Etihad personnel said that I was rebooked and could not board the flight. I explained that I had run from my previous flight and there was still 25 minutes till the schedule departure and that I should be allowed to get on this flight. While we were debating several other people who came after me were allowed on the flight which I thought was just wrong. They eventually sent me to the transfer desk who arranged a hotel and meal voucher for me. I was expected to sleep in my already sweaty clothes and come back in the same clothes with no compensation or allowance for some temporary clothes. I asked them to allocate me the same exit row window seat that I had on my original flight and they were not willing to do that. They did not even arrange for me to have my special meal on my rebooked flight. I eventually ended up at the hotel which required me to pass immigration and leave the airport and then after about a 20 minute drive get to a hotel. There is a Transit hotel in the airport which would not require you to leave the transit area or the airport and clearly to save money they booked me into a Holiday Inn outside of the airport. I then about the meal voucher and it was limited to 50AED. That amount would only pay for a sandwich but not even a soft drink which is again ridiculously cheap.

The food was good, I had mac and cheese although I did not like the bean and peas vegetable mix and would have preferred a salad. For entertainment there was a good variety of Hollywood, European, Indian, and some Asian cinema as well as TV shows. I would quite like to see more Asian movies as there were only around three.

To add insult to injury, the seat area had a pungent odor. Since this was a family trip with a connecting flight and nobody could offer me a workable solution, I had to have the seat manually adjusted to a flat recline and endure a 9-hour flight without lights or power. To cap it off, the stewardess directed me to go to the toilet at the back end of business class when I went to the business class toilet near the cockpit, as if I was bothering them. To make up for my discomfort, I was handed a letter saying that they have given me free miles equivalent to a polo shirt from their souvenir store. As a frequent flyer, I found this an unjust compensation for the level of distress I experienced on such a long flight, so I decided to return the letter and reject the offer. I then proceeded to email a formal complaint to their customer service only to receive the same proposal despite my objections the first time. I decided to raise my concern to their CEO and was surprised and disappointed to get the same reply from a customer service agent who continued to insist on their offer.

They were slow with my requests and at one point, forgot my request for tea, which after 30 minutes of waiting I had to get up and get my own tea. The airplane was nice and the seats were quite comfortable but the blankets and pillows were mediocre. The blankets were quite thin and flimsy, where I had to have two to feel warm. The meals were served quite often though but they were quite bland and I was generally not impressed with the taste or variety of the meals. While the above experience was not great, what made it worse was my experience with the customer service staff regarding my luggage and I would like to warn people the policies regarding checked-in luggage. I had checked in my luggage (after paying an excess baggage fee of £97.50 for being over the limit, which I accepted) and had expected my luggage to arrive at my destination in the same condition. However, when I received the luggage the handle did not come out anymore and was clearly damaged during the transfer from London to Perth. When I approached the ground staff, they advised me to contact their online customer service regarding the matter but there was nothing they could do at that point. I did contact their Baggage Claim customer service department and received a generic response telling me that their policies state 'they are not responsible for damage to luggage due to wear and tear or damage to handles and wheels' so they asked for my 'kind understanding' to accept that policy but they would gladly write a note to my travel insurer so I could claim through them. I was not pleased with this response because I would be out of pocket again to claim through my insurer and asked to be referred to someone that would be able to deal with me as a person and not reiterate their policies. The response I received was quite antagonising and frustrating, they said they couldn't do anything because 'they couldn't confirm the cause of the alleged damage' and they referred me to another department which after 3 days still have not responded to my query. This ordeal has been over a week and I have been pushed around to different departments and ignored and left with no satisfactory response to my situation. I'm quite disappointed with Etihad's response (or lack of) since other airlines would have quickly resolved this issue without making the customer go around in circles. Etihad has a good reputation but be warned that they do not treat their customers with respect and listen to their situation when things go wrong. They are generally quite unhelpful and will provide generic responses or pull policies on you. For such a big company, I expected some flexibility especially if an irate customer has approached them several times to give them the opportunity to rectify the situation.

Firstly we booked tickets and due to circumstances we wanted to change the name on one of the tickets. Even though myself and my husband paid for these tickets apparently we don't own them, they belong to the person whose name is on the ticket. So now a person who didn't fly or pay for the ticket no owns a free ticket to use for themselves!? No money can ever be returned. We had an accident at the airport which meant that we couldn't fly on our original flight. And we were assured by Etihad Airways management that we would be put on the next possible flight with minimal costs to us. £20-30 max, however the truth is it cost us an additional £1900! Why when the accident which required my 2yr old to be rushed to hospital from the departure lounge! Assurances and results seem to be very different from management at the ground to the sellers on the phone at the head office. On the new flights it seemed completely unorganised and irresponsible that Etihad Airways thought it was perfectly fine for my 2yr old daughter to be sat on her own without myself or my mother who was attending the flight just to help with the children. The ground staff in Manchester worked tirelessly making sure that this was corrected before we boarded. However it seems that Abu Dhabi staff are less interested and treated me with disrespect and disgust. I stood at the gate for over an hour trying to sort out the mistake they had made to be told by their manager that I can either board the flight and have my 2 yr old sat alone or I can stay in Abu Dhabi, my choice. I was also traveling with my 1 yr old son who I bought a seat for as the flight was too long for him to not have his own space. Now I as told that passengers with infants get priority seating i.e. The space and the options of bassinets for baby's which was one of the reasons for booking with Etihad. However I was not given this either other parents were but I wasn't. I boarded the flight to be told on board that my daughter could sit alone and my mother alone elsewhere on the flight and myself to sit with my son on my lap. Without the seat I had paid for him! And this to the staff was completely acceptable and because I was getting increasingly distressed at the prospect of my 1 yr old without his seat or a bassinet and my 2 yr old sat alone for a 14hr flight, they dealt with it by stating my son doesn't have his own seat and that if I didn't calm down I would be escorted off the flight! The air staff took my 4 boarding passes from me and never returned them. An Australian member of ground staff, who treated me very disrespectfully told me as I had no proof of my 4 boarding passes lost by the staff I had no right to the additional seat for my son. If it wasn't for a couple giving up their seats for me and my children I don't think I would have ever taken that flight. We took off with my son without his seat and my daughter sat beside me and with me in an attempt to try and hold down a 1yr old and 2 yr old myself. All in all my family and I paid up to £6k for these flights which I have to say was possibly the worst 32 hours of my life because Etihad Airways have no respect or helpful approach to traveling families in Abu Dhabi. They were awful to deal with and deny that they made mistakes like sitting a 2 yr old on her own! Or giving me a seat which I paid for.

The pre-clearance in Abu Dhabi is Etihad's main selling point however, it's actually a huge pain and causes lots of passengers to miss their connecting flights. Etihad automatically rebooked me on a later flight to LAX, then LAX to SFO with American Airlines, adding 10 hours to my original trip. All they did was take my boarding pass to SFO and give me the new boarding passes to SFO via LAX without any explanation. No lounge access or hotel was offered to me. No one was able to tell me if my luggage would follow me, which was really frustrating. Got a middle seat for the Abu Dhabi-Los Angeles which lasted 17 hours. Also, cherry on the cake, the LAX-SFO was cancelled due to ""air traffic"" and no one told me, so I ended up flying United back home, arriving 13 hours later than originally planned. Finally, my luggage did follow me - surprisingly after so many obstacles. Anyway, easily the worst trip I've ever had.

Most of the passengers around us would also like another option, other than the lamb, the only one available. The crew politely told us that due to the profile of the passengers, the menu had been constructed as having lamb as the preferred option. I believe that in flight to Brazil, the menu profile should be improved. Following meals included a frozen chicken sandwich, a pack of sliced apples and a snack of sweet popcorn. Light dinner at the end of the flight had one option only: chicken with penne. There were no small snacks available during a 15 hours flight.

We have just returned from a week in Abu Dhabi. This is the first (and last time) we have used this airline. Our six year old son was with us as this was a family holiday.  Etihad oversold the flight, so when we arrived 2.5 hours before take-off to find we only had 3 of the 4 seats we had paid for we were a little unhappy. We had pre-reserved seats but as they had also changed the aircraft this reservation didn't stand. The manner in which they dealt with it was appalling. They have a designated ""Rebooking Desk"" adjacent to the check in at Abu Dhabi which may suggest they do this a lot? Their response (including their senior supervisor) was ""sorry there aren't enough seats"". I’ve never posted a poor review before. In fact I've just left the Westin Abu Dhabi a 5 star review as they were superb. Etihad unfortunately are at the other end of the scale. They are so much smaller than Emirates (who we've flown with 40+ times) so don't have many flights operating. They said ""we are confident we can get you on the 2.30am flight"". Not ideal to hang around the airport for 14 hours then fly all night with a 6 year old. No apology was made. They made no suggestion on how they could resolve the issue or help it was very simply just tough luck. I have experienced overbooking in the US when travelling with work. Quality airlines hold the check in process then ask passengers if they are willing to travel on a later flight or codeshare. Offering upgrades and compensation. Etihad don’t even offer an apology. They won't compensate you (other than a voucher that can only be redeemed with Etihad). If accommodation is needed (as they operate so few flights) they select where you stay - and there are onsite airport hotels which I suspect aren't great so be warned. OK - then on board. The flights were also both awful. Outbound from London they decided to wait 3 hours before serving dinner (we took off at 20.45)! This meant they woke 1/2 of the plane up as they served it at midnight (3am Abu Dhabi time). They then let everyone go back to steep, then 1.5 hours later turned the lights? This was still 2 hours before landing. None of our party of 4 ate the food. It was dreadful. The inflight entertainment is very, very poor compared with leading airlines. There are limited films and many are very old. The children's selection is poor too. I'm unsure why the inflight entertainment doesn't start until 1/2 hour after take-off (once you start cruising) and they turn it off before starting the descent. The two times when you really need something to focus on are take-off & landing. Again other airlines allow this to run for the entire time you are seated. Why can't Etihad? For some reason they have opted to use wider than normal trolleys. The consequence is that if you have an aisle seat in economy you are likely to get hit by the trolley quite often. As they barely fit down the aisle. I was hit 3 times on the return flight. Never did the steward say sorry. This seems to be Etihads policy. As we taxi’d across to the stand at LHR I got a quote for a taxi from Dubai to Abu Dhabi. It’s circa 1 hour drive at £100. Next time we go to Abu Dhabi we will fly into Dubai and get a taxis.

This review is not so much about the flight but more about the rudeness and lack of service. As a business class flyer you pay a premium for the little things such as seats, chauffeur pickup and service. Our experience so far has been far from what we thought Etihad would deliver. In Singapore the allocated pickup time for the chauffeur was not suitable so we spent time calling and explaining this and requesting another time. We understood that this had been done and waited the following day for the car, which never arrived as it was not changed as per the conversation we had, so we had to make our own way to the airport. The flight from Singapore to Abu Dhabi was fine but the staff were not friendly. The staff and food from Abu Dhabi to Rome was much better and pleasant. In Venice, we called Etihad to book the chauffeur service and were told it by their staff to call Alitalia as it was a Alitalia flight even though we booked and paid through Etihad, it is an EY flight number, plane and ticket. The care factor of the staff member was zero. We then had to call Alitalia. After four separate conversations and Alitalia confirming the water taxi on a return phone call, we have now been advised by the external company that we have a car booked. We explained it is Venice and we need a water taxi and that this was confirmed by Alitalia staff to be told by the external chauffeur company that we have to pay our own way to a designated meeting place on land to take a car. Numerous emails later and lots of time later, we are now left with no chauffeur service and each company blaming each other. If this is the business class service you get with Etihad then is it any wonder people choose to fly their competitors. We are Platinum and Platinum Plus flyers and travel constantly and wanted to experience Etihad. But we have been so disappointed in Etihad's service and the extra costs we have incurred.

Front-facing seats are also set close together, so if you're travelling alone, choose either a single seat or a back-facing seat to avoid sitting too close to a stranger. Seats slid down to a very comfortable bed - some business class seats slide into a somewhat claustrophobic space for your feet, but I didn't feel it with the Business Class Studio. Pillow and comforter were great and I had a good sleep on a 6+ hour flight. Food service was prompt and friendly, attention to detail by the steward/stewardess was very good. Food itself was excellent - had a gnocchi dish that could have been served right out of an Italian restaurant kitchen. The magic kind of ends when you land at Abu Dhabi airport and realise that you are not parked at a gate, and you actually have to go down the portable steps into a bus that drives you for another 15 minutes before pulling up at the terminal. Although we did get a 'business class bus' (complete with leather seats) for one of the legs, it's not a great experience after being on the 787. Next leg was on the A330 on the older Business Class seat. Much narrower seat but can't say that I was a lot less comfortable - obviously if given a choice, I would have picked the 787 Business Class Studio over this seat!). Still had a good sleep and a good breakfast, other than the fact that the plane did not have running water on board (they had bottles of water sitting in the toilets, thankfully the toilet did flush). They couldn't serve hot drinks on board without running water, so everyone had to live with juices and water for breakfast.

On reaching Abu Dhabi airport, I approached the Transfer Desk at the arrivals terminal. I had wait for 15-20 minutes before my turn came. This was as bad as checking in all over again. But had no choice. When I finally reached the counter and presented my papers, I was told that the flight was full and there are no seats. I was surprised. I had a confirmed seat in my hand but no seat. My flight was scheduled to leave Abu Dhabi at 10:00 pm and it was around 7:45 pm. The counter guy made a call and after a long time told me that he can put me on a flight next day after noon at 2:00 pm which was 16 hours after my scheduled flight. When I told him that was too late, he made me wait for more time and finally offered to put me on a flight to Mumbai and then from there to New Delhi - so I would again reach New Delhi late afternoon the next day. This was appalling. In the meantime I realised that all the counters at the transfer desk had the same problem. Etihad had overbooked all flights and passengers were being harassed. People were going to Egypt or Australia or Hyderabad. There were other flights during the night and early morning from Abu Dhabi to New Delhi but Etihad had overbooked all and I could not get a seat on any flight. Finally the counter guy told me that they could not help me and I should go to transfer desk on terminal 1. By this time the airport security area through which I had to pass to go to Terminal 1 had become extremely crowded. There was no air conditioning.  No queue and total chaos. With great difficulty, I managed to pass through that and reached the Transfer Desk. The guy at the counter quickly offered me a seat on a 2:55 am flight, a meal voucher and 200$ compensation.

Travelling out, comfort: Travelling from Amsterdam to Sydney, with a short lay over in Abu Dhabi, we were on two A340-500's. The leg room wasn't ideal, but it was doable. Service: The servicing staff was ok. Nothing fancy, but okay. At the end of the flight, they offer vouchers for their air-miles service, and it is clear that the stewards/desses are paid extra if they can sign on new people to the air-miles scheme. It was a little intimidating. Travelling home, comfort: Travelling Sydney to Abu Dhabi, we found ourselves once again on an A380-800. The leg room was appalling. My girlfriend at 173 cm was under pressure from the legroom. But there was simply no way for me to fit in those seats. Add to that, that my seat couldn't extend back, which meant I was stuck between the reclined seat in front of me and my own seat. I could literally see the forehead of the guy in front of me. We were told stories of how the legroom on the A380 is larger than normal. But the legroom on the A340 is better by at least 5 cm. During our flight, my entertainment system broke down, and it took 50 minutes to bring it back online, and no one seemed to understand the problem or offer a solution better than ""we have to restart the system - we dont know how long it will take"".

They didn't provide me seats and food that I had already confirmed in e-mail and was provided on my way to Thailand. Staff was rude. In Mumbai I thought it would be better since there is Etihad Airways staff but they were worse. Not helping with seats nor food, nor being polite. Also I was denied excess to lounge in Mumbai without a reason although I have right and I confirmed that before buying ticket.

Again I watched as my husband who's not ordered food awoke and placed an order which arrived in under 10 minutes. And still I waited as people around me were served but it felt like I was once again wearing my invisibility cloak. Finally in exasperation my husband called the steward who seemed to be in charge and asked if she could find out what had happened to my food. She went off and then came to explain that they had an inexperienced staff and apologised for the delay. She returned with my food shortly afterwards. It was as bad as the night before's offering.

First flight (MAN-AUH) I asked at checkin if we could have exit seats as me and my travel partner both stand over 6ft tall. Was told this was not possible unless we paid an additional £75 per flight. I expect low cost airlines to charge for exit seats, not a premium airline. Boarded the plane (A340-600) which has a 2-4-2 seat configuration. Decent seat pitch but minimal legroom.

Second flight (AUH-BKK) on Boeing 777-300, no real issues. Staff were friendly and courteous. Multiple drinks runs. Worth noting that this plane was half full. Seat pitch noticeably poorer with a 3-4-3 config but we were lucky that the seat between us was empty. Returning (BKK-AUH) was when the real problems started. Full flight on an A340-600. Plane was 45 minutes late leaving due to refuelling. This wouldn't have been an issue had the following 18 hours not been so spectacularly bad. Screen in front of me was omitting no sound whatsoever with my headphones or my travel partners.

Obviously not receiving air miles would not constitute a bad experience on its own, but this was just to illustrate just how little they care.

The plane being new and cutting edge, sold itself. The service was at best, mediocre and the cabin crew showed their lack of experience in confusion and getting mixed up. With a ‘light’ flight, there seemed more a gossip and snacking culture rather than a commitment to looking after their ‘guests’. I had pre-ordered AVML, but was told I should have the veg pasta on the menu, which I did. Then they discovered that the AVML was in the oven, so I agreed to try it out. The AVML was awful! It was as bad as a hospital meal, bland, tasteless, half cooked and not at all AVML. More like kosher or post recuperation food served by nursing staff. The crew apologised for not having AUH landing cards on board – another example of Etihad Airways lack of organisation. Had it been a full flight, I am sure utter mix ups and confusion would have prevailed. The cabin crew did the minimum work and apart from the ambience of the new A380, this one really felt like a budget airline flight. Abu Dhabi to Delhi was a one-off experience! Long queues prevailed at the gate as staff was not able to handle the various combinations of passports, visas and baggage. The process was extremely slow with officials running around, and when we were bundled off the buses onto the aircraft, a compact A320, the cabin crew were not able to handle the seating of passengers, who were allowed to freely roam, change seats, bunch together, shout across the aisles at each other – in chaos. The cleanliness of the aircraft also left something to be desired as one could clearly see grease on windows and unprepared seat pockets (litter in torn literature, left over chewing gum etc.). My seat cushion kept on slipping away forwards, coming off the seat frame. Its Velcro had seen better days. The cover on the seat cushion also came off – a thoroughly uncomfortable situation throughout the flight. Once airborne, Etihad chose to serve dinner. The choice is clearly yours, but at 3:30am (AUH) (4:30am DEL), would it not have been better to have served a substantial snack or a light breakfast rather than dinner, serving which was an ordeal for all in cramped cabin space on this plane. My meal was once again comic. The Serbian hostess told me that they had run out of the veg option, so she ‘could offer me lamb or chicken’. She obviously had no idea! What was the point proudly distributing the menu? I was served flat Coca Cola out of the last remains of a bottle of Coke and she insisted it was ‘fresh’ and not ‘flat’ as it sure was. When I said that I had pre-ordered AVML, she said that might be in the front galley. When the trolley service finished ten minutes later, I was half way through rice salad, bread and Coke, the ‘special’ meal arrived. It was OVML and had clearly been opened previously – I thought it may have even been from another discarded tray! The most uninviting chow mein in it was clearly not my request.

I have never in my life watch passengers carrying their baggage over their head, barge to the front of the queue, shout, get angry and then achieve their desire in such an outrageous way. To see the Etihad staff shout and abuse some passengers was also totally unacceptable; quite clearly they could not cope. I was virtually the last person on the plane which was delayed for 2.5 hours and as such missed my onward connection in Abu Dhabi resulting in a 9 hour stay at the Airport Premier Inn and missing my first night in my Bangkok Hotel for which I paid around USD100 which has still not been reimbursed. The customer service has been dreadful since my emails and forms to the Etihad system were ignored. Eventually I received 20,000 air miles after writing to the boss and an apology. 20,000 airmiles are not the same as flying 20,000 miles in the air mind you. I have made some enquiries and believe I will receive a small discount if I fly this route with them again; I also receive junk mail from Etihad Airways now as well which I don't like.

"""crew could be hit or miss""",3,2015-10-30,"Many things could be said about Etihad experience, and memorable is definitely one of them. I flew round trip AUH-DUB-AUH and the subpar experience started from Abu Dhabi Airport, the fact that most of the airport is still under major renovation and construction alone does not justify the cost of the ticket Etihad charges. Let's start with check-in, the online check in can only be done via website as there is no app that would do it for you (EK or QR have great apps, for example), therefore, there is no such a thing as an online boarding pass integrated into the passbook of the phone. Here are the positive points about the ground service at AUH: Escort service could be provided to sort out the documents and immigration. The Premium Lounge is indeed very nice, albeit not many options for the buffet. Negatives about the ground service at AUH: Being bussed to the aircraft is not luxurious however you try to market it. The Airport is just horrendous The in-flight experience AUH-DUB: Lovely food, I loved the option of eating whenever I chose to. Lovely options for beverages. Crew could be hit or miss. On both legs of my journey, some crew were nice and others were not so great. One of the crew even went as far as to lie: ""Captain just informed me we were above Ankara."" I later found out we never got close to Turkey, which left me puzzled. The reason I had this conversation in the first place was the fact that E-BOX did not work properly and had no flight information. Ground services at DUB: The check in was the same as in AUH. Nothing great. The Airport is wonderful and a joy to go through. The lounge was wonderful too. Great ambience, quiet with attentive staff. In-flight experience DUB-AUH: One word, horrible. No drink was offered to me and my colleague simply because the crew never passed by our side of the cabin. Amenity kit was used by someone else, and I had to ask for a new one. I had to ask for my glass of champagne 3 times, which thankfully arrived 30 minutes after take off. Some meals were not available. I was not asked when I would like to have my food, nor was I asked for my preference of drinks. The food arrived with still water (not ordered by me), the wine I had asked for was not served either. When I asked for sparkling water, the guy just poured some into my half empty glass of still water. No questions asked. Cheese selections consisted of one type of cheese decorated with fruits and berries. The name should be changed to ""Fruit section with added cheese"" The overall feel was as if I had to beg for the service that is supposed to be provided. The cabin had also not been cleaned well as I found a crushed dry bread loaf under my seat, which thoroughly covered the floor under my feet for the remainder of the flight.

Before booking my flight to Hong Kong from Manchester (with a 2 hour stop over in Abu Dhabi), I researched Etihad Airways on here and I was surprised by the luke-warm and even negative, response. But having travelled with them, they are understandable reviews. Leaving Manchester, the aircraft was late boarding, and late taking off - due to the fact that the plane arrived later from its previous journey. It was a farce when queuing. Most airlines wait for clear space before allowing you to go through the gate, down the ramp and enter the aircraft. Etihad, however, started checking boarding passes well before the aircraft was ready, meaning we had a 25 minutes wait inside the airplane access ramp, waiting while the stewardesses finished off their preparations and loaded the disabled passengers. Perhaps we could have waited in the lounge? On the flight, those at the back of the cabin soon found that they ran out of food options - the chicken was the first to go. That said it was the best airline food I have had.  Seat room was limited for a tall guy like myself, but not too restrictive. However, when people in from of you recline your seats, you have no other option but to do the same yourself, such is the lack of space. Most of the films are not new, and there is a limited range of choices. With the Milan fashion week coming up at the time of departure, the airline (a sponsor) had presented the in-flight entertainment along the theme of fashion. Most films were based around that theme. I would prefer just a bunch of movies where I can control the theme of what I watch. Finding your way around Abu Dhabi Airport is fairly straightforward, clearly laid out and information desks if you get stuck. From Abu Dhabi to Hong Kong, there was not much support for the Chinese speaking passengers on the flight. The menu,and the entertainment system, was in English or Arabic, with little for Chinese. In the end, being a basic speaker myself, I ended up translating the menu for a group of around 25 Chinese people.

Etihad seriously lacks in a lot of areas. I expected so much more from such a high profile airline. Check-in was the best part as a member of staff noticed I am very tall and sourced an exit row seat for me which I was extremely thankful for as it was a 13hr flight, but the tired Boeing 777 had uncomfortable aged seats and I couldn't wait to land. I selected a non-lactose meal, and it seemed to be half the amount of the regular meal, why is this? I had no bread roll or desert (both didn't contain dairy). On a 13hr flight we were only given two small meals and a snack which was a muffin. I didn't see any attendants for hours in between meals. I only noticed one lot of drinks being bought round, and other customers had to constantly call for drinks and food, and when asked it seemed such a big effort for them. The attendant who served me hardly spoke English, and didn't have a clue what was going on. I asked for a coffee and the cup wasn't even half full. I asked her why, and she said she ran out of coffee! Abu Dhabi airport shops were all high end expensive boutiques, not much opportunities for normal people. Most travelers were swarming the food court and alcohol and tobacco shops, no one was in the expensive ones. Toilets were disgusting! I asked at a transfer desk if there was any way I could get an exit row seat, I was just told ""no, the flight is full"". Unexceptable in my opinion.  It is so uncomfortable and stressful having to sit in a regular seat when you are very tall, it makes the journey a nightmare.

AUH-JNB flight on an old Jet Airways aircraft .The only reason I travel Etihad is because I always seem to find the cheapest fare. I would not recommend otherwise. This was my 8th trip with them and I can only say that they are consistently bad!,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,2,,False,
Etihad Airways customer review,9,2015-06-01,20th April 2015. I flew from Manchester to Abu Dhabi-Abu Dhabi to Sydney return. I was very happy with the seating which I found to be comfy and reasonably spacious. The staff were pleasant and helpful and the food was adequate. The inflight entertainment was great. All in all great value. Abu Dhabi airport has an Irish bar where you will pay £7.50 for a pint of Stella. There is also a smoking room in the bar for those of you who smoke. On arrival at Abu Dhabi you do feel like your in a cattle market but once through passport control its fine. I would fly with Etihad again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Etihad Airways customer review,10,2015-05-31,First time with Etihad. Flight 0454 Abu Dhabi to Sydney 13 hours. The flight departed 20 mins late but the captain explained the problem with traffic in the area. Face washes menus kiddies packs comfort packs with sox etc brought around. Real ear phones not plugs etc. I had seat 23 d on the B777 aisle seat with a spare to my right which was helpful. The cabin was neat and clean. The cabin staff were really good. Nothing was a problem. This is a long flight but staff came through every 30 to 40 minutes with water and / or juice. Drinks were served before the meal and with the meal. Meals were ok but I don't really eat much on long flights. I do enjoy a beer and had no problem getting an extra one or two as we approached Sydney. The cabin staff were friendly and attentive. I have flown with all other carriers on the Kangaroo route and on the basis of this flight I would rate Etihad up with the others. At this time they are very competitive so I rate them very good value. We arrived 30 minutes early.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True,
Etihad Airways customer review,5,2015-05-20,Travelled from Australia via Singapore to Abu Dhabi last month. The flight over wasn't too bad and the crew were pretty efficient and pleasant but on the whole I thought it was a shabby cabin with uncomfortable seats that were almost impossible to recline in fact I thought they were fixed upright as no one seemed to be able to recline their seat. When we travelled back from Istanbul the flight was worse. Once again seats that did not recline without a real struggle and crew that seemed indifferent to the needs of passengers and they seemed to operate in a chaotic manner at meal times. We waited ages for the meal then didn't get the bread roll and after the meal were completely missed when it came to the longed for cup of tea. I had to ask for a drink of water once as they did not regularly come around and I felt like it was an imposition. Some of the crew seemed unfriendly and cold and it didn't make you want to use that airline again. We missed our connecting night flight due to a delay and the next day Etihad didn't put my name on the passenger list for the next leg home only my husband which wasn't ideal and took a long time to sort out leaving us to rush to get on the plane without breakfast or anything. Wouldn't go on that airline again too budget and not enough comfort weren't allowed to book emergency row seats either and my husband and I are both tall people.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,4,,False,
Etihad Airways customer review,10,2015-05-18,May 10th Kathmandu - Abu Dhabi EY293. May 11th Abu Dhabi - London Heathrow EY019. I was in Nepal to provide relief aid after the earthquake and was asked to return on the next flight out of the country. Some people would be annoyed that the flight from Kathmandu to Abu Dhabi was delayed which subsequently meant that I missed my connecting flight from Abu Dhabi to London however I was not. The flight from Kathmandu to Abu Dhabi was great I can't complain one bit. I was given my desired seat there was even a seat left between me and a fellow passenger which meant loads of space the leg room was huge. Also as a fairly large guy I was satisfied that the tray wasn't balancing on my stomach for this flight. Once I landed in Abu Dhabi I just missed my connecting flight. The security team were very quick with the bag checks and everything so I can't fault them. I went and spoke to the gentleman at the transfers desk he put me on the next flight out I requested an aisle seat and was provided with an exit door seat. The flight from Abu Dhabi to London was excellent. I'll be sure to fly with Etihad again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Etihad Airways customer review,4,2015-05-18,Flew from Abu Dhabi to LAX on code share flight operated by Etihad. Check in at airport was very cold and almost rude. This was a first the check in staff has been excellent in the past. Flight delayed with poor notifications. Crew was pleasant but not friendly.

Etihad Airways customer review,4,2015-05-18,My husband and I flew from Dublin to Perth via Abu Dhabi and back on the Airbus A330. From Abu Dhabi to Perth and back we had the same seats 31A and 31C. In 31C there was a terribly cold draft on the aisle seat which resulted in my arriving in Perth with the most severe sinusitis I have ever had and my right shoulder was very sore. I wore a long sleeved shirt a woolen jumper and had the blanket pulled up but despite that it was freezing. On the way back my husband sat in 31C and he had a T Shirt long sleeved shirt and woolen jumper and still had to get his raincoat down and wear that with the hood up. Other parts of the plane were not so cold so there must be a problem with the cold air vents blowing on 31C. It would be useful for one of your crew to fly long-haul in that seat so that you can get the measure of the problem. On this plane there are no individual air vents so presumably the cold air comes in at one spot and that must be just behind 31C. I would recommend this airline to others but not that seat.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,False,
Etihad Airways customer review,9,2015-05-18,San Francisco (SFO) to Bangalore (BLR) via Abu Dhabi (AUH). Price was reasonably low. Etihad maintained regular communication about my travel and allowed me to upgrade to Business class. I skipped that offer and decided to travel in economy class. The day before travel I did online check-in and printed my boarding pass. On the day of travel all I had to do was to drop my bags. I thought it was a simple process of dropping them off. No Etihad agent checks the cabin bag for its size and weight and it can not exceed even 1/2 pound. There was no delay in the flight. There was a 10 minute delay. However passengers were greeted by crew members and they helped me to place the cabin luggage. They were cordial and helpful. We were given a hot towel upon arrival as well as the meal menu card. Crew were very cordial and willing to help. After serving the food they ensured the blinds were closed and there was no service for next couple of hours unless called by passengers. There were some empty seats and I was quick to use them up. I was surprised when the crew handed over my special meals to my changed seat. Flight arrived at Abu Dhabi an hour earlier than scheduled and hence we got an extra hour to browse through airport shops. My next flight was in 2.5 hours. What I noticed is that no compliance to ADA rules for Seniors and others who requires wheelchair access to rest rooms or showers. Passengers have to climb three steps to use the rest rooms. The rest rooms at the airport were not clean. Maybe that's the standard AUH airport maintains. I boarded my next flight to Bangalore (BLR) and it was a smooth ride with a different set of crew and services of crew was excellent. I traveled back from Bangalore to SFO via Abu Dhabi and had an even better experience. Overall I am very satisfied with Etihad and would be happy to travel again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Etihad Airways customer review,9,2015-05-16,We travelled from Manchester to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. Long Haul flights are not the easiest but our flight with Etihad was more than acceptable. The staff were polite efficient and provided an excellent service. The inflight entertainment system was far more reliable than some other airlines. The food served was probably some of the best quality I have been served on either long or short haul flights. All flights were on time. The aircraft was clean and tidy and the pillows blankets and comfort kits were more than adequate. The new style pillows were particularly comfortable. Abu Dhabi airport was probably the only slight negative. We were crushed into a small holding space and let through into security a few at a time. It was far too small a space to accommodate the number of passengers passing through. Hopefully this will be sorted once the building work is complete. We have travelled long haul with various airlines in the past and Etihad rate up with the best such as Cathay and Singapore and rate far higher than Qatar Airlines.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Etihad Airways customer review,4,2015-05-13,Recently flew Manchester to Abu Dhabi and onward to Saigon Vietnam. I was shocked at the lack of legroom on these flights and found them to be very cramped and uncomfortable for a long haul flight. Incredibly the hours flight from Saigon to Danang via Vietnam airlines was much more comfortable. I think that Etihad would be far better spending money on improving economy class than paying Nicole Kidman to advertise the comforts of business class for the wealthy few. The food was somewhat poor as well. For the first time in 35 years of flying my luggage was not transferred onto the connecting flight to Saigon and I was without it for 2 days. Etihad needs to improve considerably.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,False,
Etihad Airways customer review,3,2015-05-12,"Bangalore to San Francisco and back and faced lot of problems with the 4 flights (BLR-AHU-SFO-AHU-BLR). 1) 2 of the 4 flights were delayed and the AHU-SFO by more than 2 hours. 2) The inflight entertainment is average. 3) Food was ok. Nothing great but not bad either. 4) I fly economy almost all the time. Even by economy standards I found the seats in AHU-SFO sector to be very congested. It was fine in BLR-AHU. 5) The worst part of the entire thing was the staff experience. In the SFO-AHU flight at least 4 times I had the staff lady tell me ""I will come back to you"" when I asked something and then disappeared. This happened for simple things like water or when I asked her to take a used glass from my seat. Both times I walked to the area and got the work done. I normally choose Singapore Airlines or Emirates. I am sure I will fly Etihad again only if I desperately have to go.",False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,False,

I flew from San Francisco to Abu Dhabi and then to Kathmandu and back to Abu Dhabi in Business Class. Then Abu Dhabi to Los Angeles in Economy class. My flight from KTM to ABU got delayed. They were kind enough to fit me onto a flight to Los Angeles the next morning and provided me with a voucher to spend a night at the airport hotel. I upgraded my ticket to Business class from SFO to KTM. Compared to other international airlines their service is poor in business class standard. It took 1.5 hrs to get my drink after the plane took off in Business class - KTM to AUH. On the way back I decided to try Economy class from Abu Dhabi to USA and found out it was the most horrible flight experience I had in the past 26 years flying back and forth from USA to other countries. Let me make it clear it was all about flight attendants. Sixteen hours of journey itself is not that easy. One needs to be hydrated constantly to keep with the long journey. However attendants treated passengers like they are looking for free food and handouts. It was the most pathetic scene. If they can not provide ""free"" food or drinks how about selling?

Etihad Airways customer review,8,2015-05-05,I recently flew from Abu Dhabi to Dublin return on an A330 (SYD-AUH leg operated by Virgin Australia also good). It had been many years since I had made this journey and after reading the predominantly negative reviews I was worrying that long haul travel had deteriorated over those years. Everything was however much the same. I think people need to realise that long haul in economy isn't particularly comfortable but you can make the most of it. I put it in perspective I had 14 hours with nothing to do but watch movies read books and drink wine. People brought me food and I didn't have to do anything for anyone else. No phone emails or pager to distract me. The aircraft was clean seats reasonably comfortable food was fine and the entertainment was good. The staff were friendly and check in and boarding went smoothly. The only glitch was that my bag got delayed by a day on my way there and back however I think that this may have been from the VA side of the operation.

Etihad Airways customer review,1,2015-05-04,"Etihad Flight from Abu Dhabi to London last week was very poor. Old plane with little legroom (and we're only 5'3""!). Narrow seats and inattentive staff. We had enquired about the cost to upgrade to Business but no seats available. After a splendid Virgin Premium Economy flight Sydney to Abu Dhabi this flight two days later was a shocker. The pre-flight organisation at the airport was chaotic. We're trying to arrange an upgrade for the first leg home (Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi) and look forward to our Virgin Premium Economy Abu Dhabi to Sydney two days later. This poor service at airport and on flight was astonishing because Abu Dhabi itself was enjoyable - neither chaotic or disappointing.",False,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,

For all the hype about their premium products their Economy product is nothing short of dreadful. We chose to fly Etihad with our 2 young boys (3 and 1 years old) from Manchester to Sydney because of their so called ""Flying Nanny"" service. Unfortunately we felt let down by the lack of attention our children got from this apparent qualified nanny who seemed on most occasions to be missing in action and when this Nanny was about she seemed less than enthusiastic wanting to interact with the children. I thought nannies were supposed to actually like children. Now I know food on airplanes isn't supposed to be amazing especially in economy but the matter they classified as ""food"" was about as tasty as a smelly sock after football practise in fact a more accurate description of what they were serving up would be slop with a fancy name. I'm pretty sure the sautéed potatoes was cardboard and that kofta isn't a sausage that has had the life shrivelled out of it. The drink selection wasn't better with a smorgasbord of typical commercial larger which leave a disappointing metallic after-taste. In total we flew 4 legs with this lame imitation airline and on each occasion we were delayed by an hour. That's 4 hours in total that. Part of the reason is a lack of staff at the check in counters and the other being the shambolic nature of Abu Dhabi airport where planes are parked willy nilly along the tarmac waiting for a gate to load the latest bunch of impatient and weary travellers while arrivals are ushered into buses like cattle and given a tour of the entire airport before finally dropping arrivals at their intended destination.

Etihad Airways customer review,8,2015-04-30,I have used Etihad for years now but haven't traveled with them for the last 3 years. We booked flight MAN-HKT and PEK-MAN both via AUH. After reading the reviews on here I was wishing I had booked with Emirates or Qatar. I have since returned and couldn't really fault Etihad at all. What people need to realize when adding a review is that Long Haul travel in Economy isn't great its what you make it. All our flights were on time my wife got her special meals and I had one of the best meals onboard a plane. We had exit seats on the return legs that we booked and paid extra for in advance and this really did make a difference. They have introduced and new pillow that's amazingly comfortable and allowed me to sleep when I don't normally. We were very satisfied with Etihad this time the only let down was the congestion in Abu Dhabi airport its far too small now but you can see the new airport is well under way so this issue should be gone soon.

Etihad Airways customer review,4,2015-04-27,Recently flew economy from Sydney-Tehran Istanbul-Sydney with Etihad and overall was not that impressed. On my first flight Sydney - Abu Dhabi I had selected my seat months in advance as I prefer the aisle then the day of check in I saw that I had lost my aisle seat and had been placed in the middle. I managed to get an aisle seat by checking online the next day but only by chance as my several calls to Etihad staff said that there was nothing that they could do about it. Check in staff was okay but pretty cold. In-Flight service terrible barely saw attendants and only two drinks services on a 14 hour flight. Entertainment system was okay but not as good as Emirates. Flight from Abu Dhabi-Tehran was better but only because I got upgraded to business. Return flights from Istanbul-Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi to Sydney were also pretty bad and the service left a lot to be desired. One thing that really annoys me is that on all of my flights they stated that the boarding time was one hour before departure but then you would get to the gate and only board 30 minutes before.

Etihad Airways customer review,9,2015-04-23,I had a return flight from Tokyo to Abu Dhabi and I was upgraded to a First Class seat. The 12 hours flight was my best experience to date as I was greeted by the flight manager seated and instructed to relax and enjoy. The seat was comfortable and spacious later on the flight attendant prepared the seat to be a bed which was on par with hotels beds and I spent 8 hours sleeping out of the 12 hours flight. The menu had exquisite selections and the in- flight chief made sure that the food was served promptly and perfectly. The food was a delight to have and memorable to experience. The flight manager was attentive and a good listener he literally meant his instruction to relax and enjoy. Ultimately the experience was overwhelming and sublime.

Etihad Airways customer review,1,2015-04-23,Horrible travel experience to Toronto. Seat change multiple times. When I booked the ticket I reserved the 44A Window Side Seat and it was Confirmed. Boarding Pass confirmed and showed that I got that 44A. When I boarded the flight in Abu Dhabi I got Seat 44A and I was settled and waiting for take off. A few minutes before take off another passenger came and claimed that he had reserved seat 44A. Finally they asked me to vacate this seat just before takeoff. I was given another seat which was not a window seat. The new seat did not have the sound system working for the entertainment. Finally I was placed in seat 55A in the very last row seat close to the toilet and food preparation area. When the flight took off I tried to watch a movie the audio was not working for this one too. I moved to the adjacent seat 55B which was unoccupied however the audio did not work there either. I informed the flight attendant to reset the audio or do something about it however they looked helpless and were unable to resolve this problem. After the meal I tried to move to yet another seat (54F) this time to try to watch a movie but had to get up to make way for the original user who wanted to spread out and sleep using all the 2 seats I was once again forced to leave this seat.

The seat I selected when I checked in online was given to an another guest which eventually they gave me the seat reluctantly. The seat was unbelievably congested for myself a medium sized person and I did not receive a personal care kit. The menu offers mainly Arabic and Japanese selections which I found lacking. It took the flight attendant literally an hour to serve me a bottle of water. I selected a Japanese breakfast and they served it promptly however the dishes tastes were bland compared to Japanese dishes I experienced later on my trip. Hence I was really underwhelmed by the experience but maintained my composure throughout the flight and really felt sympathetic towards travelers who were seated in the Economy cabin for 10 hours and surely they had their share of inconveniences.

I am usually on OneWorld and prefer Qatar but was most impressed with Etihad. Not as flashy as Qatar in some instances but genuine sincere and excellent hard and soft product. The Jet flights have good seats - I was worried about the herringbone seating but was excellent. The 787 business studio is world class - first class quality and beats Qatar business. The food is very good - Qatar may be a bit better here and also in the amenity kits etc but Etihad flies first on most routes and Qatar does not so that may explain the difference in the business product. The lounge in AUH is good - Qatar is slightly better but Etihad has an excellent spa and the services are excellent and so is the food. Bombay lounge is the shared lounge and is excellent!

Flight was full food and drink orders were taken prior to take off and served individually after we reached the cruise. All very comfortable. Abu Dhabi airport is extremely busy when the morning wave of flights arrive. Good to see that the new terminal is taking shape in the centre of the airfield but it will be 2017 before it is operational. Still given the limitations and the use of buses to take passengers to and from the aircraft it seems to work okay. Flights from BNE to DUB were full. Very good service on board. Easy transit stop in Singapore and very efficient boarding process. Transit in AUH was easier as it was the second wave of flights at the airport and much quieter. However if you board through terminal 1 be prepared for a bit of chaos! Flight to DUB was good. I think that it was used as a training flight for three food and beverage managers.

Had ordered kids meals for my 3 kids but none were given - I had to go up to the galley and ask for them personally. Food was well below my expectations. Returning AUH-JFK was terrible. Check-in took 45 minutes because the agent couldn't print our baggage tags. Boarding and the US ICE Pre- clearance was a breeze and we were among the first to board. My wife a doctor herself 6 months pregnant and traveling with a letter from her physician clearing her for travel suffered the most. Once onboard and in our seats a flight attendant noticed my wife was pregnant and asked for her letter. Flight attendant said that the letter was insufficient (remember that this was the return flight - had already been allowed to fly to AUH and had checked-in at the desk gone through two security checkpoints US Customs and the gate agent) and tried to kick her off the flight. After a ground crew member came to ask about our bags (to remove them from the aircraft) and realizing that they would have to remove 7 passengers and 14 checked bags they allowed us to stay but only after delaying the flight for an hour. Food on the return flight was terrible. Small portions poor selection (didn't give us a menu at all). Considering that the return was a 14 hour flight they should have given us more food during the voyage. At least the rest of the cabin crew was relatively nicer but not overly so. Lavatories were actually kept in decent shape and they gave us plenty of water to drink. Upon arrival at JFK the gate staff was rude pushy and noticeably cranky.
