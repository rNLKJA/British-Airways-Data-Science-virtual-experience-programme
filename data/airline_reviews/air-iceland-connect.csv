"""Absolutely wonderful flight""",10,2018-06-06,"Not Verified |  Reykjavik to Akureyri. I have never been on a friendlier serviced aircraft than this! Absolutely wonderful flight, only 35 minutes, and quite a unique experience on a propeller plane. Absolutely love the onboard ""travel journal"" where you can read other passengers adventures and write your own in, very sweet! Would love to fly with them again next time I'm in Iceland!",False,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Reykjavik to Akureyri,May 2018,5,5,,4,4,,True
"""really enjoyed the flight""",10,2018-03-30,Egilsstadir to Reykjavík. Check in was a breeze. Waiting area very clean. Boarding was very easy just showing ticket and photo ID. It was a 45 minute flight. They served tea or coffee with a chocolate. I really enjoyed the flight as I did not want to travel by road again. I will fly them again.,True,Bombadier Q400,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Egilsstadir to Reykjavík,March 2018,5,5,,5,5,,True
