"""free drinks great snacks""",10,2018-08-20,La Vegas to Burbank. Cheap flight and free drinks great snacks. Great  legroom(I'm 6'2). Lounge in LAS was super nice. No TSA I was put onto another airplane (to shorten the delay) without wifi but plane was supposed to have outlets and wifi. There was a delay but the staff and crew were helpful and informative. The captain even flew a lot faster to shorten the delay. After landing I received an email from JetsuiteX apologizing for the delay and issued me a $50 voucher. JetsuiteX eliminates everything that's wrong with flying. They even tried to fill up the remaining seats on the plane with people on the later flight.,True,E135,Solo Leisure,Business Class,La Vegas to Burbank,July 2018,5,5,,5,5,,True
