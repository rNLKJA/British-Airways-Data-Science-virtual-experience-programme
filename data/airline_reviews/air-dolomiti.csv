Air Dolomiti customer review,4,2009-09-17,MUC BLQ return in business. Exceeded expectations. My heart sank at MUC when I realised it was a turboprop flight and I was expecting a LCC experience. Instead I had a nice breakfast of cold meats and bread rolls on the way out. On the return leg they served a nice dessert but I am not a dessert person. Flights were slightly delayed both times but not significantly so. Check in at BLQ was very efficient and the Marconi lounge has its own security lane which makes the whole process more pleasant.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
