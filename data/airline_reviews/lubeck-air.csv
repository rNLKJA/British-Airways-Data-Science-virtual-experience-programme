"""Great little airline""",10,2022-10-02,"Not Verified | Great little airline. The direct flight from Lübeck to Bergen is perfect for me and my schedule, will definitely use it more often in the future. Even got snacks, which I usually don't get on this distance. Very pleased with the speed and efficiency.",False,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Lübeck to Bergen,September 2022,5,5,,5,5,,True
"""Wonderful regional airline""",10,2020-10-16,"Wonderful regional airline from Luebeck! I had a chance to try this airline and the experience was quite comfortable. Boarding procedure is in order and each passenger must disinfect hands. The legspace is good and cabin is simple yet neat. The crew were happy to engage with passengers and the best part was that they serve a small meal on each flight! I really appreciate that and the meal was simple yet very tasty and filling. You can even book a veggie meal while booking flight. Beyond what LH can even offer on regional flights. While deboarding, they served caramel candies. This experience with Lübeck Air took me back to old school days which I miss terribly in aviation world. Keep up the standards and service because this will set you apart!",True,ATR72,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Luebeck to Stuttgart,October 2020,5,5,,5,5,,True
