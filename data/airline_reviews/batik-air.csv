To be fair the staff picked me up at the plane and made an effort to catch the flight, but we only had 7 minutes so it was wasted effort. We ended up at the customer service. While pleasant, no one spoke English, which was not really their fault but given they serve international customers, I would have thought English speaking was a requirement. After two hours I finally got my luggage and a car to take me to a local transit hotel, the Ibis. There are two at the airport, the Budget and Styles. They put me in styles. I would give the hotel less than 1 star. I left and paid for my own room at Ibis styles. Really, for business class, they use a very low quality hotel? They don’t even put their crew there.

When I checked in on 29/12 the person informed me that my flight back to Jakarta will be changed, not to CGK but to Halim Airport! That was surprising and scaring, because that means that I have to travel from Halim to CGK (2 hours by Damri bus). In CGK I have to get a connecting flight from Jakarta to Dubai. This was realy a very nervous time. But the staff was very understanding and finally provided me a new ticket (a print) of another flight from JGJ to CGQ! I checked in and went to the lounge.

I waited for about 15 minutes and than the lady told me that someone will bring me to the Lounge and after that they will hand me a boarding pass. It was a great business class experience.

My experience on board their flights have always been pleasant. Cabin crew service was good, hot meals delicious, flight entertainment was up to date, and the plane was new. 2 days ago, I boarded Batik Air ID 7521 from Jakarta to Surabaya. As usual the cabin crew were ever courteous, pleasant and helpful. I have traveled on some of the major airlines for my work but this trip was even better. Not feeling that great after the long journey from hotel to airport and the long wait to board the plane in an airport that need a major renovation, I decided to head to the restroom to wash up before the plane takes off and there a cabin crew who not only ushered me from my seat but also opened the door of the restroom for me and checked on me when I was seated if I was feeling better. That little thought was the ""wow"" factor that sets Batik Air apart from most airlines in the region including some national airlines. The plane diverted back midway due to Surabaya runway being closed for repairs. The crew, both cockpit and cabin were very apologetic. I understood from the other cabin crews that they had been flying Jakarta-Solo-Surabaya-Jakarta earlier. That must have been tiring for them but they still put on a good show and the sincere smile they wore on their faces made the inconvenience most bearable especially with their hands clasp and apologizing to every passenger when they re-boarded the plane.
