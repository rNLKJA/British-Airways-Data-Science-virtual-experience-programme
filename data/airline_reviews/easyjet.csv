After that, the boarding process took ages, as some people had their passes invalidated due to the mentioned overbooking issue, meaning their seats (mine included) were unavailable.

They then provided us each with a soft drink and bag of crisps - hardly something sustainable for a delay of over 6 hours.

I have also flown a few times with a small backpack (to put under my feet) and a carry on luggage no problem with other airlines. The counter staff seemed unsympathetic at all and was pressuring me to just pay the CHF 76 and move along, standing in front of me just saying that it was impossible that all the stuff would fit (when I was trying to put the stuff from the small bag to the larger one.) She even went as far as to suggest to me and another family that we won't be allowed to test the luggage dimensions again and just to pay the 76 francs. (That's nearly as much as the ticket itself!) Even, when I did manage to fit the small suitcase into the slot, she said that it had to be smooth fit and that it couldn't be squeezed in. I have never expected such strictness and unreasonable behaviour from airport staff before and I can only believe it was out of spite that she said this as she realised that I had actually been able to fit the backpack into the carry on suitcase. I even saw her pressure the other family to pay just because they had an iPad that was not in the carry-on. When I got on, there was more than enough space in the overhead lockers and I had intended to put my backpack under my feet in any case to save space. In the end, I was forced by the same staff member to throw out my slippers as again she claimed they were an additional item of luggage. Seriously?

We spoke to easy jet about this and had to pay again! So we paid £275 each return originally and then the new flight out because they over booked and wouldn’t guarantee anything cost £150 each. To say I am disgusted with the airline is an understatement. To not exchange our outbound flight for free as they over booked our seats that we paid for months before is beyond as is leaving clients with very little alternatives than to either cancel the holiday or re book flights.

We went to the information desk and asked what to do next and we’re pointed out of the waiting lounge to the EasyJet desk. We stood in a queue of about 200 people, all upset, and waited a good 30 minutes before being told how to rebook flights. There were only two members of EasyJet staff tending to the 200+ passengers with cancelled flights, one employee on the customer service desk and one handing out leaflets.

Many people were surrounding the gate desk, asking what was happening. No one was getting a straight answer. Later we were told our flight was yet again cancelled for the second time.

That was fine, as they were honest about it from the word go, and I knew what to expect. In booking with them for a flight to Sofia from Gatwick, I looked on line, and was pleased to see that they now included one cabin bag and personal item in the cost of their tickets, so I booked with them. I assumed that this was an attempt to compete with other discount airlines like Ryanair, etc. We checked in on line, and while waiting at the gate to board, there was an EasyJet employee going through the line and picking people out of the line and charging them a 50 pound fine for having an extra bag. She got a number of people as she did this and had a machine at the ready to charge our credit cards. When I protested, she said that our personal items were too big, and that I should have read the terms and conditions more carefully. How many people do that? Without being a member of their ""Easy travellers"" group, it was the same as always, and we were ""fined"" 100 pounds because our personal items were too large. Had we known, we would have factored that additional charge into the cost of our flight, and would have likely flown with someone else as the EasyJet flight was much more than other airlines with the additional baggage cost, and they flew at inconvenient times, and into the nasty, old disused terminal at Sofia Airport.

This causes other passengers to check their app to discover, then relate to us, that the flight has been cancelled. Not delayed, just cancelled, and that the 17.50 departure is the next day, Saturday. Savvy frequent flyers rushed off, knowing what to do, some even got alternative flights with other airlines. We were left standing with no information and no instructions what to do. There were no EasyJet staff on hand to explain, to offer suggestions or just tell us where to go. Eventually we found an information desk and they directed us back out to the Departures hall (back through the Baggage Hall and Passport Control) to the EasyJet check in guest where the other 150 or more passengers were waiting to find out what they were going to do. I waited in the queue for about 90 minutes to get to the front to be handed a piece of paper with the name of a hotel on it and the next day's flight details. It took them 30 seconds to give it to me. When I asked why they didn't just hand that out to the whole queue the poor desk staff, (who were not EasyJet staff just local airport representatives), said sorry the 40 rooms they had at the airport were full so we had to go back into town. So a train back in Amsterdam, a taxi to the hotel (which was very nice) but no meal as promised by EasyJet and by then the kitchens were closed. The next day our replacement flight is the last one out of Amsterdam, not the first or anything else during the day. The amazing thing is that there are no EasyJet people to talk to. None of the staff are theirs, not the check in or the gate staff. They know EasyJet are rubbish so they are practised at apologising. Don't fall for the cheap price, it's not worth it.

"""We are extremely dissatisfied customers""",1,2018-12-16,"Let me begin by saying this is by far the worst flight experience I have ever had, and that begins prior to even leaving the tarmac. We begin by finding out our gate only 20 min prior to boarding. After rushing to the site and waiting in an incredibly slow moving line, we were met by a customer service representative stating our bags did not meet requirements, and would not give a clear explanation as to what the requirements were. As the line behind us was so long, she barked orders at us and suggested we pay the GBP50 baggage fee as opposed to finding a solution so she could get the line moving, and perhaps make some commission. Finally, she checked a bag for us for the price of dealing with her attitude. We continued onto the plane where we were made to wait 1hr to leave the tarmac due to a single missing passenger. We found this out through a series of unprofessional announcements from a male flight attendant. Beyond that, some occurrence with a lithium battery unidentified was in a checked bag, resulting in an additional 40 minute delay to find the device (this could be a source of easyjets abnormal 1 bag policy forcing someone to decompose their bag and repack it in a rush). His child was vomiting as they searched for his bag. On top of this, France went on strike during this process creating an even longer delay as we had to reroute around them. The only compensation to be offered was lukewarm water. Flight attendants could later be found charging people on the flight for snacks and beverages since they were now 2 hrs behind on dinner. This is the consequence of LGW’s overall disorganization as a facility along with the poor quality of easy jet to design practical tools for their employees to meet customer service needs.

I went up to the Easyjet desk and explained to them that I do not have my passport and it most likely was left at a shop in Central Rome.

Be extremely worried if you receive an email a few days before your flight if it says that the flight will be operated by easyJet Europe as this seems to mean inevitable delays happen. On this occasion the incoming flight arrived late and so missed its window to then avoid a weather related issue at Luton. EasyJet initially refused to pay out compensation because of the Luton related weather issues - when it was pointed out to them that their own flights landed at Luton around the time mine was due to land and BA had found it possible to depart Inverness later and arrive at Heathrow on time they then blamed more French traffic control and weather systems in Europe. This seems to be an airline that cannot respond to any small issue elsewhere in Europe and then meet its timetable. In future I will either use a more expensive but reliable flat carrier or the train.

It has cost me £510, a day at Stansted airport and ruined my husband’s birthday. We arrived at the airport at 11am for a flight at 1:05pm. We checked a bag in and went to departures. After going to the allocated gate about 45mins before flight departure time we waited and were told there was a technical issue with the plane and were then told that we would need to get another plane which was due to land shortly. Then an hour at the gate with no further news. Then there was an announcement saying we should go back to the departure lounge as there was a gate change. We were taken by bus back to the departure lounge and when we looked at the screen info it flashed up that the plane would be leaving in 1 hours time and that the gate was 81. I looked online at the Easyjet flight tracker which still said that the plane was due to leave about 20mins previous to the current time so was incorrect. So we were not sure of when the plane would actually leave and thought we’d wait for announcements or info on screen in the departure lounge. We kept looking at the screen and all it ever said was ‘Gate change’. It didn’t say ‘go to gate’, ‘boarding’ or ever again an expected departure time. Then after about 1.5 hours it just disappeared off the screen. We were alarmed but there is no information desk at stansted to ask anyone what is going on. We wandered around until eventually asking someone with a walkie talkie who happened to be walking through. She called and found out that since we had been sitting there waiting for information our bag had been removed from the plane and it had left. No announcements had been made, no information on the board. We couldn’t believe it. They had taken our bag off the plane but hadn’t bothered to make an announcement calling us to the gate. There was never anything in the board saying ‘go to gate’ ‘boarding’ etc. Basically they hadn’t updated the screen info. We then experienced the worst customer service ever. After being dumped with various people with no explanation of what was going on we ended up speaking to the so called ‘manager’ at the Easyjet desk. She was woman called Rochelle who made no apology for our situation and could not have been less helpful, she treated us with utter contempt. I’ve never known such awful customer service. She said we should call the Easyjet phone line (which is actually a call centre in South Africa). We did this and they said the communication failure was something we should take up with Easyjet at the airport.

easyJet customer review,9,2018-03-26,"Liverpool to Larnaca. I think that our recent experience clearly illustrates the difference companies like easyJet have made as far as foreign travel is concerned: we have just had a very enjoyable week’s holiday in Cyprus for less than it cost for just the flights on our first visit there over 30 years ago. On that occasion we were going to stay with friends and to reach Cyprus as “cheaply” as possible we had to drive to Heathrow, stay overnight and then travel via Budapest with a seven-hours’ layover in the airport there. Last week we had an hour’s drive to Liverpool and direct flights for two of us for a total of just over £140! We were not sure how we would cope with flights lasting 5 hours each way, as we normally restrict ourselves to 3 hours or less, but we equipped ourselves with plenty to occupy the time and the journeys were relatively painless. Both flights departed and arrived pretty promptly, cabin staff worked hard and efficiently without going over the top and the cockpit crews kept us informed. The plane on the outward journey had the new-style seats which we do not find particularly supportive though they were tolerable, but we were more comfortable on the return flight with the older, more thickly padded seats. Possibly the boarding procedure could have been handled better at Larnaca, but that might have been dictated by the airport rather than easyJet staff. One thing in particular struck me: the totally calm atmosphere on both flights – everyone seemed to be engrossed in or by whatever entertainment they had brought with them to pass the time, an indication perhaps that most clients know what to expect on an easyJet flight and are content with easyJet services, even if they do not bother to say so.",True,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Liverpool to Larnaca,March 2018,4,5,,4,5,,True,

This, according to many other reviews was frequently happening on this route and others. Problems occur, yes. But the lack of support and the lack of responsibility the airline took in the airport was astonishing. Compensation was offered for volunteers.

After the check-in staff also could not open the other 2 boarding passes, he issued us with paper passes, but he issued my son's pass twice and not mine causing further confusion and distress at the security gate. Overall, not happy with easyJet. But a positive point on easyJet in comparison with other budget carriers, they allow a child traveller to have a free check-in of a stroller / car seat.

Once you have checked in for a flight on the App, even if you change your reservation, the old boarding pass stays in the app instead of being deleted: confusing. The way to choose your seat is easy for the first flight but complicated for the return. Then you cannot change it yourself.  By the way, you can only check in until 2 hours before departure. I like to check in on the way to the airport once I know I will get my flight. No, you have to check in way before. Once, the check in with the app or via their website didn't work, so I tried to call the customer service helpline: waited 15 minutes before they answered saying they couldn't do anything. You are now on your way to the gate, it is 1/2 hour before your flight whose boarding gate is 10 minutes away. Normally no stress, not with easyjet, where they say your gate closes 25 minutes before your flight, so you run to realize it hasn't started boarding. In short, if you have a short connection, forget about your connecting flight.  You think you are better off with a more expensive Flexi fare ticket (that is what we travel with). Good thing is you could go fast lane at airport security, but in Paris at easyJet terminal there are no fast security lanes, while in Gatwick all the lanes are decently fast.  But then it is at the boarding gate that you realize how much you are robbed by speedy boarding dream: you are entitled to board first, but then you may be the one who waits the longest of all, standing in the jetway until you can board the plane.  The flight in itself is more or less OK, the staff are usually smiling, except when they bother you, at the first and emergency exit rows, to the point that you cannot have your sweater on your shoulders.

We were told that we could not book another flight to Madrid with Easyjet until Monday the 10th (in over 3 days) as their flights were fully booked until then. This was not true, as they were still offering flights for that weekend on their website. However, we couldn’t do anything about it as their ‘support’ staff were unresponsive and dismissive, so we went back home to central London, and tried to look up affordable alternatives that would get us to Madrid in time for the music festival we had paid a lot of money to attend, and to the Airbnb that we had already paid for as well.

I shall try and be candid and clear and as impartial as I can. Firstly, I found the website easy to use and clear and follow-up emails were constructive and informative. I found the Easyjet luggage charges to be very pricey. Check-in as operated in Toulouse was efficient and the staff well-presented and polite. While checking in I was aware of several elderly people struggling and no one being helped. Toulouse is often used by people travelling to and from Lourdes and as such attracts pilgrims and frail people seeking spiritual input. The flight to London was delayed by around 50 mins and passengers were herded into a waiting area. I witnessed an elderly gentleman struggle as there were no seats for him and staff ignored his pleas for help. I assisted the gentleman down a steep flight of stairs as the boarding process entailed steep stairs and then more stairs to board the flight. During the boarding of the flight only one crew member welcomed passengers and I saw 2 other crew members ignore elderly people struggling to place items into the overhead compartments. The safety demonstration as taken seriously and conducted in a professional manner. Snacks were available for purchase.

It took almost an hour until somebody came and finally let us on the bus. I could understand that things like diverting can happen, but the way EasyJet handled that is beyond terrible, I thought that cabin crew should never abandoned their passengers like this.

"""flight back was terrible""",1,2017-07-02,"✅ Verified Review | This is a direct return trip from London Luton Airport to Paris and back with easyJet. To be fair, the trip to Paris was ok, but the flight back was terrible, with not one, but a series of unpleasant occurrences. The problematic flight from Paris to London Luton was due to set off at 9:55pm, but was delayed by an hour and took off at 10:55pm Paris time. Despite the delay, the boarding procedures were extremely inefficient. There was no sense of urgency despite the tardiness, especially given the fact that this is such a late flight. The gate number also changed mid-way through the delayed hour. When we scanned the boarding pass, my friend was stopped by one of the staff as he was carrying two backpacks. Despite the fact some people's roller cabin luggage alone is the size of my friend's two backpacks combined, that staff insisted that my friend must pack everything into one backpack only. My friend had to step out, repack everything into one bulging, overflowing backpack before he is let through. The content brought through the gate doesn't change, the two backpacks were far from exceeding the luggage allowance in the first place, and the staff has created nothing more than sheer annoyance and further delay in our already delayed trip. The flight was around 50 minutes long and given the 1-hr time difference, reached London Luton airport at around 10:45pm London time. By this time, my friend and I were very anxious as we need to catch the 11:20pm bus from the airport to the train station, if we miss that bus, we will miss the last train home and will inevitably have to spend the night out in the streets. Just when everyone is getting their luggage from the cabin and gearing to leave, a flight announcement sounded saying that the bus to the gate will not be here for another ten minutes, and we were frustrated. Despite being late for an hour, the shuttle bus to the gate is still not scheduled on time! By the time the shuttle bus came, everyone got in, and we arrived at the gate, it was 11pm and we have barely 20 minutes to run to the customs, clear it, and dash to the bus stop.

Having travelled extensively for over 50 years, never have I experienced such appalling, intimidating and hostile behaviour as displayed by the crew on this flight. From the outset the passengers were threatened by the cabin steward and the intimidating behaviour continued throughout the flight.  Whilst I understand cabin crew do have occasional customer issues & pressures to deal with (as do all other customer facing roles) the majority of yesterday's passengers appeared to be middle aged, sensibly behaved golfers & regular, well mannered holiday makers. We were all initially warned that the crew had a ""list of passenger names"" who'd made purchases from Manchester airport duty-free and if anyone was suspected of drinking their own alcohol they would have their cabin baggage inspected and if found 'guilty' they would have the duty-free confiscated and face the prospect of arrest and a night in jail at their destination. An example was provided involving one recent passenger on a journey to Tenerife, and was conveyed as if this was a threat. One  does not generally get on a plane expecting to be spoken to like unruly school children or out of control persons. As far as I could see, most passengers were opened mouthed in astonishment by the attitude of the crew. The in-flight safety demonstration then commenced, but the steward paused it, and subsequently instructed us that if anyone was found to be not paying full attention to the safety demonstration the plane would be ""returning to the terminal and we'd be going nowhere"". Much as I fully understand the basis and sense behind both the above examples (there were many others) there are ways of politely conveying information to customers. I did not witness one passenger acting in anything but an adult and respectable manner and the behaviour of the crew was at best disrespectful and bombastic. I witnessed one stewardess referring loudly to one gentleman passenger (behind his back) as ""grandad"". Another male steward was openly verbally and sneeringly hostile towards a passenger, there seemed to be other disputes ongoing throughout the journey. When the cabin steward announced that in flight duty-free sales were about to commence we were all warned darkly about the dangers of consuming alcohol or tobacco purchased in Turkey as it could not be trusted and we would have no idea of the dangers of buying it anywhere but on board the flight (hardly conducive towards the currently struggling tourist economy in Turkey). We subsequently did not purchase anything from duty-free in protest to such slanderous remarks, nor did fellow passengers nearby. It was a relief to disembark, in the arrivals hall a large number of passengers were openly discussing how dreadful the crew had been and how unnecessary their hostile attitudes had been. I have never left a complaint on any social networking or internet website before, however on this occasion I feel sufficiently aggrieved to vent my dismay.

We opted for the meal deals, and were really impressed with the Corkers crisps and the hot food. They were far tastier than any other on-flight food I've had in over 10 years of flying with state-owned and low-cost airlines. The staff was very attentive, helping me with my baggage, and making sure that I'm aware of the facilities and safety features dedicated to infants. The flight attendants forgot to serve us some of the food, and it took about 15 minutes for the hot food to be served, but that's not something we'd hold against them, considering they were genuinely busy. There was a general sense of calm and consideration for other people, with passengers willing to overlook the noise and fuss our children made, and I believe that's down to how the staff carried themselves and attended to people's needs. There was a friendly atmoshpere throughout, which helped ease our anxieties over political unrest in the country, and especially attitudes toward migrants. The new Recaro seats are very comfortable and sleek, with plenty of legroom behind and underneath.

Then, we were informed that due to the baggage conveyor going wrong, all the hold bags had to be moved manually so a delay was inevitable. This is when the hard seat with my knees under my chin became an issue. For the 1.5 hour flight I was prepared to suffer but the extra hour made it a bit torturous. Coming back on the 25th, the flight was overbooked and again, people were asked to put luggage in the hold. We kept our cases as I suspect the reclaim at Gatwick would have been a much longer wait than at Montpellier which was very quick. The queuing system at the gate was a bit farcical and disorderly. Because we had no priority boarding, it was difficult to find anywhere for our cases due again, in no uncertain way to the lockers being overstuffed with oversize luggage. The cabin staff were very helpful and fitted our bags in further down the cabin. I felt sorry for the staff having to put up with quite a few unpleasant comments from other travellers.

"""received no apology""",3,2016-01-26,"During my recent flight from Spain, where I live, to Gatwick for the weekend I experienced appalling treatment at the hands of Easyjet staff. As we were about to board the plane we were asked to demonstrate that our bag would fit in the cage. This was an irritating request seeing as we had flown with the bag a dozen times, but nonetheless one I acceded to in good humour, courtesy and without protest. In the interests of saving time I placed the bag in the cage, but did not push it all the way down. The first two wheels glided in seamlessly, but the last two wheels were left protruding out of the cage by about 1 inch, but only as I had not pushed the bag down as it should have been obvious it fitted. The Easyjet employee simply stated ""right, it doesn’t fit it will have to be checked in"". There was no attempt to be helpful and suggest I get the last two wheels in and no application of common sense that dictated that if the first two wheels fitted, then the last two logically also must. It was not said with even a modicum of courtesy and she walked away from me while she was talking. I went back to the desk where she rudely informed me I had to pay £45 for it to be checked in. Understandably shocked and frustrated at my appalling public treatment I refused, to which she replied ""well you won’t be flying then"". I was utterly flabbergasted at how brusquely I was being spoken to. At this point she directed me, again curtly, to her manager. Her manager displayed a similar lack of professionalism and contempt for us, talking to me as though I were an errant child that should have known better. I pointed out that we had flown out on Friday with the bag, to which she responded that she didn’t know if I really did as I may have checked it in, the logical inference being I was lying. I pointed out that she could look up my flight records and see that I had not checked in any luggage, to which she responded that I might have swapped the bag while in the UK over the weekend. The stupidity of this statement needs no explanation. She reiterated that I would not be flying if we refused to pay. I suggested there was an issue with Easyjet staff training seeing as I had flown with the bag a dozen times and never experienced any problems, to which she contemptuously explained to me that her staff were excellently trained in these matters. At this point both my girlfriend and I were exhausted with the ridiculousness of it all. My girlfriend offered to demonstrate to the manager that the bag did fit, which the manager flippantly accepted, clearly certain that her ""well trained"" staff couldn’t possibly have made an error. The bag went all the way into the cage and the manager’s response was simply ""ok, yes it can go in with you"". We received no apology. She simply walked off and carried on with her work. I even had to ask for our passports back. I would also like to point out that on the flight out we were told there was no room in the overhead bins (there was) and we had to check it in. Perhaps I should have charged Easyjet £45 for doing so. Is this really the level of professionalism and customer service I can expect from Easyjet?

easyJet customer review,7,2015-07-28,"Overall a good value for money experience with EasyJet. Was flying from Luton Airport to Nice on a Sunday morning. Upon arrival at the airport, as check in now happens online it was easy to just queue up and drop the bags off at the bag drop desks. Though it's not favourable having so many flights queueing up for around 8 desks the queues were not that bad and the airline were beginning to open more desks. Worst thing about this bag drop system is that those running late don't have an individual desk so have to queue up for a while or use flight closures. The next step of the journey involving the airline was boarding. This happened efficiently and despite the flight being full speedy boarding wasn't needed as overhead locker space was easily avaliable when on board. The cabin crew (4) were helpful, friendly and very presentable. The leg room and seat comfort was as expected. As only a short flight there was no need to purchase any snacks or drinks but as with most airlines items were a touch pricey but there was a decent selection. Our flight was delayed by 40 minutes leaving Luton due to a wait for a take off slot from ATC this delay did seem longer as the aircraft was boarded by 0650 and didn't take off till 0750. Not expected but would of been nice to have screens to follow the route and the captain/first officer gave very little updates. Despite the delay leaving due to a tail wind we did only arrive 15 minutes late. Baggage was delivered in Nice T2 around 15 minutes after disembarking the aircraft which was very speedy. Good experience with EasyJet would advise booking early for cheaper flights but if your able to be flexible that also helps.

Bag drop at Copenhagen T2 was fast, and our carry-on bags inspected for number and size. easyJet use the low-cost terminal F at Copenhagen airport, which is pretty sparten but well lit and clean. Having been marshalled at the gate, (with seating for only 15 people travelling in Plus, and no seating for Economy), it is just a short walk to the aircraft for boarding, which goes smoothly as both front and rear doors are used. In bad weather this exposure could be slightly unpleasant, as bottle-necks would mean waiting on the aircraft steps. However, all is good on board. The cabin is clean and tidy, the flight staff good humoured, and the blessing of a non-reclining seat-back so that the passenger in front of you cannot recline their seat as soon as possible, and perhaps leave it in that position for the whole of the flight –  wonderful.

easyJet customer review,3,2015-07-22,"Flight out (Manchester to Heraklion) was fine, pleasant staff and straight forward. We checked bags and carried hand luggage. Cramped and uncomfortable seating, along with expensive food on board, this unfortunately becoming the norm for this level of airline, so no surprises. Returning (Heraklion to Manchester) however ended with further expense just prior to boarding. We checked the same bag for the hold as before no problem and carried the same bags, but afterwards we received very disorganised information from the easyJet staff at this airport. Waiting to board the plane at the gate we were singled out in the line by an particular easyJet staff member and to some extent made an example off. The issue initially involved my fiancée carrying an over the shoulder purse as this is apparently one extra piece of hand luggage. I myself had a cabin bag that has an additional over shoulder bag that attaches via a zip. Whilst both bags joined wouldn't fit in the individual persons size limit, the detachable bag is very small and although crammed full fits easily under the seat (as it did on the previous flight no problem). So detached now we had one bag, a small over the shoulder bag and my fiancée's purse. Both these two smaller items fitted together in the airlines cabin size limit (plus there was more than enough room left for a person to stand next to them). However this particular easyJet member of staff loudly and publicly stated that we had one too may cabin bags. We tried cramming the smaller purse into the other only to have the complaint that the zips were not fully closed. Stressed and feeling victimised at this point with a particularly unfriendly and inflexible staff member, along with feeling singled out, especially as a number of the other customers now going through the gate for boarding next to us carried multiple duty free bags each far larger than our additional 'bag', we were forced to concede to have the cabin bag placed in the aircraft hold to an additional €55 fee. Great end to a holiday. easyJet for us is not particularly good value for money when you consider the hidden charges (charged to check in online also now I recall), inflexibility and lack of customer service (for at least one particular member of staff).

Outbound - due to the early departure time I stayed at a Gatwick hotel the night before and used easyjet's ""midnight check-in"" which meant the next morning I avoided the queues and went straight to security. I'd paid for a seat up front and had speedy boarding both ways. Despite it being a holiday destination, I didn't find the overheads filling up too much. Very nice crew on both legs. Outbound we were pushed back and told we'd be delayed an hour. Last time I flew this route with easy we were delayed 3 hours. This is crucial to me as I had a ferry to catch once we got to Kefalonia and last time I had to pay €100 for a private water taxi instead. With the delay and the non-reclining seats, my back was beginning to ache, probably not helped sitting next to a wide muscle man. Coming back we had a newer plane with thinner seats and bigger gaps between them. I've had bus seats more comfortable. On the plus side I had 2 seats next to me spare which has been very rare from me. This flight was delayed coming to Kefalonia and landing at Gatwick we were held up for about 20 mins.

Tight squeeze and confusion for many of where to sit and many family members split. This plane was looking it's age inside and rattled a lot. It was one of the spare ones used specifically for breakdowns. Inbound flight: Delayed by 2 hours. Okay this airport has had a fire but please it was a month ago!

There was even a young Easyjet employee who was travelling on an earlier flight (there were several to the UK all delayed) who was as perplexed as we were). At last after further enquiries and looking at the Easyjet website on phones the reason given for the delay was that a technical fault was the excuse. Easyjet are not at fault on the airport issues but I think they could do a lot better. Replacing ageing aircraft is a must and leaving passengers in the dark is inexcusable. Even though the pilot apologized for the delay it's not the delay at all it's the lack of common sense and dialogue that exasperates passengers. I've been in similar positions with other airlines.

Once in the baggage reclaim area there was another slight delay as the conveyor belt would not start. The attitude of some passengers was appalling. The one airport employee present was constantly badgered about what was happening. All he could say was the engineers were trying to fix it and the duty manager was on his way. This evidently was not good enough for some and they registered their displeasure by behaving in a rude and arrogant fashion to both the one employee present and the duty manager when he arrived. The belt started and all luggage was offloaded and collected after about 30minutes not exactly a catastrophe but to some it was as if Easyjet (who were not responsible for any delay) and the Management at Luton Airport had deliberately conspired to cause a problem for their amusement. People should be more tolerant and if time is truly important perhaps allow time for possible or even probable delays.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,8,2015-05-11,LPL-ACE-LPL 3 May-7 May. Both A-320 aircraft's were clean and comfortable crew excellent on both flights. Flights left slightly late but due to tail winds arrived on time into Lanzarote and 20 minutes early into Liverpool. Yet another excellent flight. Easyjet remain our low cost carrier airline of choice.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,10,2015-05-11,Flew from Luton to Naples on 1st May and then returned on 4th May. This review is for the 4th May return journey (10.35 flight). How nice and personable for the captain to greet the passengers in person just before take off. The cabin crew were friendly and professional. Not used to seeing air hosts/esses looking like they actually enjoy their jobs!,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,6,2015-05-10,Flight was delayed a bit from MPL-LGW but the rest of the experience went without indecent. It did however seem that boarding took a bit longer than it should have because of some delay in letting passengers on in addition to the general confusion with so many passengers trying to find space in the overhead compartments. In general though the flight went okay it just seems the inefficiency in their boarding process has consistently added time whenever I have travelled with EasyJet both this time and in the past. I also of course did not like how the seats do not recline but I suppose that's another issue.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,3,,False,
easyJet customer review,10,2015-05-08,LGW-DBV 29/4/15. We had already checked in online so bag drop off was very quick also we had booked emergency exit seats so we had priority boarding which also was spot on. The cabin crew were friendly and professional even taking the time to explain to us how to open the emergency door and if we were ok with this food and beverages also ok. Return flight DBV-LGW 3/5/15 also got priority boarding cabin crew just as good as outbound flight. Both flights on time. This is the first time we have flown with easy jet and will have no hesitation about booking with them again.,False,,,Premium Economy,,,5,5,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,9,2015-05-08,BHX-GVA-BHX. Another great flight with Easyjet. Checked in and printed my boarded passes at home so just had to drop my suitcase at Birmingham which took around 5 minutes. I like that Easyjet now allocate your seats although they still call the flight very early presumably to ensure everyone is at the gate ready for boarding. Our flight departed at 14.55 yet the final call was at 14.15 so there were people hanging around the gate for a while. The flight itself was very smooth with a good selection of food and drinks and we arrived bang on time into GVA. Only gripe is that the in-flight magazine has very little content mostly being adverts and therefore isn't much of a read but for a short flight this isn't really an issue. Baggage was delivered swiftly and I was out of the airport in under 25 minutes. The queues for the bag drop for the return journey were much longer than at BHX I assume that this is because Easyjet only operate three routes from BHX whereas GVA is a hub and therefore there are many more Easyjet flights departing. They utilise the same queue for all flights but if time is tight for a flight they will open a special desk for individual flights. Overall the queue took about 45 minutes to clear which didn't leave any time for shopping as again they put out the final call for the flight a good 40 minutes prior to departure. Return flight was smooth and we landed about 10 minutes ahead of schedule and although the baggage was slower arriving at BHX than GVA I was still out of the airport in under 40 minutes. For the price I paid I cannot complain and I would definitely fly Easyjet again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,6,2015-05-05,BRS-BCN-BRS. Flight out on 18/4/15 was excellent. Took off on time and arrived 20 minutes early. Plane looked to be a new A320 with new thin seats which were surprisingly comfortable and seemed to give plenty of room. Return flight on 2/5/15 was exactly opposite. Probably the most uncomfortable easyjet flight we've ever had (A319). Had seats 20 E & F which were extremely cramped. Luckily the flight left almost on time but with an extended flight time due to head winds it was the best part of two hours of purgatory. This won't stop us using easyjet but we'll make sure we don't have these seats again. Staff on both flights were efficient rather than friendly but you don't expect them to be your new best friends.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,3,,True,
easyJet customer review,6,2015-04-30,Flew with my mother from Bristol to Reykjavik on flight EZY6001 on Sunday 5th April. Our first time travelling with EasyJet. We had a slight confusion with a staff member at the baggage drop as after he'd weighed and labelled my case I mentioned that the case was my hand luggage but he didn't understand what I meant! Eventually the problem was sorted out but the confusion could have been avoided if there were signs up at both Bristol and Reykjavik airports telling people with just hand luggage that they don't need to go to baggage drop but can proceed to wherever the next step is. Staff on the outward flight were very polite friendly and helpful but the staff on the return flight (EZY6002 on Thursday 9th April) seemed eager to get the journey over and done with and reluctant to go the extra mile for the passengers. Sandwiches were also sold out by the time the staff came round asking people if they'd like anything to eat and drink. Refreshments expensive especially crisps and chocolate but the bacon baguette I had on the outward flight was tasty! Overall the flights weren't as bad as I'd feared from their reputation and I would probably fly EasyJet again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,3,,True,
easyJet customer review,10,2015-04-30,Southend to Amsterdam return day trip on 28th April. Quick security check and a nice cooked breakfast at Southend. Outbound flight at 07.25 was just 45 minutes and inbound flight at 21.45 was just 40 minutes. Took off from Amsterdam about 15 minutes late but managed to make up lost time and landed back at Southend 5 minutes early. Cabin crew on both flights were friendly professional and efficient. Didn't bother buying any snacks or drinks as it was just a quick hop. Overall another brilliant experience with Easyjet and would fly with them and from Southend again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,

From online check in to bag drop to boarding and on board service the staff were charming and smiling. It has come a long way indeed even the uniforms look professional. Obviously they are doing something right and keeping prices low cost! Every flight was on time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,10,2015-04-24,19th April Manchester to Geneva and returned Monday Geneva to Manchester Flights 1949 and 1952. Booking was easy to do and very clear on the website.

easyJet customer review,6,2015-04-24,Flight 2603 8/4/15. The plane and seats were clean and the cabin crew were very helpful and attentive but the ground staff at Milan airport were bad and very disorganised. We started to board and wait in the queue for the bus to take us to the plane instead of having the bus ready we waited in the lines for 30 mins while they organised buses. Why board guests when the bus is not ready is beyond me.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,4,,False,
easyJet customer review,1,2015-04-20,EDI-CDG. Booking the flight online with Easyjet was simple and quick. The experience at the airport was busy and chaotic and ground staff were miserable looking and abrupt with some passengers. Flights on both routes was on time which was good but the cabin staff were poor in their duties and also miserable looking and not very welcoming. I would not use this airline again and would rather pay more for a better experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,2,,False,
easyJet customer review,10,2015-04-19,ATH-MAN 8th April. No queue at bag drop off and boarded on time although we had a 1 hour delay due to air traffic control strike.

No complaints at all.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,10,2015-04-19,MAN-ATH 17th April. Flight left and arrived on time. As on the outbound flight the plane was clean and well maintained.

easyJet customer review,5,2015-04-16,We had a trip back from Chania on 14th April 2015 we travel there many times a year when we left this time it felt like they were on the move to make more money at any cost. We had 20.7 and 20.9 kgs in our 2 suitcases and no hand luggage they insisted on charging us an extra 2 kgs for the extra weight at a cost of 26 euros we had no other bags to transfer anything into so we had to pay it. It is a con and made us very upset and ruined our trip back. Beware people easyjet is charging more and more yet show it costs less and less.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,3,,False,

easyJet customer review,6,2015-04-12,"Went SCQ-LGW flight overall was good although it was a little frustrating about their one hand bag rule. Usually I just have a carry-on sized suitcase and my handbag which is about the same size as a purse. Although they said that I would need to put my handbag into my suitcase because ""only one piece is allowed"" but this woman in front of me had several bags from duty free shops which were quite a bit larger than my handbag yet they said nothing about them to her. Additionally I'm not sure if the seats were not meant to recline or I just couldn't find the switch but I ended up not being able to recline the seat on the flight which was fine for a short flight but for further destinations I think this probably wouldn't be comfortable.",False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,3,,False,
easyJet customer review,2,2015-04-12,EZY5455 from Gatwick to Paphos Cyprus. I would rather fly in a coffin seats might be ok for short flights of say up to 2 hours but trust me when they rush you on a delayed departure flight already knowing your going to be delayed further due to military manoeuvres around Cyprus air space. Hurry rush sit down belt up. Oh this is your captain speaking we've just been informed our departure is going to be delayed by about 1 hour. Due to military manoeuvres over Cyprus airspace. So sat their we did in cramped conditions for an hour. Another 4 hours until we got to Paphos airport and finally released from the cramped conditions. Still got this to look forward to Saturday night.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,2,,False,
easyJet customer review,9,2015-04-12,U2 1887 Manchester to Munich. Flight left on time despite French ATC strike. I am 183cm and found the seat pitch fine.

That said easyjet offer great value for money.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,6,2015-04-04,Went from LGW-BCN so not so not such a long flight.

easyJet customer review,9,2015-03-26,I've flown with easyJet a handful of times from London Gatwick to various European cities and my experience has always been pleasant. I've been lucky with delays (or lack of) and have always found staff polite and helpful. I think one must remember that this is not Emirates so your expectation of customer experience should not be as high a standard.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,7,2015-03-23,Outward bound was Gatwick to Agadir. It was a traditional 'sardine tin' flight with no leg room and the aisle armrest didn't go up so it was very difficult getting in and out without holding the headrest of the seat in front where a poor young man attempting to sleep was continuously disturbed by me getting up and down as we had a baby with us who wouldn't sit still and it was a 7 30am flight. However the return journey was a total surprise we were on a newer plane with lots of leg room the aisle arm rest went up so we had lots of space and I didn't need to hold onto anything to get in and out of my seat. The seats were a lot thinner but surprisingly more comfortable than the previous thicker seats. On both journeys the planes were on time the staff were friendly- more on the outward flight 2 of the flight attendants on the way back obviously had lost the ability to smile so overall my first experience with easy jet was a positive one and I would definitely use them again. My trip satisfaction would have been a 9 if we had flown both ways on the more comfortable plane and the 2 flight attendants had actually smiled just once!,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,8,2015-03-20,Flew LTN-ALC return. Flight out was on a new easyJet A320 including the airlines new seats which were quite comfortable and have much more room. The flight was on time and cabin crew on board were friendly and professional. Only downside is how busy Luton Airport is in the morning meaning we just got to the gate in time even getting to the airport 2 hours before! The return flight was on a slightly more cramped A319 with the old style seating. Again flight was on-time and cabin crew were again friendly and professional. Overall a good experience with easyJet.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,10,2015-03-17,LPL-FUE 28/2/15. As a regular Ryanair passenger I was looking forward to comparing but to be honest I found no difference except crew slightly smarter uniforms. Flights on time seats comfy enough price great.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,,2015-03-09,Appalled by delayed flight from Amsterdam. Two hour delay resulting in landing at Gatwick with no way of getting home because the landing was so late there were no longer any trains from the airport for my destination. Had to find emergency accommodation and pay a fortune in getting there by taxi. I recommend you never book the last flight with this company you will be severely delayed. Other regular flyers confirmed this to be the case. The flight was due to leave at 21.25 actually boarded at 23.21 - funnily enough just within the two hour deadline for claiming compensation. No full explanation on their website and I'm afraid the old excuse 'technical issues' just doesn't wash when you overhear other airline staff mention the fact there weren't enough planes to fulfil the bookings promised! By all means fly with easyJet but just do not book the last flight especially on very short flights.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,3,,False,
easyJet customer review,8,2015-03-09,Outbound 27 February Gatwick to Luxembourg. online check-in with hand baggage and speedy boarding. All worked well with the exception of speedy boarding at the departure gate. Speedy boarding in same queue as general passengers so in my view was not worth the extra. Inflight seats and beverages fine crew excellent. Flight departed on time and arrived early. Inbound 1 March Luxembourg to Gatwick. Online check-in with hand baggage and speedy boarding. Arrived at departure gate and as flight full case into hold. Speedy boarding as waste of time in my view here as all in one queue. Otherwise an uneventful flight arrived on time excellent crew once again. Hold baggage on belt on arrival. First ever time with Easyjet and would definitely use again where price timings etc work. Would have to rethink the sporting boarding at overseas airports.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,8,2015-03-09,Stansted to Palma 21st Feb returning 28th Feb. Bag drop at Stansted was very quick and not much slower at Palma where we were offered a 'free' second hold baggage item. I suspect they knew cabin storage would be at a premium with a full flight. Both flights to time and smooth-especially the landings where touchdown was almost unnoticeable. All in all a pretty good experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,,2015-03-09,LIS-FNC another domestic flight with easyjet but this time I didn't catch it after all and in part due to the fact that easyjet now decides to slightly anticipate their take offs without notice. The plane was right in front of the gate they just had to open it and I would walk to the plane which had its doors still open and the ground support equipment also functional. Would it hurt that much? Had then to change flights to the other day paid 160 EUR more for 2 passengers and they weren't even able to give me a receipt with theirs and mine fiscal number I could only have it asking through the internet but it's actually impossible if you don't ask for it prior and through the process of booking. I think they try to skip their tax law obligations in the countries they operate.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,4,,,1,,False,
easyJet customer review,4,2015-02-24,LIS-FNC. Delayed by 30 minutes due to what seems a terrible lack of organization at easyjet's hub in Lisbon's airport terminal 2. There were 3 flights of easyjet leaving all at the same time. This terminal consists in a suffocating atmosphere with considerably bad infrastructure and used only for departures of low cost airlines. I was assigned a seat at the last row of the plane and not only there wasn't no window - in what it seems a business measure to book the more possible passengers at the expense of the seat pitch - but the plane itself was a really old A319 very degraded but the worst was the total lack of cleaning on the plane the seats textiles had a vivid brown in an absolutely act of negligence. The Portuguese male flight attendants chat a lot between both of them loud and clear as if the passengers were interested in knowing about their lives. Easyjet tends to be an excellent alternative choice but this time failed low of expectations. And please stop selling cameras among others throughout the flight. It seems like a bazaar not a plane.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,3,,True,
easyJet customer review,,2015-02-24,Low cost seems to equal non existent customer service from Easyjet. Long queues at 'bag drop' worse than other airlines 'checkins' plus long queues at security = missed flight even arriving 2 hours before 'checked-in' flight. £65 per person to rebook on a later flight not what you want on a 3 day trip to Amsterdam. Easyjet don't want to know - never flying with them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,2,,False,
easyJet customer review,4,2015-02-24,Recently flew LGW to MXP and return over the half term break. Inflight the service was fine. Delayed significantly by weather on the way out but that can happen. What was shocking however was check in at LGW. Yes I know it was half term but it took 90 minutes to do a bag drop simply because their process with very few check in staff saw constant delays as those turning up late for other flights were whisked to the front of the queue. So if you want to avoid a queue arrive late if you like queuing arrive 2-3 hours early. Just ridiculous!,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,3,,False,

easyJet customer review,5,2015-01-14,Overall good flight to and from Marrakech. Not sure what the point of the baggage drop is when you have to join an endless queue with people arguing about seats and luggage. The check in at Marrakech airport was farcical. We joined a queue with 4 families ahead of us. There was already a woman at the counter who kept arguing with the counter staff for over half an hour. The checking clerk kept disappearing and nothing appeared to be resolved. Then a single-man checked in quickly. He was followed by a large family group who appeared to be completely unable to fill in there own exit cards. The check clerk proceeded to fill in each form for them taking over half an hour! The family then proceeded to tag each piece of luggage with security strips. Our conclusion is you need to arrive 3 hours before the flight in order check in. We were most disappointed.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,1,2015-01-14,We travelled from Marrakech to Gatwick on Sunday 4th January. Our flight was delayed through no fault of the airline and the staff were efficient and friendly. The problems began when we arrived at Gatwick. Easyjet employ Menzies to handle their baggage transportation. We waited 90 minutes for our luggage to arrive. The staff had no information and simply said it was because our flight was delayed but other flights that arrived after ours got their luggage before us. The Duty. Manager refused to take calls from his own staff. Appalling service. Whilst Easyjet continue to employ such a useless and inefficient company to handle their baggage needs we will not be flying Easyjet again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,1,,False,

easyJet customer review,,2015-01-14,"Travelled Arrecife to Liverpool 8th January having had a great flight outbound some days earlier ex Manchester with Monarch. The contrast could not be more stark. Boarding passes indicated a boarding time of 18.05 for a 18.35 departure. Approximately an hour before the due time boarding was announced which came as a surprise. An entire planeload of passengers were then processed through the boarding gate only to be left standing in an unlit hot covered walkway for just short of 30 minutes. Whilst my husband and I are able bodied there were any number of elderly passengers and very young children amongst our number who quickly became tired. This was an unpleasant experience but we were staggered to learn from regular passengers on this flight that this is standard prior to departure. From the moment the cabin doors closed pretty much until the wheels touched the tarmac in Liverpool 4 hours 15 minutes later those of us in the rear rows of seats were subjected to an absolute barrage of noise from the staff in the rear galley. During a long evening flight it clearly never occurred to them at any point that their passengers may wish to have some peace in which to rest read or sleep. Even the ""trolley service"" was conducted in between their gripping chats on many occasions causing them to have to ask passengers to repeat their orders as they clearly hadn't listened to them in the first place. We were both glad to finally exit the aircraft and both agreed on walking across the tarmac in highs wind and rain that we would not have had much confidence in this cabin crew to competently handle anything outside gossip and moaning.

easyJet customer review,4,2015-01-05,EasyJet seem to be having a few organisational problems recently. We had a few friends telling us about delays problems getting into the plane and lack of information. We've always been happy with the service travelling with our family but have been disappointed by our last trip from Barcelona to London Gatwick. Our flight was scheduled at 7.30 pm. We had not luggage so arrived at the airport at 6pm. No information on the gate was available - we then learned that the flight was delayed by one hour. No one on the ground had information to give us. Delayed by another hour. We finally get to Gatwick and we were delayed again because there were no ground staff.

easyJet customer review,,2014-12-22,Booked a one day return flight Amsterdam-Gatwick v.v. to attend a funeral on December 12. Whilst in the UK we heard of the computer problems at NATS but were relieved to hear on the way to the airport that problems were solved. Arriving there 3.5 hours before the flight was due we decided to have something to eat. Then a got a message on my iphone: we are very sorry but your flight EZ 8883 has been cancelled. Please contact Easyjet.com etc. This prompted us to go to the Easyjet desk but unfortunately there were already some 200 people before us in long rows with only 2 easyjet employees to assist. Therefore I (fortunately) decided to change my booking online and managed to get a return flight the following day in the evening. Then after 1.5 hours an easyjet employee climbed on a stand and shouted that everybody should see to changing their booking themselves and that accommodation to spend the night had been arranged at the Hilton Hotel. Upon arrival there Hilton knew nothing and was full to the brim. So back to the Easyjet desk only to find out that there were no more rooms but also no more Easyjet employees! Fortunately we managed to find some spare bedrooms in the Block hotel at Gatwick. Even getting a boarding pass proved to be a problem: as I had changed my booking using my iphone I was of course unable to print my boarding pass. So we went to Easyjet in the south terminal and asked them to print the boarding pass. That was not possible we had to go to the North terminal as we would leave from there. After some talking the man behind the desk told us check in was not open yet but after we told him we had already checked in electronically he managed to come up with two traditional boarding passes.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,2,,False,

easyJet customer review,,2014-12-22,My gripe is over a flight from Verona to LGW - problems were caused by Italian strikes and on checking in at the airport we were informed that an 11.45 flight had been delayed to 19.15 - not only informed by the check-in lady she also wrote it on our boarding pass and it was showing on the airport screens. She also told us to return to the airport at 1800 hours. We said to the very nice lady (who disappeared about five times as they were obviously being briefed on what to do) that we were going back into town for the day which we did. Due to the delay and a 3 hour drive on return we were looking at booking a hotel for the night at Gatwick but just to check whether we were being told the truth about the 19.15 departure time I decided to check when the rescheduled outward flight was going to leave LGW on the easyjet flight scanner - because it was actually in the air and on further inspection our flight had been rescheduled back to 1250pm - showing on both easyjet and airport websites. Jump into taxi and return to airport. Easyjet (and their agents) must have known at the time we were dropping our bags that the outward flight was actually happening as the plane must have been loaded and on the taxiway at LGW. Also easyjet made no attempt to communicate with us by email or mobile phone. Talking to others on the flight they had been asked at check-in to leave contact details and had been phoned (one family from about 40 miles away had got back home and had to turn around again almost immediately). We were incredibly lucky not to miss the flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,,,5,,False,
easyJet customer review,7,2014-12-18,London Gatwick to Arrecife. Long queue at North Terminal on arrival Friday lunchtime but moved very quickly. The return was on the delayed EZY8682 on 29 November due to bad weather locally. The captain made announcements updating us while the cabin crew distributed water and did their best to look after the passengers. Having announced that we might be going to Portugal initially we did fly straight to London once we were able to leave.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,5,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,3,2014-12-10,Geneva to Gatwick with Easyjet in September - yet more delays. Our flight was delayed by seven hours or more and though we took an option to travel to Luton we were still over five hours late. No refund for delay costs they said as we chose a different routing we were no longer entitled. Yet I asked at the desk at the time if it would affect any claim they said no. Customer service when you need it is non existent. All those hours in Geneva were rewarded with a voucher for supper 15 swiss francs. You will probably guess what that buys you in Geneva airport.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,3,,False,

easyJet customer review,1,2014-11-25,I recently booked a trip from London to Jersey for 4 people on easyjet which was a complete mess. One of the passengers arrived separately from the rest of us. He processed to easyjet check-in desk to get a boarding pass and was given the wrong boarding pass by the staff member. He never checked the boarding pass and managed to clear security at the airport with it. When the remanding 3 passengers tried to clear security with our boarding pass this was then it was discovered that the boarding passes were mixed up. This took sometime to be resolved but eventually did. As it was nearly time for our flight to leave we hurried to the gate only to find that is was already closed. At no point during this period did easyjet page us to advise that the gate was closing or that it was the last call for us (the passengers). We had to go back to easyjets desk in the departure area and waited over 45 minutes before someone came to the desk to see us. We had the use the phone on the desk to call an easyjet staff member 7 times before someone arrived. When someone did arrive the matter was not handled with any urgency. We were taken back to customer service desk and were told that it is our responsibility to get to the get to the gate on time. In order to change the ticket we would need to pay. We advised them of the error made my easyjet staff of giving the wrong boarding pass to the wrong passenger. We also asked why we were not paged and was told that easyjet doesn't page customers. They will only do so if you have checked in a bag. We did not check in any bags as we were only going to jersey for a day. I told the agent it was discrimination as easyjet assumes that all passengers are literate. Also it is common practice for airlines to page passengers if they have checked in and not arrived at the gate. We were offered the next easyjet flight which was in the afternoon at nearly 4pm which meant our day trip would not happen. Tried phoning customer service and we were meet with the same no help attitude. In the end we when to jersy and was only able to spend 2 hours. A very unsatisfactory trip. Since then trying to get customer service to take some action has been terrible.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,,1,,False,
easyJet customer review,10,2014-11-17,Never flown with easyJet before and feared the worst. But despite a bit of a jam when boarding I was impressed. Aircraft was clean and fairly new. In flight service was quick and friendly and the Captain kept us well informed regarding the progress of the flight both ways and expected ETA. On the whole for a budget airline (or any airline for that matter) a good experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,

Whole package booked through Easyjet online really easy to navigate check in at Manchester a breeze and through to departures within 10-15 minutes. Onboard very new A320 with new seats plenty of space and immaculate. Crew friendly and provided efficient service return flight just as good again excellent crew very friendly and landed 10 minutes early - will recommend Easyjet to friends and family and will book and fly again with Easyjet.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,5,2014-11-12,VRN-LGW. No frills airline where I even need to pay for water. Verona airport has nothing to do but I can't blame the airline the boarding process involved having to push our way through people who did not purchase priority boarding and standing in buses that had their doors open in the summer heat. Aside from that nothing else to report. I would have flown BA if I could to LGW since the value I think is better.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,5,,,4,,False,
easyJet customer review,2,2014-11-12,Friday night flight from Glasgow to London Gatwick. We arrived at 18.00 for the flight as we had to drive in from northern Scotland. Flight was supposed to depart at 21.20 and land at 22.45 after which we would get some sleep in a hotel and fly out to Tenerife at 05.50 the next morning. At check-in we were advised of a delay of 1 hour 38 minutes with no explanation but the agent told us to keep watching the board as easyJet would try to push the flight forward. The opposite happened. Our scheduled departure time went past 23.00 00.00 and 01.00. Eventually a fellow passenger told us that refreshment vouchers were being handed out at the gate but no announcements were being made to that effect. Staff at the airport were visibly annoyed at the situation. There were no easyJet representatives to speak to only gate staff. When they finally did appear they told us that the delay to the inbound flight was due to severe thunderstorms in Gatwick earlier on in the day but every flight before and after it had already left Gatwick so clearly something else was wrong. They eventually told us that the aircraft was now fully boarded in Gatwick and was awaiting one more crew member they would inform us of its departure. The aircraft landed at 01.50 and we were called forward for boarding immediately leaving us standing for 10 minutes - not what we wanted having been awake since 05.00 the previous morning. Boarded just after 02.00 and took off at 02.25. The captain explained that the delay was due to thunderstorms but in addition the aircraft had technical problems forcing a replacement aircraft to be found and a new crew also had to be sourced. We were in the last row of the aircraft which had no window and was cramped due to the tapering in of the fuselage at the rear. This in addition to the annoying racket the cabin crew were making in the galley made sleep almost impossible. It was 03.45 by the time we disembarked in Gatwick check in for our next flight was already open. To our horror the aircraft parked at the South terminal (replacement aircraft had next flight from there) meaning that passengers and baggage had to be taken over to the North terminal where the flight was destined. Fortunately baggage arrived quickly which was a huge relief because we had to change back to the South terminal in time for our next flight where we finally arrived absolutely exhausted at 04.15. To top it all off easyJet sent us an email saying that the delay was due to adverse weather alone and so we are not entitled to compensation.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,,,2,,False,

easyJet customer review,7,2014-11-06,Gatwick to Bari and back. Ground staff at Gatwick seem to take a delight in the one bag rule. Both crews very pleasant as usual. Boarding at Bari a shambles. Ushered through to the bridge but then waited 15 minutes on staircase as they won't pay to use the full bridge service. Arrived a bit late at Gatwick but to South Terminal. Fine for me as I was alone and catching the train but a real pain for anyone expecting to be met at the North Terminal. And not a word from the cabin crew and no ground crew to offer any apology or explanation. Not good enough. And when comparing prices worth noting that the drinks and snacks I had free on BA the week before would have cost £13 on Easyjet.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,8,2014-10-28,Have travelled several times with easyJet and continue to be very satisfied with the service provided. Crews work hard are helpful and informative and we never feel hassled. Particularly worthy of mention is the assistance my wife received on our recent flight to Malaga - she thought she had mislaid her passport when she reached passport control and rushed back to the plane before boarding began for its return journey. The crew were both sympathetic and helpful especially the Spanish boarding agent. When they couldn't find it she knew it had to be on her person somewhere and it was. The only niggles that I have relate to the seats on their newer aircraft and the way in which they release their future flight schedules. We came back from Mallorca in September on a new A320 with slimline seats which lack the padding and comfort of the older style ones. As for the flight schedules separate releases for Spring early Summer late Summer have resulted in us twice settling for flights in 2015 with Ryanair instead of waiting for easyJet to release its next tranche. We would find it much more convenient if the whole of the Spring and Summer flights were published at the same time and easyJet would be less likely to lose our custom.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,,,4,,True,

easyJet customer review,10,2014-10-22,LGW-PFO return. Aircraft clean and tidy with helpful cabin crew auxiliary engine was u/s so aircraft cabin very warm. Captain came into main cabin and explained we would need tender assistance to power up engines. He was not only very informative but highly entertaining taking any pressure off the cabin crew due to circumstances. Although late in departure we arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule. Return flight also excellent with a good crew but information in main lounge was poor regarding gate and boarding. Without doubt the 'new' arrangements regarding allocated seating has made the experience that more civilised when boarding. My only issue is the poor choice of food on board and the exorbitant prices for tea and coffee. That aside easyjet really are ahead of other short haul airlines.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,9,2014-10-22,As an easyJet virgin was somewhat apprehensive. Needn't have worried! Apart from a less than smiling reception at the outward bag drop found the whole experience pleasant with very professional cabin crews (infinitely better than the Virgin Atlantic crew experienced on a long haul to Delhi). Inflight prices somewhat expensive but could have been much worse considering we were captive customers. Only one real concern and that was the lack of padding in the seats and consequent bum numbing - glad it was short haul! However overall would certainly travel easyJet again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,5,,,5,,True,

easyJet customer review,4,2014-10-12,We flew from London Gatwick airport to Antalya Turkey in September 2014. What a mess! When we arrived at the bag drop there were two long queues moving rather slowly. EasyJet staff was running madly around the queues calling out for the passengers of the flights that are about to depart. These passengers (us among them) were then moved from inside the general queues to the fast track queue. The bag drop person informed us that the flight was delayed by 1 hour (this information never appeared on the airport display). We figured we had enough time to have a quick lunch. While waiting for our food I went to the information booth to double-check where the lady told me that our flight is not really being delayed all that much maybe by 1/2 hour or less - still no update on any of the airport displays. We quickly bagged our lunch and rushed to the gate. There was still no plane at the gate. Eventually it arrived late (the airport display still had the original departure time no update) and the boarding began. What a mess! After the initial boarding call for privileged EasyJet loyalty program members general boarding call was announced without any regard to the row numbers (i.e. everyone entered in random order) - but the airplane door was closed for some reason so after standing for a while in the line many people went back to the waiting area. Finally the door was open and everyone went inside the plane. Because the boarding order was not related in any way to the location of the people inside the aircraft (normally the rear rows board first to avoid congestion) chaos inside the aircraft followed and the boarding itself took a long time. The flight itself was uneventful no problems upon arrival luggage was offloaded quickly. If this airline can introduce some order into its operational activities I will be happy to use its services again. Also our flight may have been an exception - I do realize that one should not generalize based on a single flight experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,4,,False,
easyJet customer review,9,2014-10-12,Flew LGW to Agadir and returned Marrakech to LGW. Had not used them for a few year. Seat allocation makes the difference.

easyJet customer review,,2014-10-12,For Schiphol airport (Amsterdam) only. Schiphol is a great airport and it use to be great for EasyJet as well. However EasyJet has recently blocked its gates off from the main departures terminal so you have no access whatsoever to any restaurants shops or lounges. This is a real killer as their concourses have little to nothing to offer including seating. Basically is was enough to convince me to stop flying EasyJet from Amsterdam. I would recommend that everyone else gives this EasyJet departure point a miss as well.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,2,,False,

Outbound very smooth and on time gate agent checked I had the right visa papers before boarding. Crew pleasant and informed on routing which I enjoy. Return slightly less easy 45 minute delay incurred by problematic engine starting system. Again crew ensured there were no worries and that we were comfortable. Pleased to see ground staff in Russia spoke English. I must admit I'm not a fan of this allocated seating policy - I'd rather queue up and bag myself a window seat for no extra cost - but it's a very minor inconvenience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,5,,True,

easyJet customer review,,2014-10-05,It was my first time using this airline and I will never use them again. I bought the ticket from Rome to Nice on February 2014 for the flight on 11 September 2014. In March I received notice from them that their daily flight from Rome to Nice would change from 11.55 AM to 7.15pm. I had to change my own schedule because I know what kind of headache I would get trying to get a refund from them. On the day of the flight I found out that there's no use of printing your own boarding pass beforehand because there's still a long line at the check in desks. There's no separate lines for bag-drop. After dropping my baggage I was told that the flight will be delayed for 40-minutes. Then during boarding the crew told me that I couldn't bring my hand bag because I already had a back pack with me. I had to drop one or pay 55EUR. I offered 70EUR cash but was told they only accepted credit card. I will never use this airline again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,1,,False,

easyJet customer review,2,2014-10-01,Flew Southend to Faro 19 September 2014. It seems that Easyjet have now employed the Gestapo that Ryanair used to employ to monitor cabin luggage. The Southend boarding staff are rude. My wife and I both had small cabin luggage and straw hats in separate plastic bags. Yes I know Easyjet have a one bag policy which we knew about before we flew but please tell me why Easyjet requires customers to take the hat out of a see-through bag and put it on rather than employ common sense. I suppose we must wait for Easyjet to adopt the same cabin baggage policy that Ryanair has been forced to adopt (ie. you are allowed a personal item). Previously we have ranked Easyjet higher than Ryanair. After two recent flights with Ryanair over the last couple of months I think we will now stick with Ryanair and avoid Easyjet. Thankfully Easyjet staff at Faro do not apply Easyjet's ridiculous rules.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,2,,False,

easyJet customer review,8,2014-09-28,Flight from London Gatwick to Venice. Flight on time both on takeoff and landing. The crew were good cheerful and friendly. On a short flight they managed to serve food and also interact with passengers. The one thing to prevent giving a score of 10 for satisfaction was the cleanliness of the cabin.

I hope Easyjet will refurbish these old planes because the rest of their service is excellent.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,1,2014-09-28,A first and last time flight experience. Flight from Gatwick to Prague in late August. We followed the rules about bag dimensions and weights and checked in 1 bag each and proceeded to the holding area. Finally a call that our flight was boarding and an extended stampede of passengers to Gate 25 only to find we were further held before boarding. Here we were met with a very unfriendly ground staff member telling us that we were only allowed 1 bag not 2 as we were carrying (1 x wheelie + 1 x accessories). Having checked with the EZ web site just 10 days earlier which clearly indicates that a conforming carry on bag and an additional accessories bag was acceptable my wife and I found ourselves along with plenty of other passengers in a difficult space trying to squeeze our accessories bags into a single carry on. Having got into the plane that was about 2/3 full the PA system was telling us that small bags should be stowed under the seats in front of us. Clearly the people at EZ have no idea about presenting a uniform message. In my case 3 different messages. Does the left hand really know what the right hand is doing? A further delay occurred when the ground staff wouldn't issue a receipt for GBP 45 for an unfortunate passenger who couldn't squeeze 2 into 1 and it had to go in the hold. Rightly she refused to board the plane until a receipt was provided which saw us with a departure delay of around 30 minutes. The aircrew seemed more interested in themselves than providing a customer focused service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,,,2,,False,

Boarding went normal on a cloudy/rainy day in Lisbon. Both cockpit/cabin crew were professional and friendly specially on the return flight from Madeira - Lisbon (September 18th flight) EZY7608). Both flights were smooth despite the poor weather conditions. The only exception was the 40 minutes delay in Funchal but it was due to air traffic control restrictions it wasn't easyjet fault.

Made my case fuller than it had previously been but rules I suppose are rules despite that the seem to be different at each airport. Imagine my surprise then when the tannoy informed me that apart from my hand luggage I was permitted one bag of shopping! I wonder what would have happened had I put my handbag into the carrier bag.

At LGW the gate was only announced at 16.50 with the notice that the gate would close at 16.56 which made for a hasty trek across the famous bridge to the gate where speedy boarding had just been completed.

easyJet customer review,2,2014-09-14,I travelled Prague to Rome. I checked one backpack into the hold. I was carrying a small backpack which weighed about six kilos. I had a small bumbag around my waist which contained my valuables. I was told by this arrogant rude tall staff member to place my small bumbag into my backpack as he deemed it to be an extra bag. I have been travelling for 40 years and never come across this pedantic ridiculous rule. There were passengers there with three times the amount of my land luggage and many of them had their valuables in bags around their necks as well as their hand luggage. We also had to pay extra money from Split to Rome for hold luggage because it didn't come up on the Easyjet software app and it cost us more money at the airport. I won't be flying Easyjet anymore.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,3,,False,
easyJet customer review,9,2014-09-09,On-time departure as seems to be keenly adhered on any flights I've taken with easyjet. Informative flight deck and friendly cabin crew who for not one moment do I think want be be greeting every single passenger onboard but they do it and it's invaluable in my opinion leading to positive customer perception. Naturally being an airline of it's type anything you want onboard bar the toilet is chargable. Not a problem as what's on offer is priced reasonably the selection being good and if it's hot food you're purchasing it comes to you hot not lukewarm. Cabin crew seem to be far more visible during the flight than on some airlines which is undoubtedly a positive. Whilst no one expects them trolling the aisles for the who flight it is great to see them other than during cabin preparation and service times. Definitely an airline I'd have no hesitation in recommending. Comfortable on time flight priced competitively clean and comfortable cabin. Wishful thinking would have me hope some of the national airlines would embrace some of easyjets best practices but that will never happen so easyjet where practicable and price dependant would always be my first choice.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,

Flight was full during boarding there was this rude ground staff. She forced everyone to cut down their baggage to one piece per person.

easyJet customer review,9,2014-08-28,Recently took 4 Easyjet flights: GVA-LGW-DME-LGW-GVA. Maybe I was lucky but everything worked out very well. Of all the flights only the first segment GVA-LGW was late about 40 minutes but I'd planned an overnight stay before the 07:00 flight the next morning. I booked exit-row seats for the two long flights to and from DME and on my return leg had the whole exit row to myself so I lay down and even managed to sleep. I found the FAs friendly and helpful the on-board food is fine with me though some healthy options would be nice.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,10,2014-08-26,I flew on the 12th from Luton to Palma and return on the 19th. I admit I was slightly worried after reading some of the reviews on here but I was pleasantly surprised. Checked in online however this doesn't save time as you still have to join a long line of people waiting to drop their bags off. This wasn't much of an issue as it was only about 10 minutes but I didn't see the point of checking in ourselves. The aircraft was clean and tidy and the seats were comfortable enough for just over 2 hours. We were late taking off by 5 minutes which doesn't matter as we made up the time. The food on board was nice and not too expensive for airline food. Cabin crew were lovely and professional and captain was very informative. I thought this flight was better than the Thomson flight I took 6 months ago which was double the price!,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,4,2014-08-20,EZY5336 17th July 2014. On the plus side Easyjet are pretty punctual but two issues made recent trips just too irritating. Firstly the baggage drop at Gatwick is woeful. You really should not need to arrive 2.5 hrs before departure and queue for an hour or so just because EZ can't be bothered to have all the desks open (or rent some more). Staff shout out destinations so those about to miss their flight can go to the front of the queue. Perhaps it's better not to arrive too early and just wait for the 'late shout' - it's probably quicker! It's not as if EZ don't know how many customers are due to arrive each day so they really should plan things better. The 2nd irritation is being called to 'board' when at the gate. This isn't really boarding at all because typically you just show your boarding card and passport and enter a holding pen (eg Toulouse) and wait there sometimes for 20 minutes or so. Again it's for Easyjet's convenience/saving not the customers'. Why call family groups first so > they can stand for longer rather than call them last? Sometimes Easyjet can be good value but often they are about the same price as flag carriers but the service remains very budget airline. For me I'd pay a small premium for a decent airline. But if you don't mind queues shouty staff and noisy sales announcements on board they're OK. Better than Ryanair though.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,,,3,,False,
easyJet customer review,3,2014-08-18,LGW to Nantes. They say you get what you pay for but this was more expensive than the scheduled flight from London City. I fly multiple times/year normally long haul and I have never seen such rude uncaring staff as the ground staff at LGW. As commented upon by another reviewer silly me for checking in a bag as this then meant that I was told to stow my laptop under my seat as the overhead bins were for those with trolley bags. Check-in was a scrum added to by having to climb over those whose bags were overweight by a couple of paperbacks and were forced to re- pack their suitcases. Never again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,2,,False,
easyJet customer review,,2014-08-18,GVA-VCE GVA-LUT LUT-GVA GVA-ORY ORY-GVA. A terrible airline usually late has own rules which it does not follow poor security poorly trained staff at gate and on plane. The only reason to fly Easyjet used to be the price but with the delays and increased baggage costs you need to add about 50% to fare to compare.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,2,,False,
easyJet customer review,10,2014-08-18,Within the last 2 months I have travelled with Easyjet 6 times all Glasgow to Bristol return. Flights were always on time onboard staff friendly and not over pushy with onboard sales. Overall a very pleasant experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,,2014-08-18,Flight with family Rome to Basel. At boarding no information of which gate to take. Waited for 2 hours until we were brought to aircraft. In front of aircraft bus turned around and brought us back to gate. No information why. After 4 hours we were told we might get a flight at 10 pm (instead of 1 pm) to Geneva then Bus to Basel - at 3 am in the morning when the airport was closed! They promised us a refund which was later denied and only given a flight two days later. Service the worst I have ever experienced. Unacceptable.

easyJet customer review,10,2014-08-13,Flight from Gatwick to Rhodes 30/07/14. Baggage drop was sorted within 5 minutes while we watched massive queues at all other airlines desks getting impatient. Found this quite amusing! Were then put to the front of the passport queue by an Easyjet staff member to save us some time too! Straight onto plane and we left early as everyone was on board early - great! Service was friendly on board but basic. Smooth flight with no gimmicks. Quick at other end too. Coming back was even better - 5 minutes from getting off the coach to being sat in departure lounge while everyone else joined their huge queues again! Does what it says on the tin really!,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,7,2014-08-13,Flew LGW - Bordeaux on 26th July 2014. Gatwick check-in a complete nightmare - massive queue despite arriving 2.5 hours before the flight. Speedy boarding equally chaotic as some non-'speedy boarders' had already started queuing at the gate and stayed where they were. The two queues then became mixed up with the 'families' who were also trying to board first so 'Speedy Boarding' really not worth the trouble and checking in on-line academic as everyone had to queue anyway.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,3,,True,
easyJet customer review,4,2014-08-13,"Flew from LGW-BFS. First of all our cabin baggage was just 2 centimetres too long and because of that wanted to charge us 45 pounds to put the bag in the hold. Very rude about it. Gate agent who thought she had a little bit of power. So they have us a rubbish bag out of the bin to put our stuff in. By the way this bag has flown in the easyJet cabin before without a problem. When we boarded the plane we told a cabin crew member and rudely said to us ""You must have got away with it before but you didn't this time."" We even saw bigger bags than our one going in the overhead lockers! We told a crew member and he said ""Well I'm not checking the bag sizes."" No customer courtesy! Next my grandmother is disabled and when we boarded the plane since one of our family members booked the flight didn't choose the seats they gave us a window and a middle seat. My grandmother is claustrophobic and has arthritis. We asked if she could have an aisle seat and said there was nothing that could be done and that she would have to take that seat. Not one bit of sympathy! The man who had the aisle seat was kind enough to let her sit on the aisle and he sat at the window! No courtesy from the staff! No help! Outrageously not allowing our bag on because of the wheel being 2 centimetres too long when bigger bags we saw were allowed on!",False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,3,,False,

easyJet customer review,7,2014-08-03,Flew MXP-HAM on July 4th and back three days later. Onward flight delayed half an hour but no big issue as I was travelling for leisure and Hamburg was my final destination. Plane reasonably clean and comfortable crew friendly even if not as professional as you would expect them to be (often making jokes and laugh among themselves). Seat assignment worked fine so the boarding was smooth even though a bit slow both ways as they start to queue people at the gate well in advance. The best things were price and schedule which is what makes you choose a low cost carrier at the end. I often fly Ryanair as they are based in Bergamo where I live and work and it had been a long time (8 years) since I last flew with Easyjet: this experience was ok and I will still consider them as an option for future trips.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,4,,True,

easyJet customer review,3,2014-08-03,LGW to INV. 1) 'Bag drop' and online check in a complete joke when you still have to join a mammoth snake like queue and basically 'check in' anyway! What's the point? 2) Those passengers who do pay extra to check in their hold baggage are only discriminated once on board. The new cabin baggage policy means most passengers take trolley bags on - fair enough. However those who don't and have a small bag or daypack are expected to forfeit their leg room so trolley bags go in the stowage bins. 3) Nice new clean aircraft attentive crew. Pity the magazines were stained torn pages missing and out of date. Basic service. If you can't be bothered replacing them please don't have them in the seat pocket. I gave up looking for the 'menu' because the magazines were filthy. 4) Sorry bring back full service airlines.

Actually in Berlin and Pisa they announce ""boarding"" while the plane is not actually there put all the passengers in the small room with no fresh air and place to seat. Above mentioned airports are very small and look like hangars. Easyjet writes that the boarding ends 30 minutes before flight while actually it opens 30 minutes before or sometimes even later!. The positive thing is that their flights are more or less on time and the tickets are relatively cheap (but not always).",False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,4,,True,

After doors closing a passenger came from a normal seat and sat in 11C. Some airlines would prevent it.

Then we were assigned the last seat on the starboard side of the aircraft despite my wife requiring wheelchair assistance. The return journey on July 18th left right on time but on landing was assigned a parking space in the international section of the airport. This entailed a walk to a bus to enable passengers to get to baggage claim. Of course with my wife requiring wheelchair assistance we were kept on the plane till an ""ambulance"" vehicle arrived to take us to baggage claim.

easyJet customer review,9,2014-07-20,We were caught up in the recent Air Traffic Control strike and while sat with our bags waiting for our transfer to the airport back to Bristol our flight was cancelled. Our only complaint was the text advised of the flight cancellation and what to do re compensation but did not tell us what to do at that very moment. We decided to make our way to the airport anyway and once there joined a queue of other confused passengers. Anyway to cut a long story short we were put in a 4* Marriott Hotel full board for an additional 3 nights at no cost to ourselves. We had agreed to take the Gatwick flight back on the Saturday as this was the only flight available but on reaching the airport early we asked if there might be any chance that there were places on the Bristol flight.

We even landed 30 mins early into Manchester. Perfect. Now let's get to the reason I'm writing this review and that's the crew.

Sitting in Geneva airport and all 3 flights from here (London - 2 flights Venice other) have delays this afternoon 7 July 2014. An easyjet employee had just lied to us he was not aware of any delays to our flights minutes away from an announcement of a multiple hours delay (so that we enter duty free zone where there is obviously no service desk of easyjet). All delays are due to faulty aircraft and not weather conditions. Vote zero out of 10 for easyjets' faulty aircraft no service desk / absence of client service and unqualified staff. My experience with Ryanair recently has been significantly better - no delays and landing on time.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,,1,,False,
easyJet customer review,,2014-07-08,I have been flying with easyjet for years on a regular basis and have recently been disappointed with how rapidly their customer service has declined. The last 3 times I have attempted to fly with easyjet have been disastrous and unnecessarily stressful with little compassion or understanding from staff who can only read legal requirements. The first was when I had a flexifare and attempted to change to earlier flight as per the terms and conditions of this flight but due to an error of assigning the right reference number they charged me a whole new fare. A month later I was going home for the weekend to see my family (I live in London my family in Belfast) and arrived at the airport on Friday to be told the flight was overbooked and they could offer me a flight on Sunday afternoon which of course was useless. This flight was reimbursed with the standard compensation which only just covered the return flight I lost as this was with a different airline. Finally last weekend when I didn't think easyjet could ruin another trip for me I arrived at the airport intending to get my 8pm flight to Edinburgh but the plane had been 'substituted' for another flight so we would only get our flight at around 1am! I asked customer service if they could arrange a hotel or taxi as I would be arriving to a city at 2.30am and I had been planning to make an onward journey but they refused saying my options were 1) to accept the delayed flight and get a refreshment voucher 2) take the 9.30 flight to Glasgow. I decided to go to Glasgow and would have made the last train to my onward destination but low and behold that flight was also delayed. So instead of arriving at 9.30pm to Edinburgh I arrived to Glasgow at 11.20pm. I asked for a refreshment voucher but was told I had a choice between accepting the late flight with a voucher or the Glasgow flight - what options! Easyjet will push away their loyal customers for becoming too greedy.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,1,,False,

easyJet customer review,2,2014-07-06,Rome-London. Next time I will spend the extra money and save all the headache and hassle! 1.5+ hour wait at Rome airport just to drop the baggage. There were around 500 people in line and only 2 agents working. When the staff was questioned about additional agents they said they did not expect these numbers! Like they didn't know how many tickets they had booked for the day? Those passengers who had close departing flights were given priority so those of us who had arrived at the airport in appropriate time were made to wait even longer. After this fiasco we were informed our flight was 2+ hours delayed but we had to wait at the gate the entire time in case they decided to take off earlier. Completely unorganized and uninformed every time I use this discount airline I pay with patience. Flying out of London last year was the same story - ridiculous wait times just to drop the baggage. I suggest they charge a little more for flights and hire more agents!,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,2,,False,
easyJet customer review,10,2014-07-06,Used Easyjet for the first time on return flights from Edinburgh to Krakow and was very impressed especially when compared to Thomas Cook Thomson etc. Check in was slick and easy and flights were on time (both landed early).

On both occasions we wanted to have food on the plane on the return journey back to Southend. On both occasions after the first couple of rows had been served there were no more sandwiches bacon rolls or anything substantial to buy. Four of us coming home from Portugal last week missed breakfast as we left the hotel too early but then our transport to the airport was 40 mins late anyway this meant we only had time to check in and go straight to the boarding area for the plane which meant we were all ravenous by the time we boarded!

easyJet customer review,7,2014-05-18,Great flights both to and from Portugal however the queues at Faro airport easyjet baggage gates were very long. This however may have been caused by the Portugese security which was jam packed. The catering on the flight from Portugal to Liverpool ran out of warm food and other popular items less than a quarter of the way along the plane. The gift selection suffered much the same fate because we were informed the outward flight from Liverpool to Portugal was busy and had used up the supplies. Not a good idea to rely on the catering. better to eat before boarding.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,9,2014-05-18,First time flier with Easyjet Manchester to Paphos return in April 2014. I had not considered Easyjet previously due to poor impression generated by TV documentary. However our expectations were exceeded on both flights. Rapid check in using speedy boarding; friendly efficient staff; very modern clean plane; the extra leg room seats were spacious and firm yet comfortable. Prices competitive. Did not have a meal but refreshments were fine. Flights were on time for both outward and inbound. Highly recommended.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,7,2014-05-13,4 Flights in total EDI-LTN-GVA and the same stop over on the journey home. I have no major complaints about the flights the aircraft was to an acceptable standard cabin crew were okay. Paid extra for speedy boarding more than worth it at EDI and LTN but not Geneva as speedy boarding only gets you onto the bus first so after you get on the bus all that money spent on getting there first as no speedy boarding customers can get on the aircraft before you. Consequently we were some of the last on. Except for that and the fact at the cooked cheese and ham toastie was a bit expensive a very good flights would fly with them again just be careful what airports you book speedy boarding with!,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,3,,True,
easyJet customer review,9,2014-05-12,Three return flights from Bristol to different destinations in the last three months all very satisfactory. All left and arrived on time or a little early staff were efficient and friendly and the aircraft were tidy (one with a new interior was very nice). We only ever had hand luggage (within the stated dimensions) and encountered no problems. I feel easyJet has clearly moved on from its low-cost roots and is now pretty much indistinguishable from legacy carriers admittedly the fares are not much less and can be more unless you book well in advance if you can though it is a good value.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,8,2014-05-11,Inverness - Gatwick - Funchal - Gatwick - Inverness. All flights landed pretty well on schedule. Aircraft clean and crews all very good and efficient - even managed a second pass with drinks on longer legs. A319 a bit cramped but A320 more than adequate. Departure from FNC frustrating - called very early and they even had us lined up beside the apron. then the aircraft landed. Better planning would have reduced over an hour of standing around. Speedy Boarding was worth the cost.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,8,2014-05-10,Very good and clean aircraft. Most of the flights were scheduled on time crew members attitude while giving safety instructions was bad. I would recommend EasyJet for their very lucrative pricing for short haul offerings on time flights and reasonably new aircraft.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,8,2014-05-08,MAN-CFU-MAN. By booking early we got a very good deal for return flights to Corfu: in fact we would not have chosen Corfu but for the good flight prices. The journeys each way were well up to the standards we have always encountered when flying with easyJet: friendly and helpful cabin crews informative flight deck and no hassle at the departure gates. We were held for a time between the gate and the plane in each direction but still managed to depart marginally ahead of schedule and arrive a few minutes early in both cases. The only aspect that detracted from the overall experience was the seating on the A320 for our return flight: instead of the familiar easyJet seats we were faced with what looked like slimline (even economy!) seats. They seemed to offer a little more leg room and possibly better cabin visibility but the three of us all independently commented on the lack of comfort after less than an hour of a three hours' flight. The seats lacked padding and seemed foreshortened as did the armrests My rating for seat comfort is therefore based half on the outward leg and half on the return leg. I hope these uncomfortable seats do not become standard in the future.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,9,2014-05-03,Recently flew Gatwick to Hurghada. Check in was great as Easyjet take up what seems to be an entire check in area of their own. Our hold bag was slightly over but the check in lady kindly ignored this. As we were travelling with our young daughter we boarded ahead of other passengers which allowed us to get settled without holding other passengers up getting things into and out of bags. Service during the flight was great announcements were adequate and we landed ahead of time in Hurghada. I am 6ft 5ins and found leg room to be fine. Sure you can't stretch out but it's fine for the duration of the flight. I really liked what seems to be new seating with thinner more comfortable padding. All in all another good experience with Easyjet.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,10,2014-04-29,EZY 8621 out 26 April return EZY 8628 27 April. Nice new A320 will take a while to change whole fleet cabin crew have a more fitting uniform for the corporate market they have a good age range of crew and as with all walks of life you get good and bad but mostly good As for the food. Well it's not Virgin Cathy or Emirates but it's what you pay for. If you are hungry there is something to eat. They have changed their coffee from Starbucks which for me is good. Luggage issues: they do have some conflicting issues depending where you are ie: only I piece of hand luggage. Then people get on with bags. Does make me laugh. As for the new size I have noted they all stay in the cabin and the larger ones moved to hold at no cost. Speedy boarding I use all the time and it works well. Now as to cost - cheap airline it is not sometimes other providers can be a little cheaper but do they have the amount of flights. No I have had more problems with other airline than ever with easyjet.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,,,3,,True,
easyJet customer review,3,2014-04-27,Easyjet hand luggage system is a joke. All hand luggage was allowed on the plane even if it did not fit the 'new' standard size. Having much smaller bags meant that we had to have 2 pieces under the seat so that they could fit 1 non guaranteed bag on the overhead locker. You are positively discriminated for taking a bag that is smaller that the new guaranteed size. Next time I fly I will be taking my usual size bag as this will end up in the overhead locker and I will get my leg space. No checks on the size of the luggage was performed at time of boarding. It took an extra 30 minutes to load the plane due to the chaos.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,,,2,,False,

easyJet customer review,8,2014-04-23,AMS-London Southend return. Again easyJet did an excellent job and far more cheaper than any airline between The Netherlands and London. We were whisked to London (40 mins) and back (35 mins). Legroom terrible but that's the disadvantage of LC-flying. The only one. Efficient friendly crew good information from the cockpit and swift bagdrop both ways. The only problem is caused by passengers on row 16 and beyond boarding the plane at the front instead of - as requested - from the back. Not easyJet's fault. Southend is a breeze with up to 4 trains/hour to London (1hr).,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,5,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,10,2014-04-23,Flew LTN-ALC-LTN. Flight was at 6am which is a bit early but it was no big deal. Flight took off on time at Luton and arrived on time the other end. Flight was nearly full with 4-5 empty seats both ways. Cabin crew were helpful and friendly. I would recommend easyJet and I fly with them regularly on this route particularly. I didn't have any food so can't comment on that.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,8,2014-04-22,Booked with easyJet due to the cost factor and they were a lot cheaper than all the other airlines I looked into. Checked in online and had hand baggage only which made the whole experience painless and smooth from start to finish. I dislike the policy the airline has regarding just one bag surely if I take a cabin case and a handbag to go under the seat in front this isn't a huge deal! Food onboard was expensive and limited as expected from a low cost airline as with entertainment which was non-existent and not needed on a 2 hour flight anyway.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,8,2014-04-19,London Luton UK - Keflavik Iceland and return journey. Both planes departed slightly late but arrived on schedule. Crew and staff excellent on both legs - friendly polite and in the case of the pilot and captain informative about every aspect of the trip. This is a real help to people who are a little jittery on planes. Seats are reasonably comfortable for a trip under 3 hours - any more and it would start to become an issue. Being able to pre-book a seat on Easyjet is a major step up from the free-for-all chaos of a couple of years ago. The charges for hold luggage are excessive but then this is an airline designed with city breaks in mind so hand luggage should accommodate most people's needs. No in-flight entertainment but don't most people revert to their phones / laptops / tablets these days anyway? Onboard food and drink are pricey but not ridiculously expensive and perfectly adequate compared to some of the muck served by other airlines. Have flown EJ before will do again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,7,2014-04-15,MAN-RAK-MAN - Outbound was a decent flight we had booked extra legroom seats which was nice for a 4 hour flight flight left on time and landed half hour early the FA's worked hard during the flight ensuring toilets were kept clean I agree with other reviews in that the food is expensive. Return trip flight was delayed by 90 minutes at Marrakech but they did not announce the delay until 10 minutes after the flight was meant to depart no announcements or explanation until after we had boarded. What was worrying is that another easyjet flight to Milan was boarding whilst we were waiting and they had adopted a Ryanair style cage to check bag sizes there were a lot of disgruntled passengers Easyjet is my carrier of choice but that will change if they start to adopt cheap money making tactics.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,,2014-04-13,Gatwick - Valencia. When I arrived with my small suitcase and a small backpack with my laptop the assistant told me I could not enter with two bags.

Never again will I fly with easyJet.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,,1,,False,
easyJet customer review,5,2014-04-13,Flew Easyjet from Luton to Tel Aviv in March. Both flights left and arrived on time. Major problems with the flights were the times if left early in the morning and arrived back late at night which necessitated a stay in a hotel. I had a small bag which I wanted to put in the hold but they wanted £30 for the service. No IFE available the food and drinks on the flight over priced.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,3,,False,
easyJet customer review,10,2014-04-13,LGW-VCE/PSA-LGW. Both flights operated to schedule. Boarding swift and efficient. Aircraft (A319's) in good condition and crew friendly and informative.

easyJet customer review,,2014-04-13,We travelled (or tried to!) on 9 April and were supposed to be flying back at 15.10hrs. We were told that there was a technical fault and they would have to fly a plane from the UK which would delay our flight by 7.5 hrs. We were given a £4.50 voucher for food which is an absolute joke. Passengers were treated with great disdain staff were rude and unhelpful and they even left a very old couple in wheelchairs to their own devices. Anyway we decided to get another flight with BA but had a terrible struggle to get our bags back. We were told that now we had booked other flights Easyjet took no responsibility for our bags as it was BAs responsibility to get our bags off the Easyjet plane on the runway! We eventually got our bags after lots of chasing and managed to get our BA flight within the nick of time. Apparently the Easyjet plane finally departed 11 hours late.

easyJet customer review,,2014-04-10,Less Customers less issuesthat was a comment yesterday from one of the EasyJet representative at Gate 17 from London Luton to Berlin Schoenefeld (departure 18.15 pm). They have done anything they could to get rid of customers. I flew with my 3 year old son who I paid full price for. I didn't want to take an extra luggage for him due to the many stairs on the way to the gate. Therefore I took one piece of luggage which was one inch too big. It was only one luggage for both of us. Nothing else and they charged us 45 pounds. Another customer same issue who had no cash and only a ATM Card to pay for his oversized back was refused to enter the aircraft until payment. Luckily another customer helped him out. Never again with EasyJet.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,2,,,1,,False,
easyJet customer review,10,2014-04-10,We flew on an EasyJet Airbus A319-100. We flew from Bristol to Mallorca. FA's were friendly and catered to our every need.

easyJet customer review,10,2014-04-08,Flown with various other carriers in my time but I personally think it's impossible to beat easyJet in terms of practicality and efficiency. Flew London Luton - Madrid Barajas and returned 3 days later. Outgoing flight pushed back on time and departed as scheduled smooth flight very professional and impressively presented crew who were extremely attentive throughout. Lots of communication from the flight deck and arrived 20 minutes early. Bags delivered promptly. Coming home plane arrived 30 minutes before expected departure it was turned around within a matter of minutes and we boarded early. Pushed back approximately 3 minutes early departed with an expected flight time of 1hour and 50 minutes. Plane was absolutely immaculate and again the crew were fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble and everything was handled professionally. Landed at Luton 20 minutes early bags again delivered within 5 minutes of clearing immigration. I would undeniably recommend EasyJet over British Airways and other competitors short haul offerings at least with easyJet you can expect a consistently excellent service on time flights and reasonably new aircraft the low cost carriers and catching up!,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,5,2014-04-07,Gatwick-Malta A321. Service was good but the food seemed pricey! Seats were a bit cramped but better than Flybe. Boarding was easy but took time. Hold items came out on time. Overall it was a good flight.,False,,,Premium Economy,,,3,3,,,3,,True,
easyJet customer review,2,2014-04-06,EZY990. Flew out of Venice to Naples on 5 April 2014. Without notifying any passengers that the flight was to be delayed 2 hours we all stood in line waiting to board. There was also a gate change that happened. Once onboard and inflight we were all informed of the drinks/food they offer however you had to pay for everything including water. Will never fly EasyJet again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,1,,False,
easyJet customer review,,2014-04-03,The Easyjet customer service is really pathetic with no flexibility. I arrived at the Boarding Gate 25 minutes before the flight departure for a short flight from Amsterdam to Luton and was not allowed to board the flight while the gates were still open. I paid additional Euro 80 and had to wait for more than 3 hours to board the next flight.

easyJet customer review,1,2014-04-02,Copenhagen to Basel Switzerland no issues except the walk to the terminal was literally a mile! Baggage was checked for size deemed acceptable but because flight was full they put it with checked bags (no charge as it was correct size). Several days later we flew from Paris (PDG) to Copenhagen. This time the agents were very rude pulling people at random out of line including us to tell us we had to pay 110 euros for our 2 bags (same bags same clothes) as they had to be checked in. We had no choice but pay (it cost as much as the flight). Very poor customer service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,2,,False,
easyJet customer review,9,2014-03-31,BRS-FNC-BRS. Used EJ for the second time in a month both flights early so top marks again. These flights were completely uneventful and everything was as expected which is exactly the way it should be. Even check-in at FNC has improved and was much better than the last time we were there (looks like EJ now has its own staff as opposed to handing agents). The return landing at BRS must have been made by the trainee as we did come down with one hell of a bump (the Cabin Manager actually made a comment on it). Looking forward to our next trip as EJ is now a good airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,5,2014-03-31,The new policy on cabin bags is not acceptable. On a recent flight to from Gatwick to Gibraltar we took identical bags in each direction but were not allowed to take the bags into the cabin on the return leg. The bags had to go into the hold. The bags contained our computers wallets money tickets and other valuable items. These bags were not lockable as we expected to have them with us. Their size has been acceptable on dozens of other flights with Easyjet and other airlines as they are made to fit within the airline in cabin sizing. The excuse for this 'new' ruling was that the flight was full. Every flight that I have been on with Easyjet has been full! They need to address the issue of passengers taking oversize bags onto the aircraft without penalising those of us who always ensure we have the correct size and weight for cabin bags. Until that happens we will fly with other airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,,,4,,False,
easyJet customer review,5,2014-03-30,Although it is an improvement that all seats are now allocated it's worth noting that even if you have purchased an allocated a seat up front this does not mean that you have Speedy Boarding. In fact Speedy Boarding now seems pointless since you need to get to the gate amongst the earliest passengers or so they told me at the gate last night. Seems to me that EasyJet should now copy best practice by proper airlines and board by seat number on busier flights. At the moment it is unnecessarily stressful.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,3,,True,
easyJet customer review,8,2014-03-29,Flew from Gatwick to Sharm-El-Sheikh in Egypt. We arrived at Gatwick and first impressions were not good. Massive check-in queue and the flight left in just over 90 minutes. Thankfully for us they asked everyone for the Sharm bound flight to come forward. Very impressed with this as most airlines leave you to struggle on your own. Friendly staff at counter who couldn't stop smiling and were most helpful. Rushed to the gate and boarded straight away as we had priority boarding (for £20 extra mind you). Brand new A319 Airbus with clean and comfortable seats. Stewardesses were very kind and helpful offering us drinks food and being most attentive. They were so good they got a 4th drinks run in 25 minutes before landing. Had a decent bacon sarnie for breakfast which was a bit pricey at £2.50 but didn't taste like melted plastic. However there was no IFE so had to make do with iPad instead. Had same crew on way back and again were faultless. Overall I will definitely fly with Easyjet again!,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,,2014-03-28,"Without question the worst flying experience in my 45 years of travelling. Departed late kept us queuing for 45 minutes no communication. Returning from Amsterdam the furthest gate out no elevators No bathrooms rude staff who put us through unnecessary steps to measure our baggage kept asking for our boarding basses for no reason barked at us and when I put my luggage in the measuring box and it fit I was told ""It doesn't fit comfortably"" and made us pay 55 Euros each even though we had already paid extra to bring larger bags on board.

easyJet customer review,8,2014-03-19,Milan MXP to Naples and back 3 days later. Both flights full yet boarding ok and both flights landed ahead of schedule. Comfort in the seat is ok for a flight of 2 hours (if you are not too tall or heavy). Booking months in advance the value for money is good.

easyJet customer review,5,2014-03-18,Disappointed to see that EasyJet at Stansted adopt the Ryanair approach to boarding; passengers with two items of hand luggage ie a lady with a handbag and say a stroller are only allowed to carry on one of them! Needless to say my partner put her handbag inside the other and when on board took it out again. The crew were indifferent.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,3,,True,
easyJet customer review,5,2014-03-17,LGW-Malta. Although I am a frequent flyer I did manage to go to the wrong terminal. My fault but the fact that easyJet operate from both terminals at Gatwick is unusual and they should do more to point this out to people before they join the long bag drop queue in South terminal. Fair enough the queues move fast and staff call out the flights that are closing but that isn't much help to you if you are in the wrong terminal altogether. Fortunately in our case we realised our error quickly and we got to north terminal and made our flight but I would argue that the bag drop system needs serious improvement. The actual flight was ok but the seat pitch is unacceptable for such a long flight. It is ok to read but not enough to work on a laptop - this is an issue for business travellers. The only good thing about easyjet is the coffee which is much better than their competitors. The allocated seating is also an improvement but we were allocated seats across the aisle from one another not ideal. I would say easyjet have some way to go before they can say they are really competing with BA etc for business travellers. They need to seriously look at what Norwegian are doing.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,3,,True,
easyJet customer review,9,2014-03-11,BRS-BCN-BRS. Both flights were early so full marks. We've being using EJ since its inception and I think it is now almost on par with BA. These flights were good and the introduction of allocated seating has been a vast improvement. Check-in at Bristol was fast but BCN is still a bit of a wait (always has been -30 minutes this time). Still some room for improvement though. Hand luggage storage is a shambles and £2-50 for a cup of tea is scandalous (but you don't have buy). Prices also seem to have risen dramatically but EJ is still the best of the low cost carriers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,10,2014-03-10,"Have flown easyjet before and would use again in the future. I have returned from a lovely holiday from Portugal today-the flight was slightly delayed due to Air Traffic Control problems in France but this did not affect my experience in the slightest. When it came time to start descent (which I was not aware of) one of the cabin crew tapped me on the shoulder to ask me to put my earphones and phone away on which I was watching a movie. I put everything away in double quick time as soon as I was asked and pushed my bag under the seat in front. As she walked off behind me I heard her comment to either a colleague or another passenger ""there's always one"". I was very annoyed by this and advised one of her colleagues on the way off the plane. I deliberately hung back until most of the passengers had got off so that I did not cause a scene and I deliberately did not go to the woman in question so that it did not get out if hand. The other lady assured me that they have a debrief after every flight and that my comments would be discussed. The whole point of putting the headphones in and watching the movie was for me not to disturb anyone and cabin noise not to disturb me so I was not being ignorant. However her colleagues response to my comment was very professional and reassuring.",False,,,Economy Class,,,3,,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,8,2014-03-10,LGW-VRN (Gatwick-Verona). My first trip with Easyjet and I will admit to a sense of trepidation using a budget airline with a bit of a reputation! Carry-on only so I did not have the apparent burden of queuing to check a bag. I also used the speedy-board option which avoided the one gripe I would have: people boarded the plane from both front and rear but without any consideration to seat allocation meaning that people were trying to pass each other in the aisle with bags in hand - close to mayhem. Seats were comfortable and legroom good (I'm a reasonably tall person) flight attendants very friendly and helpful. In summary I was pleasantly surprised.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,9,2014-03-07,Manchester-Keflavik and return. It has been many years since we last flew with easyJet and all we can say how much they have improved. Our flight from MAN commenced with a lovely smile from the girl on check in which did not take long. Flight on time on outbound. Meals on the aircraft were very good and not too expensive. Aircraft very clean cabin crew excellent and professional both flights. Inbound flight departed 30 mins late from KEF due to taxi ways requiring clearing of snow! Arrived 10 mins late into MAN.

easyJet customer review,,2014-03-06,GVA-LGW LGW-BSL. I have no problem with the flights (full both ways) and the extra-ordinary amount of hand luggage onboard the cabin crew are very pleasant and do a good job. The bag drop at both GVA and LGW is appalling. 55mins to check a bag in at GVA (and half the drop off points closed) 45mins at LGW (all the points open just not enough of them). easyJet seem to have spent a fortune enticing business travellers - complete waste of money if they expect a Business traveller (let alone a holiday maker) to stand shuffling along in a snake-like queue just to check in a bag!

easyJet customer review,10,2014-03-06,We have travelled with Easyjet many times on different aircraft types the latest being a trip from Liverpool to Malaga and return. Outbound was on an older type aircraft the usual bulky seats meaning smaller seat pitch leg- room etc. however still perfectly bearable for the cheap cost and for the short trip. The return flight however was excellent! It must have been a newer aircraft or newer designed interior many passengers were commenting on it. Thinner seat backs and everything more streamlined made for a much more spacious seat pitch and a more comfortable journey. We could not fault it at all. We have never had any problems with Easyjet airport or aircraft staff and we wonder if any negative reviews towards staff are actually 'Easyjet' staff and not in fact the airport staff from the airport they are departing from and therefore nothing to do with Easyjet? We really cannot understand the reviews on here with regards to luggage. Easyjet (along with all airlines including Low- cost) clearly state their hold and hand luggage policy. If you choose to exceed (or ignore) these policies then expect to be challenged or charged (if you aren't then happy days).,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,,2014-03-06,They might be the cheapest but that's for a reason. As a frequent flyer I have never used easyjet but did a quick trip to Germany and needed just a cheap flight instead of transatlantic. You are treated poorly by employees that cannot be bothered. The cabin staff were fine its the boarding staff that I have a problem with seeing passengers getting charge 55 euros for a case which was only a few millimetres too big. I will know if I travel again in Europe would rather pay the extra few pounds and travel with a decent airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,1,,,2,,False,
easyJet customer review,,2014-03-04,Paris to London. The crew member in the boarding line was extremely rude abrupt and uninformative. It was all in relation to cabin baggage being more than one bag mind you the second bag for us was a tiny handbag. We flew from Italy to Paris with no problems carrying exactly the same baggage. We were then rudely pulled out of the line and asked if we understood English in a condescending voice after being given no time to try and fit our handbags into our luggage. We were then sent to the boarding desk because we couldn't fit one in. The crew member there had no idea why we were sent there so he sent us back. We were then told it was going to cost an extra 55 Euro for a bag 1cm thicker than the allowed thickness which is outrageous not to mention we were well under our weight limit. I then noticed that some other passengers had cabin baggage as big as the one we had to pay extra for and put in the hold and also a large handbag or briefcase. In one country we are allowed certain things and the next we are not. For the same company in these countries policies and procedures are different obviously as a result of poor management. I would not recommend anybody use this airline I would rather pay extra for another airline and will be in future.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,1,,,1,,False,
easyJet customer review,5,2014-03-03,"Returned recently from Barcelona back to Newcastle paid for one case in the hold and carried one shoulder bag onto plane couldn't believe the size of the cases people were carrying onto flight some bigger than my case! No one was asked to put bag into bag sizer or indeed no check in staff even bothered to look over the counter. My issue I have with this is apart from stupidly paying for a suitcase when I could easily as it turns out take into the cabin but I was also refused to put my bag into the overhead lockers as they ""have to accommodate the larger cases""! My shoulder bag was the proper size for the flight but as it turns out it was too small. I was told that I had to put it on the floor along with my coat (it was too tall to fit under the seat in front) I had a very uncomfortable 3hrs unable to move my legs the crew member was extremely rude and didn't care about the discomfort. Surely the airlines need to have an idea of the weight of the luggage on board an aircraft? At Newcastle there was virtually no hold baggage apart from ours.

Online booking:–Easyjet have a very user friendly website and their email communication was superb. Baggage charge: I found the £18 charge for a small bag to be outrageous. Bag Drop: the bag drop was straightforward and the staff member efficient but unsmiling and not at all friendly. Boarding: orderly enough but the announcements were not very clear and I saw 2 elderly people struggle unaided. The cabin crew were not at all friendly and seemed disorganised too. One member of the cabin crew was particularly unfriendly and gruff in the way in which he interacted with a young mum and a baby. Later in the flight I bought a coffee and the same man who was rude to the lady with the baby handed me my change with a phoney smile and the money with a strange expression. I checked the change and saw that rather than a £2 coin he had handed me an Arabic coin. I immediately saw this and asked for the correct coinage. It took the efforts of two of his colleagues for me to receive the correct change and no apology. Announcements: there were very few announcements during this journey and no route map at all. The lady captain made one announcement at the end of the flight. Comfort: The seat was rather thin but comfortable enough for the distance flown. Value: the price I paid was quite reasonable. However this was not the cheapest on this route and so I shall shop around in future to make sure I get a good deal.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,3,,True,
easyJet customer review,5,2014-02-24,Paris-Berlin Schonefeld-Paris on 20-22 February 2014. Did not notice any particular problems except the boarding process in Berlin. The part B of the airport from which Easyjet flights depart looks like a hangar with no ventilation and places to sit. There is a huge line for boarding moving very slow. They started boarding before the plane arrived and all the passengers had to wait in very small room overheated with no fresh air. Also they write that the gate closes 30 minutes before departure while in reality it only starts at this time or even later. I guess that is completely unacceptable even for a low-cost.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,3,,True,
easyJet customer review,6,2014-02-21,London Gatwick to Bari. Out on 15 Feb flight over 3 hours late. Sent to distant gate for an on-time takeoff where the flight was not even displayed. No information all afternoon and nobody to ask Kept in-touch via Easyjet website. Panic amongst passengers when flight suddenly displayed as 'Gate Closed'. Terrible customer service non- existent. Flight crew lovely. Return flight on time and up to standard of low cost carrier.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,,2014-02-19,I flew from Edinburgh to London. The crew members checking boarding passes at the gate were rude and uninformative. My bag was too big for the cabin but then I was told I wasn't allowed my small handbag on board even though I was allowed both bags on my flight from London to Edinburgh. When asked why the sudden change in policy she had no answer and ignored me while I stood there clearly confused. I also feel that policies should be consistent throughout all airports you are situated at and all crew should be informed and enforce these policies.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,1,,,,,False,
easyJet customer review,10,2014-02-18,I have flown to Portugal and to Berlin and have found it a joy. The staff were friendly and although on one flight I had delays I can imagine that it would be the same with any airline. I'd recommend getting a larger seat as I do think the cheaper airlines have very small seats. Overall I always look for Easyjet first as I've had good experiences. The inflight food and beverages I tend to steer clear of as they are never that great but you can grab what you need when at the airport and save some pennies.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,,2014-02-14,ALC to LGW: Have utilised Easyjet many times on this route during the past year however sad to say that this may be the last. The cabin crew were rude unapproachable non-existent and rude. They quietly moaned about the passengers within earshot and acted as if cabin baggage was an inconvenience (even for their frequent fliers - including us). As there was insufficient room in the overhead bins for others hand baggage they pushed them in front of the empty seats behind us; as this caused discomfort to myself I made the crew aware and they repositioned it. The flight attendant felt as if she was doing me a favour. Have flown with this airline since their infancy (circa 1997) with no complaints. This was such a shame.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,1,,False,
easyJet customer review,9,2014-02-14,I took several easyjet flights in the last few years (Berlin Rome Venice Copenhagen and Dresden - always departing from Basel). I have to say that I'm pretty happy with it. You pay for what you get. The passengers usually are rude and the seats are tight but for short trips it is ok. I had a big delay once (5+ hours) but normally it leaves on time or with minor delays. I never checked in luggage therefore I can't review that part. I also never eat/drink on board so I don't understand the complaints of many about that. It is an airline not a restaurant! Eat at the aiport if you must! Easyjet is great for short trips (less than 2 hours).,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,5,2014-02-10,My comments relate to the absolutely awful quaintly named 'baggage drop'. To read the easyjet web site this sounds like a casual walk in the park. It is not. Departing Gatwick we were in a zig zag for 50 minutes with the staff constantly going up and down pulling out passengers who were likely to miss their flight thereby pushing the rest of us back in the queue. However worse was to come on the return leg from Copenhagen when we were in a 60 minute baggage drop queue due to there being just one desk open - easyjet will not pay for more. On this showing just what is the difference between check in and baggage drop.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,,,4,,False,
easyJet customer review,10,2014-02-07,Gatwick - Malta EZY8823 2/2/14. Malta - Gatwick EZY8824 6/2/14. We approached Easyjet with some trepidation - having witnessed hoards of passengers running to grab a seat. However this has all now changed. The on-line check-in was relatively simple although we were unable to choose seats for our return flight - however the allocated seats were reserved and we were seated together. Bag drop was simple and extremely well-organised at Gatwick the seats were comfortable and the removal of a reclining function meant that ones knees were never crushed by the person in front! Plenty of leg-room for the average male and the flight attendants were polite and professional. All in all a hassle-free and pleasant experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,7,2014-02-05,I travel on a regular basis with Easyjet but really think it's time to ease up on their draconian baggage rules. Now that Ryanair have seen the light and not only offer priority boarding and allocated seating but they allow you to take a small handbag along with your carryon bag. This just makes life so much easier!,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,10,2014-02-03,LPL-PMI-LPL. A short winter break to Mallorca was made very easy by the efficiency of easyJet. Both flights were full but we still managed to depart and arrive early on both sectors. Cabin crews were both hardworking and patient especially in trying to maximise capacity in the overhead lockers when some passengers seem oblivious of the needs of anyone but themselves. Cockpit crew also kept us well informed throughout both journeys.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,7,2014-01-31,Glasgow to Berlin return flight 23rd to 30th January. Both flights on time aircraft clean seats were fine for what is a short journey. Took longer than usual to board on the outward flight mostly due to the scrum to find overhead locker room for the hand-luggage as people understandably want to save £27 for the privilege of checking-in a case. Only gripe is that Easyjet are not as flexible with hand-luggage as they used to be it's a strict one bag per person rule meaning handbags sandwich bags etc must go in your hand-luggage. In Berlin they were checking the size of the bags in the metal cages so be sure that your bag isn't bulging!,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,1,2014-01-21,EZY8403 LGW-DME 20/1/2014. Would give no stars if I could. Appalling customer service. We were informed at the check in of an hour and a half delay went to have a lunch as now had the time. The flight went on time leaving a few passengers behind. Called the customer services according to their information the flight was delayed and still boarding the ground staff said the flight had left. After a very stressful afternoon the company accepted the liability and rebooked us on another flight the next day. Not worth the money saved poor customer service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,1,,False,
easyJet customer review,2,2014-01-13,Geneva-Bacelona one way (thankfully). The problem with EasyJet is the ground staff. My bag weighed 20.5kg as shown on their scales and they insisted on counting it as 21kg and proceeded to charge extra. I thought I was dreaming. They could not be that fussy and mean. I asked them to re-weigh and it was 20.5kg. They were fussy mean and petty so I had to take an item of clothing and carried it on. The rudeness of the ground staff continued till the gate. With EasyJet you don't save anymore and when you do it is not worth the hassle and bad blood. Never again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,1,,False,
easyJet customer review,8,2014-01-08,This is the 1st time we have ever flown with EasyJet and they do a great job. We flew 4 times with them from Paris-Rome 21/12/13 then Rome-Nice 28/12/13 then Nice-Barcelona 2/01/14 and Barcelona-Paris 7/01/14. We only had 1 small delay and on all other flights left on time. Would recommend.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,9,2014-01-07,LGW - Seville - LGW. We pre-booked seat in the front of the plane and it gave us Speedy Boarding which was very convenient as we could take large bags with us on the plane. Flight to Seville uneventful crew friendly we took off and landed on time. Return flight was little bit delayed due to weather in the UK. Crew again very friendly and chatty. Halfway through the flight we hit bad turbulence the crew tried to put our minds at rest and make us feel better by explaining what is happening. Very professional behaviour from both the crew and the captain.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,5,2014-01-06,Malaga to Basel 9/12/13. Gate opened 15 late and the staff seemed unconcerned despite a queue of 30/40 people waiting. After checking in we were asked to pay an excess of 10 kg despite having paid for 2 golf bags. It appeared that the check in staff didn't know that the golf bag allowance is now 20kg and not the old 12 kg. Then the usual wait at the gate then in the jetty before boarding. Easyjet are OK but if there was another option I would prefer to take it.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,3,,False,
easyJet customer review,2,2014-01-04,Madrid to Paris and return 4 days later. Both flights were late due to boarding delays. It really does seem to take much much longer with allocated seating. I used Easyjet before for years and never had problems choosing a seat. The Easyjet check in agents at Paris were unbelievably rude to everyone and insisted on checking the size of every bag even when they were obviously far smaller than limits. It used to be so easy with Easyjet - not anymore unfortunately.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,,2,,False,
easyJet customer review,8,2014-01-02,LGW-BCN. Good flight for a LCC. At least they are not constantly trying to sell you lottery tickets etc.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,3,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,10,2013-12-31,MAN - BFS return on an A319. Late leaving but early arriving on the outbound and we left and arrived early on the return. Great crew both ways frequent updates from the flight deck and the A319 is a very pleasant plane to fly in. Our landing in Belfast was the smoothest in 30 years of flying and this in bad weather. High marks all round. Cannot comment on the food and drink as I didn't order any.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,,2013-12-31,24th Dec 2013. Manchester to Bilbao. EasyJet was the only company to cancel flights to Bilbao in that afternoon/evening. Weather was improving and all other airlines made it to Bilbao except easyJet. Bilbao airport was never closed. Similar weather conditions days later in Liverpool and not a single easyJet flight was cancelled. Full ticket refund on their website was straightforward so no complaints about that. Staff at Manchester airport were very patient they could not do much about it and had to face all of us frustrated passengers. But equally it was clear that the company had not a clear plan to bring their customers to their destination their advice was more like go home. In spite of all that easyJet when it operates their flights they tend to be very good only when things go out of the ordinary they tend to be very bad. I would still recommend easyJet but passengers should think twice before booking flights on certain important dates without a plan B.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
easyJet customer review,,2013-12-30,Like many we had a horrendous experience travelling or trying to travel with easyjet from/to Gatwick on 24/25 of Dec. Nothing can excuse the abysmal treatment by easyjet of the passengers who were forced to await repatriation from Malaga on 24th Dec. Poor information of passengers throughout especially on the 24th with passengers lurching from delay to delay eventually ending in cancellation after a 7-8 hour wait in the terminal. Being given a voucher for the value of 4.50 Euros in an airport in which a can of coke costs 3.70 Euros and a brownie 3.50 Euros. Having to queue for 2 hours to rebook following cancellation with 200 passengers served by 2 staff eventually reduced to 1 after which we were all told that all the rebooking was useless as we could rebook ourselves or check in normally the following day. Ferried to a hotel and having to queue in the rain and wind for over an hour while a single person was booking in 200 passengers one at a time. Ferried back to the airport the next day at 11 am only to be left in terminal C for over 7 hours with virtually all facilities shut down no attempt to hand out any snacks or refreshment and only one harassed easyjet rep in attendance being clearly out of his depth unable or unwilling to announce anything and to address anything. Absence of sensible and correct information from easyjet with the only source of semi-reliable information coming from passengers with access to the web or contacts in the UK. Had to endure hours of waiting as an aircraft scheduled to take us to Gatwick was diverted to Alicante without explanation for hours with wild rumours circulating on its destination chances of its return and any time estimates. Offered crisps or some low-cost choc sweet and a drink as compensation”for the 7-hour food-less/drink-less wait in an otherwise abandoned terminal. My own verdict is that easyjet's support framework in Malaga is totally inadequate and poorly equipped to deal with unforeseen events. Staff are poorly trained and poorly motivated having no understanding of the importance of talking to passengers and keeping them informed. Your food arrangements in case of serious delays are ludicrous all characteristic of an airline who has forgotten (or never learnt) the importance of customer relations alongside its raison d'etre of maximising its profits.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,1,,False,
easyJet customer review,,2013-12-29,Manchester to Bilbao 24th December 2013. Flight cancelled due to poor weather weather was bad at Bilbao. This was handled very poorly by easyjet staff.

Navigating their website on Christmas Eve was again very unclear.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,1,,,1,,False,

easyJet customer review,,2013-12-20,Manchester to Geneva EZY1949 18 October 2013. Easyjet service has declined over time and one feels more like being herded (like sheep) more than being a valued customer that brings in profit. It feels customers are being squeezed for all they can get out of them. Today was another such example. I had booked tickets for my son on October 2 and he arrived at the airport in time but was told that the flight was overbooked and there were no more seats. He could wait as two people had not shown up. Furthermore there were no more flights for the day. What was he to do sleep at the airport.? They did not even apologise. We were in a panic as we as a family had booked onward flights and he had appointments. How can they overbook when we had booked well over two months ago. It was not that my son just showed up hoping to get on the flight. This is unacceptable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,1,,False,
easyJet customer review,5,2013-12-18,"LGW-DME November. The flight itself was not bad and the staff were good. LGW staff were attentive and helpful. LGW location and time good. I have no complaints about staff or aeroplane. It's the in-flight offering. Paying £7 for a cheese and ham roll and a coffee is a rip-off. Worse is booking online. The fact the flight was advertised at £76 then plus plus plus. £76 becomes £125 and then the most annoying part of all having to pay to reserve your seat knowing if you don't you're going to have a lot of trouble at the airport. I wished I had booked British Airways. At 6'3"" I don't have a choice and by the time the online system permitted me to book the tall persons seats had gone because there is unclear notification on the website that you have to pay additional cash to book your seat if you're checking-in online. Next time I'll get up early and fly BA. Advertised Flight £76. Actual cost with hidden extras £140.",False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,2,,False,
easyJet customer review,10,2013-12-17,I have just returned from visiting my parents in the UK. I travelled from Paphos to Manchester on the 27th November and was satisfied with the flight. The only thing I did not like was the food choice being a vegetarian and having choices of Bacon Ham and cheese or Egg! Other than that fantastic will never rely on their food again. Arrived in Manchester airport 35mins before due time - excellent and was extremely pleased as was starving! Flight back was good cabin crew excellent no food choice again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
easyJet customer review,10,2013-12-17,Fuerteventura on Saturday 23rd November from Bristol. My husband became unwell on our recent flight and the on- board crew were extremely professional quick efficient and discreet. The stewardess who dealt with him knew exactly what to do and treated him with efficient kindness. They were completely unfazed and I can't thank them enough. If it wasn't for her quick intervention we may have had to land at the nearest airport and mucked up everyone's holiday. Brilliant airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,10,2013-12-10,Flying from Faro last Saturday we are caught up in the flight control situation. Our Captain was excellent he stood just outside the flight deck and explained exactly the situation and our options he was calm lucid and just about as helpful as it was possible to be. 3 times during our delay he broadcast updates so that we knew what was going on. The cabin crew did everything possible to keep all of us comfortable. Overall a brilliant customer service experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,,,5,,True,
easyJet customer review,10,2013-12-09,"What can I say about easyjet other than it does exactly what it says on the tin! Great airline easy to use and if flying anywhere in Europe always use easyjet. We flew Bristol to Alicante in October and as with all our previous easyjet flights we were on time clean aircraft comfortable and the cabin crew are as good as Virgin Atlantic. Obviously as a ""no frill's"" airline you don't get ""free food"" or films etc but that said you don't pay for it either and if you want to eat there is good choice on board and for a couple of hours you don't need much anyway. Basically if we are flying to Europe we always fly easyjet.",False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,
