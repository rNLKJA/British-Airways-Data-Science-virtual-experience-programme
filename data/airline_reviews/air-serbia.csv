My booking even did not appear on my personal webpage. So, I sent an email with my booking number to Air Serbia. To order a special meal they advised me to call one of the offices of Air Serbia at the airports and order it. I have spent more than 90 minutes in total on the phone trying to reach different offices in Vienna, Moscow, Krasnodar, Copenhagen, Berlin and Belgrade. Every time I was waiting more than 15 minutes on the line and listened to the message “Please hold the line, all operators are busy”. That time I did not reach the call center by the phone. I sent again an email to their email address, informed them that it is not possible to reach an office, gave them my phone number and asked them to call me back kin order to order a special meal. Nobody called me back and nobody answered to my email. 36 hours before departure I got an email from Air Serbia with an invitation to do online check-in for the flight. I wanted to buy a seat on the first row but in the last step, system did not allow me to proceed with the payment for seat reservation because of a mistake on the website of Air Serbia. So, I decided to call the Air Serbia call centre again. On Jan 6 at 9-57 (Moscow time) I finally reached Air Serbia. I asked the agent to help me with online check-in and to order for me a special meal.

She just told me “I do not know how I can order in the system a special meal for this flight”. As regards online check-in she started to proceed with the booking and after 10 minutes she told me that she cannot choose a seat for me because “the seats are already at the airport in Moscow” and I can register only at the airport. I told her that it cannot be the truth but she was absolutely useless and did not want to help. She could even hardly speak English. I spent almost 15 minutes on the phone with her and she did absolutely nothing for me. I asked her name for a complaint and she refused to tell it to me. I told her that I hope that the call has been recorded. 2 hours before departure I got an email from them (which was obviously an answer to my request which I sent a week ago) where another agent wrote me that a special meal should be ordered 24 hours in advance.

I know they are obligated to give you food and water if the delay is longer than 2-3 hours. There were no representatives of any company to talk to in the TMR airport because we were at the gates and it is a very small airport.

At ~4:30pm, after 6 hours of waiting, they decided that there will send a bus to take us from TMR to BEG (> 3hr of driving, while the OTP - BEG flight was ~1hr) and the plane will return to OTP and we have to make a decision of what to do. I would like to mention that the road death rate in Romania is of ~100 deaths / 1M people and that of flying is ~0 so it is absolutely unacceptable to ask us to take a bus to BEG, put our lives in such danger since we did not book a bus we booked a plane ticket.

Air Serbia customer review,9,2015-04-03,I had 4 flights with JU the route was BUD-BEG-ATH-BEG-BUD. I must say that I was totally satisfied with the airline. As I was reading the reviews here before my trip I was a little bit worried whether it was worth booking with Air Serbia but in the end I had no doubts that the airline made a huge improvement in order to provide a satisfying service for the passengers. The flights between Budapest and Belgrade were operated with ATR 72 aircraft's which were quite uncomfortable but it was alright for that 1 hr 5 mins of flight time. The surprising thing was that a little paper bag with a sandwich and a bottle of water was provided and they also served coffee and tea onboard. Belgrade Airport was okay however the WiFi was didn't work for me. The flights between Belgrade and Athens were operated with an Airbus A319. The seats were as comfortable as onboard of Lufthansa and it beats Finnair in comfort and onboard service. Another paper bag was provided during the flight with a fine sandwich cookie and a bottle of water. We could also ask from a wide range of beverages coke juices beer and wines. The 1 hr 15 mins flight was smooth in both ways. The crew was extremely helpful and nice thus I can say that the impact of Etihad Airways is clearly visible! If you are willing to travel to the Balkans or to Southern Europe don't hesitate to choose Air Serbia it's totally worth its price. (Which was even the cheapest option in case of my Budapest-Athens trip).,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,5,,True,
Air Serbia customer review,3,2015-03-04,ZRH-BEG-OTP-BEG-ZRH: Nice hardware (A319/A320) with very good sets great pitch and on each leg a salami sandwich not very creative and therefore not convincing food although the cookies changed. Cabin personnel friendly but big difference between the announcements in Serbian and English. But for a very competitive price not that bad. Plane for the last leg arrived at time in BEG crew boarded but disembarked 5 minutes before boarding. A plane from Aviolot (their charter company) was brought to the next gate flight was delayed for an hour. Actually no problem rather fly late but with a working plane. Information in English were only given to Biz pax and Serbian speakers which were asked to contact the service desk one after the other. The information letter in English was only handed out at boarding. Simply full of lies: 1) late incoming plane as reason delayed start and landing times wrong cited (so less than 2 hours although it was more writing about refreshments you would have been able to ask for during waiting time but none was brought to the small boarding area).

Planes were nice and tidy while flight attendants were helpful. Sleeping was flawless occupying the empty seats next to me.

Air Serbia customer review,9,2015-01-26,JU305 on 23 January - BRU-BEG. Check-in chaos as a huge group of pushy people crowded the desks - but the agents kept them in line luckily. Boarding was organized and began 35 minutes before scheduled departure time. Flight was packed but ended up with an empty middle seat next to me! Flight attendants welcomed all passengers with a smile and small talk (I don't speak Serbian and I'd say 95% of the passengers were Serbian) but they were all fluent in English. Departed 5 minutes early and nice 1 hour 50 minute flight. Menus were handed out in coach and a yummy chicken or beef dinner was served. Seats were a little hard but for 2 hours who cares. Landed and luggage was on the belt within 5 minutes after going through immigration. Really enjoyed the flight and service.

Me and my husband traveled from Beirut to Prague we landed in Belgrade and had delays both ways. First trip from Beirut was delayed 2 hours so we had to run to catch our flight to Belgrade. I asked 3 times if our luggage was coming with us I got the same answer - yes . When we landed in Prague it was as I suspected our luggage didn't follow with us.

Even though they were ATR 72 airplanes (rather modest in size) I have to say that I had an extremely pleasant experience. Those ATRs looked very good renewed clean warm and pleasant. Flights were on time and according to the schedule staff were extremely polite and helpful. They looked (at least to me) new and with a lot of energy and enthusiasm.

Air Serbia customer review,9,2014-12-04,An absolute surprise! I flew from Belgrade to London on a Sunday morning and was expecting something pretty awful Instead I would rate it as the best European flight I have taken in the past year! Maybe it has something to do with Air Serbia's link up with Etihad but in any case the staff were pleasant I was offered a choice of hot main meal in economy there was plenty of leg room and the flight left and arrived on time.

Air Serbia customer review,7,2014-09-28,BEG-ARN-BEG. Like flying with two different companies. On the first flight to Stockholm it felt like Fawlty Towers on a plane and the purser played the fictional character Manuel. If he could get something wrong he did. The aperitif and nuts came with the main meal “because it is more convenient”. Announcements made on board not understandable because of the poor English spoken in a very fast way. Even though the incompetence of the purser was kind of entertaining from occasionally the whole experience was a disappointment. However things could not have been better than the return flight to Belgrade. Excellent purser and staff who made everything right and could not be more accommodating. Thumbs up! Strangely enough though no champagne offered before takeoff but has to be asked for. Food tasteful but the main dishes slightly dry.,False,,,Business Class,,,5,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,True,
Air Serbia customer review,10,2014-09-22,First time I flew with Air Serbia from Brussels to Athens via Belgrade. Both flights departed late. But the service in Business Class was amazing.

Air Serbia customer review,9,2014-09-17,PRG-BEG BEG-VIE - operated by older ATR planes little bit noisy but ok BEG-LCA IST-BEG - operated by Airbus airplanes - new comfortable. During 3 flights snack served (sandwich cookie small bottle of water + another drink - very enough for such short flights) to LCA meal served (salad meal dessert). One hour delay to LCA (30mins to solve the problem that 2 passengers had same seat on their boarding card) the other flights on time. On way from IST to VIE we had about 1 hour to change in Belgrade it was enough even for our luggage so don't worry. For money they asked for all tickets they offered more than I expected.

I've recently been flying Air Serbia from STR to BEG and BEG to STR in business class. Although the outbound flight was the old JAT Boeing 737 it has truly been the greatest business class experience I've enjoyed onboard a European airline. Very friendly supportive and attentive cabin crew. On the A319 spacious and comfortable new business class seats (only two rows in the front section so a very private atmosphere). Very tasty F&B (especially the chocolate cake). Last but not least a service of drink refills without any demand from the passengers with a good offering of elegant Serbian wines.

Air Serbia customer review,8,2014-08-28,I booked Air Serbia for a flight from VIE to ATH via BEG and enjoyed a comfortable stay onboard. The aircraft's were clean and the seats seemed to be quite new. The catering-concept with paper bags filled with a sandwich a cookie and a bottle of water was very good as you already had something to drink and did not have to wait for the drinks that were served afterwards.

Air Serbia customer review,5,2014-08-26,Agree with punctuality issues: On August 18th we were flying BEG - BRU - New York. There were 52 passengers who had a flight to New York JFK to catch. The airline should know this. Air Serbia decided to wait for a few transit passengers and their baggage risking the flights to New York for the 52 of us thus causing the 52 passengers not making their flight to New York. Other than that: food is the best: nowhere else will you get a cooked meal for a 2 hours flight and it was delicious!,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,True,
Air Serbia customer review,8,2014-08-26,Flew LHR-BEG-LHR. Significant improvement from JAT in terms of on board experience especially aesthetic. A319 interior appearance in terms of seat colour lighting and cleanliness on par if not better than the likes of Lufthansa BA Air France. Plane took off on-time on both legs crew were very kind and helpful and seat comfort was solid. The fact that a full meal was served on a 2.5 hour flight was certainly a plus tasted better than what was served on my BA transatlantic flight home. My only reproach would be the slightly irritating boarding music a tad bit too traditional for a 21st century airline setting. All in all it's clear that the company is on the right track and I would not be surprised if it soon ranks among Europe's best in terms of service quality.

I was very satisfied with the meal and the variety of drinks provided.

The food was served for both flights was a small sandwich from Sarajevo and cold meal from Belgrade. The staff were very efficient pleasant and communicative. However I have one general observation -–both flights were delayed about 1 hour. I observed that a number of flights operating by Air Serbia were delayed. This was a bit stressful taking into account one hour stopover. The air company should pay more attention on punctuality and ground staff who suppose to provide assistance to passengers.

Air Serbia customer review,6,2014-04-27,"Flew BUD-BEG-LCA-BEG-VIE as it was far cheaper than any other airline low-costs including. BUD-BEG was on an older ATR72 there was exactly 12 passengers in the plane. Small snack (a sandwich and a cookie in a doggie bag) and one round of drinks on a one hour long flight! Had to ask specifically for the vegetarian meal we ordered (it was on the plane was labelled with my gf's name was not given out automatically). The ride was a little noisy as in the old ATR but can not complain. Problem-free transfer in BEG security at the gate and BEG-LCA on an ancient Boeing 737-300. It had the old JAT livery stripped down but one could still see the outline of the letters and three dots on the tail - from outside the plane looked just sad. Inside however the seats looked refurbished and to my surprise there was quite a lot of legroom. On this 2 hour flight hot meal was served (menu was handed out). I skipped mine my gf had her vegetarian meal and it looked and tasted fantastic. And a bonus - proper metal cutlery! Round of drinks as well. Return LCA-BEG departing at unholy time (4am in the morning) was delayed about half an hour making us worried about short connection in BEG. This time their ""new"" A319 which is not new at all. The legroom was much worse than on the old 737 and to be honest one of the worst I have ever experienced (I'm 185cm tall). Slept all time so can not comment on the food (but there was some). Bit unorganized transfer in BEG (we were checked all the way to VIE but some other passengers were missing their boarding passes) but I must appreciate that upon leaving the aircraft there was someone for each connecting flight helping the passengers. Last leg BEG-VIE on a sad ATR72 for me a cookie and a yoghurt in a doggie bag the vegetarian meal was an orange (that's it - just orange). Our luggage did not make the short connection in BEG.

A menu on both flights was presented which was a nice touch. The food itself was excellent for a short-haul flight - hot plentiful and served with metal cutlery.

I was flying from London Heathrow to Belgrade yesterday. A great experience there are some bugs to iron out but this isn't first class it's biz class. Firstly the seats were new - they reclined back and the foot part lifted up. You got a big pillow for your back or head and a blanket. We had two stewardesses between 6 of us but I think that is because one of them was training the other. Both women were very friendly and attentive and offered refills throughout the 2hrs 45min flight. The food. Well anyone who has flown with JAT will know the food was something you literally did not bother with. It was sub par. Now I had a 3 course meal with a choice of wines and champagne (or local Serbian brandy if I wanted). The meal was delicious - it was well presented and hot and not overcooked. It was served with fresh bread rolls. I am fussy with things and I couldn't fault it. The cabin was clean. The cutlery was metal. I was offered an iPad but I had my own tablet to watch a film on.

When the flight attendant handed me the menu I thought there must be a fee attached. I got a hot meal free. Excellent experience. On a way back was the same. I came to Belgrade airport ground support staff were smiling professional and accommodating. On the flight back the same good service and experience. Have just bought another ticket with Air Serbia to Thessaloniki!,False,,,Business Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,5,,True,
Air Serbia customer review,9,2014-01-29,ARN-BEG 27 January 2014. Old plane still but fantastic service and great food. Staff did their uttermost to serve the passengers. Good wines with plenty of refills. Strange though that there was nothing sweet to drink with the coffee like for example Baileys. When the new Airbus will enter service they might be one of the best airlines in Europe.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,5,,True,
Air Serbia customer review,7,2014-01-22,BEG-AUH-BNE - 21 Dec 2013. Flight 50% full check-in ok but could not issue ticket or select seat on AUH-BNE component of same ticket which was disappointing. Meal reasonable goulash with gnocchi fine lights on for too long would have preferred brightness lowered soon after take-off for night flight. On arrival to AUH had be bussed to terminal crew decent slight attitude - seemed a bit annoyed that I accidentally called. Otherwise friendly during other times meal service and welcome. Plane looked good and I had whole row to myself so that was great. 7.5 out of 10. Also a bit annoyed to find out unable to earn velocity points even on EY's BNE to AUH since ticket issued by Air Serbia. I'm velocity platinum and AUH-BNE also has VA flight code. Going back in a month and checkmytrip was showing both Etihad and Air Serbia flights AUH to BEG until I advised of this hope it was not blocking others from booking.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,True,
Air Serbia customer review,9,2014-01-21,BEG-SVO 3 Nov 2013. Check in more organized and efficient than before since line separators were used in the terminal building. Boarding efficient and departure on time YU-ANI B733 clean and well maintained with pillows on every seat. Cabin crew in new uniforms and with good and professional attitude. Catering onboard drastically improved it starts with a printed menu distributed even in economy class. Beverage trolleys are well stocked from juice coke wines to scotch (all free of charge). Real cutlery on food trays accompanied by a nice fresh meat / cheese / egg snack yoghurt and fruit salad. All together amazing transition from the old catering serving. Arrival 10 min ahead of schedule. The only improvement could be an additional inflight announcement from the cockpit who only greeted passengers at time of departure from Belgrade.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,5,,True,
Air Serbia customer review,10,2014-01-14,"Initially I flew with JAT Airways back in September from SKG to BEG with an extremely noisy turboprop aircraft. Either due to long service or due to bad maintenance it felt bad and the service was mediocre having two stewards with basic English and average catering. On January 11 I boarded JU523 again from SKG to BEG. I boarded an Emirates leased A319 with Air Serbia livery and had four very kind stewards. I found small pillows in Air Serbia brand on the seats and overall a huge boost in standards. I asked for a seat change due to a knee problem I had for the seats right at the emergency exit corridor and was immediately granted one. The catering from two small cupcakes in foil had changed into a paperbag with a 0.25l water bottle a paper cup and a packed sandwich with options for only cheese cheese and ham or cheese and turkey plus the trolley with the bar. Given the fact that the flight takes slightly over an hour those are excellent choices. Only minor point is the training of the personnel into the new status of the airline calling once ""Welcome onboard JAT Airways flight"" and once ""Thank you for choosing Air Serbia flight"" Overall the impression I got was as if I was in a star alliance equivalent member airline.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,True,
Air Serbia customer review,8,2014-01-10,JU 651 SVO-BEG (27th Dec). B733 YU-ANK seat 2A. Load factor 100% (both J and Y classes). Departed gate 16 min late due to late start of boarding. Cabin crew purser in early 50's but all other members significantly younger. Crew did not provide assistance with overcoats but welcome drinks served. Newspapers menu and food orders taken by purser while taxiing. Served after take off drink with warm nuts. Choice of main food between chicken with vegetables and staffed zucchini. Appetizer consisted of 2-3 shrimps and salmon. Chocolate cake for desert very tasty. Choice between 2 red and 2 white wines and good selection of aperitifs and non alcoholic drinks. Overall good meals and selection but nothing spectacular. Service was good and there is nothing to complain about but it lacked a bit of final touch to categorize it as something one remembers no refills offered (same with bread basket) but after asking I got everything. Cockpit crew made 2 announcements to welcome passengers and also gave in flight details. Arrived BEG about 15 minutes after schedule at gate A10 (operational air bridge). Luggage came in shortly but priority tag status was not observed during delivery. Overall fair rating would be 8 (out of ten). To be improved: earlier check in time of departure punctuality assistance with coats a bit more leg room appetizer could be better and a salad would be a + additional runs with bread / wine (without asking) would be nice. Absolutely not worst than AF or LH European service in business but not quite like Asian or Middle East airlines.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,True,
Air Serbia customer review,10,2014-01-10,"Flew JU656 BEG-SVO on 8/1/14. Departure on time. 100% full even though SU had a flight leaving some 20-30 minutes prior to ours. Catering in business was fantastic worth trying ""home-made meatballs and stuffed peppers"" and Serbian made Chardonnay! Purser and cabin staff very communicative and pleasant. Overall great flight and product even for a red-eye.",False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,,,True,

Air Serbia customer review,3,2014-01-07,"London Heathrow to SKG via Belgrade return and feel disappointed. At the beginning of November my flight which I had booked in May to get a good price was rescheduled and now included a sleepover in Belgrade both ways with no accommodation offered. All 4 flights were late from 30 to 40 minutes without an explanation nor an apology offered. Cabin was very nice new and modern and staff looked professional but were mostly inattentive and got annoyed when asked to move out of the way so people could get to the toilet. Even when I asked for specific help I was ignored by several FAs. English was a problem on the flight back to Heathrow. Drinks get served by 1 member of staff to the entire cabin which takes about an hour. By the time I got my drink I had spent about 2 hours without a drink there is no option to buy any at Belgrade past security check and flight was so late. By the time we got our drinks the meal that had been served an hour before had gone cold the cheese on top of the salad had started to melt and the white wine (served in a small plastic cup) had gone warm. Some people were told ""sorry no beef left chicken only"". That was the only flight that offered a decent meal. I thought overall that a lot of effort has been made with the re-branding and it looks great but customer service is not great and there are organisational issues on board. Most disappointing was the cancellation of the daily connection between Heathrow and SKG and how we were dealt with. I will be avoiding this airline in future.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Serbia customer review,2,2008-06-02,TIV-BEG return economy class. Both flights operated by ATR 72 aircraft. On both legs aircraft showing age cabin dirty and seats old and cramped. One complimentary drink offered on each flight. Cabin crew very polite in spite of their age and dressed in a little bit worn out uniforms. Still the best option on this route.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Serbia customer review,4,2008-05-20,FRA-BEG return last week. Flight experience good quite old but clean Boeing 737-300 cabin crew was friendly. Inflight service very simple (consisted of a small cheese ham and pickles sandwich and beverages) but adequate for a 2 hours flight. Would fly with them again.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Serbia customer review,4,2007-10-27,LHR-Belgrade-LHR in business. Alitalia lounge at Heathrow was quiet and pleasant with adequate facilities. Onboard the 737 business was in a dedicated cabin with three rows of seats in a 2x2 config. These are old-style first class seats with plenty of leg room. Pre-flight juice and water offered sparkling wine on request. FA’s busy and courteous. Food ordinary airline food served in massive portions – a Serbian characteristic. Crew generous with wine and other drinks. Cabin was full but with all that space you hardly noticed. All in all it made me nostalgic for the days when most business classes in Europe were like this – ie a sufficiently different experience to warrant the higher price. JAT’s price is roughly £500 as opposed to BA £800 on the same route. Only slight disappointment was the funereal business lounge at Belgrade (tatty purple leather sofas) but even that offered a waitress service of drinks and snacks. Would definitely fly JAT business again.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Serbia customer review,,2007-04-25,Business class Dubai-Belgrade via Beirut. Very nice flight on 737-300 aircraft in good condition with 12 Business class seats. Cabin crew professional meals with full size trays out of Dubai and Beirut. Luggage claim in Belgrade was quick.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Serbia customer review,,2002-07-10,I regularly travel on JAT Business Class between Zurich and Belgrade and am extremely satisfied with the product which is much better than one would typically expect. Seating is probably the best Business Class seating on short haul flight with 2 x 2 seating big First Class leather seats and only 10-12 seats depending on aircraft type. Service is 4* with hot meals being served even on afternoon flights of one and a half hour duration. early they are usually less expensive to London than BA.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
