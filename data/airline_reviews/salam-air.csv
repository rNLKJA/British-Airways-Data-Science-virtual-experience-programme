"""Don’t ever fly with this airline""",1,2022-11-16,"Disgrace. Don’t ever fly with this airline. They didn’t tell us our flight was cancelled, refused to provide an explanation. We showed up and they were incredibly rude. No refund for the cancelled ticket, no alternative route, no correspondence on their part. Absolute disgrace, avoid this airline at all costs.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Kathmandu via Muscat,October 2022,,,,1,1,,False,
"""customer service is poor""",1,2022-07-13,"The worst flight I have ever been, the customer service is poor. Cabin crews were rude and they even don't know how to talk to the passengers. The flight is too noisy and not comfortable.

"""not extending my ticket voucher""",1,2022-01-29,"Not Verified | With the onslaught of travel restrictions worldwide, Salam Air, in such a crisis has showcased it's money centric ethics by not extending my ticket voucher. Staff in Dammam who doesn't bother to reply email follow ups was very quick to deny any further support. That will be first and last purchase from this unprofessional airline. Please take a note from my experience and choose other flyers.",False,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dammam to Doha,December 2021,,,,,2,,False,
"""Good value for money""",6,2019-08-21,"Dubai to Kuwait via Muscat. I had 2 flights with Salam Air. First leg from Dubai to Muscat was amazing. It was on an A320N aircraft, new seats, friendly crew and very clean aircraft. Probably one of the best lowcosters, or so I thought. Had a 4 hour connection in Muscat, the new airport is stunning, as good as Hamad Airport in Doha. Time flew by very fast in the free lounges in the airport. But my second flight was a whole lot different. The plane was very old, 22 years (A320-200), seats were worn out, plane smelled and during the flight, the inner cover of the window fell out. I called the purser and the following was our conversation: Me: ""Hello, your Window fell out"" Purser: ""My brother, don't worry. Plane Good Quality. Fly 20 years never crash"". Noted. But, the cabin crew was still rather friendly. Overall, for the price I would recommend it. My flight from DXB to KWI via MCT with a bad was 309AED. Good value for money.",True,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Kuwait via Muscat,June 2019,2,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",3,4,,False,1
"""as expected for a budget airline""",5,2019-05-12,"Muscat to Tbilisi. Salam Air is a fairly new budget airline operating out of Muscat, Oman. Check-in in MCT was extremely slow. With only some 10 people in front of me, I needed more than one hour to get my boarding pass. At the gate at the time of boarding, a 30-min delay was announced which – half an hour later – was extended by a further 30 min. This went on in increments until we finally left at 3 am (instead of the scheduled 11 pm). Since there were hardly 30 pax on the A320, everybody had a full row for a short sleep at last. Return was spot on time. Check-in in Tbilissi swift. Plane now packed to the last seat. These are reasonably comfortable but tight, as is to be expected for a budget airline. There is no IFE and no free food. Water was distributed though.",True,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Muscat to Tbilisi,July 2018,3,3,,2,4,,True,
