The last of us got to the hotel around 2:30 where we were dropped off with no information. The hotel was absolutely horrid. The hotel personnel shared no flight information so around noon the next day I asked for a number for the Air Algerie personnel who'd made the reservation. He picked up after about 3 calls and told me not to call back. Around 17:00 we were told to be ready to depart at 00:00. Around 23:40 2 shuttles came. There was a mad, unorganized rush to board the shuttles because there wasn't enough space. I got pushed and shoved but left behind. One shuttle left the hotel without having its door closed. Around 00:30 another shuttle came and I managed to get on. After standing in line at the airport for an hour I got a new boarding pass.

The seat was absolutely filthy, however, and the bathroom was disgusting. My luggage did not come in. I tried to report my luggage as lost but was told I could not because I had no baggage claim tickets (they'd been taken by the airline when I got my new boarding pass).

Anyway 2 hours later a call on the speakers said that all Air Algerie passengers should go to gate 16 for an immediate take off which was at the other end off the airport - everybody rushed to the gate thinking that we will be on air in few minutes. When we got there was a long queue and no sign of the aircraft the staff where sitting there like zombies and there was no explanation offered for the delay - about an hour later a very painful and very slow gate checking process started. Still no information on the delay however by that time it was too late anyway, the transfer to the aircraft was by bus and I waited to the last moment to present myself to the gate desk to avoid stuck in the queues unnecessarily. The waiting in the bus was like for ever and to make matters worst it seems the bus did the tour of Algiers to get us to the aircraft because it was at the other end of the runway. When I got in the aircraft I asked why the delay and I was told it was due to the baggage handlers strike. I asked why didn't Air Algerie offer any information, explanation, refreshments or apologies I was told that even the staff didn't know as they where told to carry on with their duties. Still nobody apologised until take off by the captain which was at around 13.30pm.

We had 2 pay for my 2 young children nearly the full fare and then was told to give up a seat as they had overbooked. I am not from Algeria my husband is though - Algeria is like my second home.

Air Algerie customer review,,2006-09-11,I am an Algerian living the south East of England for last 24 years. My family and I use to fly Air Algerie from London to Algiers about twice a year. The service and the London office became so bad that it was almost impossible to buy a ticket. When Air Algerie was the only airline flying to Algeria people had to travel to London to buy their tickets. In the last few years more European airlines started to fly to Algeria. A lot of Algerians living in the UK prefer to fly Algeria via a connecting flight (Rome Milan and Paris) than flying with Air Algerie. The price of the ticket was in most cases more expensive. More recently BA started flying to Algiers from London and this provide us an alternative option. My family and most of our friends fly with BA with travelling to London. I think Air Algerie provides better food than BA but the FA on the BA flights project a more professional image.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Algerie customer review,,2006-05-31,The service is a shambles! I have travelled with Air Algerie more than 6 times since July 05. Their systems need to be modernised! No allocated seating carry your own suitcase to the porters on the runway cabin crew never smile or ask if you are okay. Baggage allowance for different people. The only positive comment is they serve relatively hot food. What saddens me more than anything is the fact that the flight is so short it doesn't take alot to make it a good flight! The price you pay is extortionate in comparison to what you receive!,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Algerie customer review,,2005-10-21,I have never encountered an airline where the passengers themselves have to collect the luggage from the runway!

Air Algerie customer review,,2005-08-15,What a disappointment! Air Algerie need to improve if their star rating and credibility with other operators is to be upped. My ticket was purchased in the UK through an independent travel broker. No problems there but the ticket was not available for collection when I arrived to check-in at Heathrow. The incompetent Air Algerie rep then took one hour to sort this problem out. To add insult to injury I was flying business class but did not get to see the lounge or do any shopping as the check-in desk had closed by the the time my problem had been resolved. Business class on Air Algerie is a joke. The only additional privilege I could see was an extra four inches of leg room. The interior of the aircraft was shabby the upholstery was dirty and there was even old food and hair in the table stowage area. The food was ok and the service was relatively attentive but I couldn't help but think that it was all a bit too much of an effort for the staff. Come on Air Algerie. Get a grip on your customer service priorities refurbish the aircraft change the menu provide service with a smile - and keep the cabin clean!,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Algerie customer review,,2005-06-28,I'm an Algerian living in Ottawa Canada. I fly with Air Algerie every two years for my vacation to Algeria. I always leave Montreal or Toronto for some European city and then connect with Air Algerie to Algiers. I also use Air Algerie domestically when i arrive to fly Algiers-Annaba. Flying with them every two years has given me the privilege of seeing the airline grow and IMPROVE. The food is great and plentiful even on the 2h flights from Paris and Frankfurt and the 1h30min. flights from Casablanca. Most other airlines don't even offer HOT meals on such short flights. I find their planes to be quite nice and they are trying to improve them. They phased out the 727s and 732s leaving only the newest and best also adding to it the Airbus 332s. The extension of the International terminal at Algiers gives you a more comfortable and modern lounge/check-in area and hopefully with the completion of the new terminal it will be even better. I find their only problem to be frequent delays. Other than that good service and good planes.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Algerie customer review,,2005-06-24,Lyon to Annaba on Air Algerie yesterday. My father who lives in Annaba flies Air Algerie regularly on work and is absolutely fed up with the airline. At Lyon one corner had been allocated for Air Algerie check-in. It seems even the airport authorities have given up on that corner. A good amount of chaos. In the line before the immigration gate few Algerians broke the wire cordon jumped in and broke the queue in spite of being reprimanded by airport officials. Boarding was disorganized with no priority boarding for business class or for the elderly. Upon entering the plane I discovered that seat numbers meant nothing. My seat was occupied and the FA politely told me I could sit anywhere! Food was horrible. They ran out of water bottles and started serving water in glasses poured out at the back of the aircraft. The water had a fair amount of salt in it. Upon landing at Annaba it took us over an hour to get out of the chaotic airport despite having cleared immigration in 10 minutes. Basically the bags took that long to come out and this when the Lyon flight was the only flight that arrived at the airport that time...when we landed there was not a single aircraft other than ours (domestic or international!!),False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Algerie customer review,,2005-05-23,I live in London . I agree with all the negative points said by the people in the comments and I would like to add that it is impossible for people to get through the phone to contact Air Algerie agency in order to book or to buy a ticket - and if we make a booking through internet we don't get an answer that the booking has been accepted or not !,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Algerie customer review,,2005-04-20,Positives : Food quality. Recent efforts to renew the fleet. Crew friendliness Non-smoking restrictions (though I'm a smoker I consider this a plus) Negatives : Delays (too frequent). Transit lounge (poor comfort). Business & First Class lounge (poor comfort as compared to other airlines). Hygiene on board (dirty WCs sometimes even dirty seats). Inflight entertainment (non-existent). Seating allocation (non-existent). Algiers airport duty free shopping and facilities (poor standards). One of the most expensive airline for $ per distance.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Algerie customer review,,2005-04-05,The Air Algerie fleet is totally renewed they now have brand new A330 on international routes safe and clean all flights are non smoking. The airport security is top notch. The food served onboard is good for medium range flights. Contrary to what some people say Air Algerie does allocate seats like other airlines but it is true that some passengers seem to not take that into account which tends to stress the staff into attitudes that are not very friendly during the first 15mns of boarding. Air Algerie has seen a huge improvement in service with the introduction of new planes. I recommend this airline yet I would like to see them adopt a world class frequent flyer program.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Algerie customer review,,2004-11-02,What I don't understand is why AIR ALGERIE is not allocating seats when people check in. This creates a big confusion. It is not the passengers fault but it is the airline which doesn't allocate seats. It wasn't used to be like that in the past.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Algerie customer review,,2004-08-19,My wife and I use Air-Algerie twice a year to go from London to Algiers and we usually use the company for internal flights as well. I can say with confidence that both security at airport and food during the flight are the best in the world. The Fleet maybe a little old but the level of maintenance carried out on the planes must be very high. The service provided by the crew is probably poor but I can assure you that the worst of Air-Algerie is the quality of the passengers. Everyone thinks the plane is his or her so he/she can seat anywhere smoke whenever they are pleased take overweighed hand luggage and use their mobile phones during the flight. I do advice people to fly with Air-Algerie but remember to be a good passenger and you will see how will be treated.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Algerie customer review,,2004-08-13,My wife and I travel regularly between West Africa and Europe and about a year ago we decided to try Air Algerie to avoid the burden of Air France's unpleasant staff and ridiculously low checked baggage weight limits (economy: 23 kgs!). We were surprised to enjoy a relatively pleasant experience with Air Algerie (Y class) flying recent aircraft (738 and 735s) with acceptable delays (~15-30mns) and fast connections in Algiers on both legs for about half the cost of the AF ticket. The only negative side was a cold uncomfortable transit room in Algiers airport on the outbound flight. On that leg travel time incl. connection was shorter than that of AF. Given the above plus the quality and quantity of food served onboard highlighted by others I consider Air Algerie a fair alternative to Air France on Europe-West Africa routes.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Algerie customer review,,2004-04-12,As it's the only option in Algeria I travel twice a month with Air Algerie and I can’t tell lots of things need to be done within the company itself for instance all Personnel need to have a worthy training to learn how to treat customers to improve their poor service quality.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Algerie customer review,,2004-04-11,I fly sometimes with Air Algerie and it is not worst nor better than all other flight companies. For the security all the airplanes in world are submitted to the same safety constraints so it is not more dangerous to fly with Air Algerie than to fly with others (All Air Algerie airplanes are from the last generation Boeing or Airbus). And the greater decision Air Algerie has taken is to eliminate smoking in their airplanes. For the delays I think is problem of security which is taken really seriously by Algerian authorities and also because there are simply not enough parking place at Algiers Airport which will be resolved with the new airport.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Algerie customer review,,2003-12-31,I am an Algerian living in London I used the the service once from London it was the most expensive horrific and time wasting in my life.

Air Algerie customer review,,2003-12-08,As an expat living in Algeria I frequently have to use the services of Air Algérie for going on business trips. As a frequent user I can only confirm what others say about Air Algérie. The planes are 90% of the time late the service is miserable and the planes are in a state where most airlines would take them out of service. Only small highlight is the consistent quality of the food which is not refined but good tasting. Air Algérie certainly is part of the Algeria experience but those who are scared of flying may not find this the most reassuring airline to go with. A word of advice as a business traveller - take business class there is a small lounge at the Airport in Algiers where you can at least pass your time when the flight is delayed.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Air Algerie customer review,,2003-05-24,I fly Air Algerie on a regular basis - they are habitually late because of security. For instance when departing Algiers all passengers must identify their luggage which is laid out on the tarmac prior to boarding the aircraft. For this I have no problem. The latest I have ever been leaving Algiers is 45 minutes. It gives me ample time to catch any connecting flights to my next destination. The other reason why they are quite often delayed flying back to Algiers is because there are simply not enough parking spots at the Airport in for incoming flights therefore they wait in Paris Rome Frankfurt etc until a spot can be allocated for the aircraft. The crew is always more than accommodating with refreshments and anything they can do to assist with comfort. They have eliminated smoking on the flights but some people still light up. When this happens they tell the person to put out the cigarette and if the person refuses they are told that should they refuse to extinguish the cigarette - then once they arrivedat the destination the local authorities will be contacted this usually takes care of the problem.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
