"""food less elaborate than before""",5,2022-11-15,"Not Verified |  TAP has been my go to airline for flights to Portugal. The airline has competative business class fares and service is ok. I have flown with them dozens of times always in business class and usually it's fine. The first flight from AMS to LIS was delayed by over an hour because ""transportation did not show up at the hotel to pick up the crew, who stayed there overnight"". Its the first time I heard that excuse and quite troubling what the background of that probably is. Amsterdam has excellent taxi service that could have kept all this limited to a 10 minute delay, unclear why it took hours and no-one including gate staff was informed. Flight otherwise okay, okayish breakfast tray, seating tight (no empty seat next to you on EMB aircraft) Empty seats in business class were filled with crew on standby tickets who then received plenty of laughs and service from the crew. Lounge in Lisbon closed without prior message from TAP: terrible. Voucher (10E) provided but pretty useless at overcrowded Lisbon Airport. Flight to Funchal on new A321 with fantastic intercontinental seating in business. Full flat beds, full entertainment. Very impressed with the hardware. Flight delayed by almost 2 hours. Good hot meal, wine trolley and quick ok service, empty seats in business again filled with airline staff on stand by tickets. Remote handling at Lisbon is not very premium friendly. Return flight from Funchal over an hour late. TAP's app completely usesless as it does not update you on anything. Flightradar gives you all the info that TAP doesn't. Lounge at Funchal closed without prior message to us the passengers, voucher provided. A319 offers a more sparse business class cabin. But again a full hot meal, best crew out of an otherwise awful team of FA's. In general TAP's crew misses communication skills and a bit of flair, but on this flight we got some personality: great. Last flight LIS to AMS again with A319. Flight on time. Business class full with upgraded TAP staff. Good hot meal. All meal trays by TAP in business look good, I miss pepper and salt, seems that has been eliminated for cost reasons, food also less elaborate than before. Wines in business are really rough, but local, so that part is appreciated.

"""do not fly TAP Portugal""",1,2022-11-15,"My experience with this airline has been an absolute nightmare. My wife and I made 3 reservations from Chicago > Lisbon, Lisbon > Barcelona, and Madrid > Chicago starting Nov. 14th through Nov. 23rd. My wife was unfortunately diagnosed with a tumor and needs emergency surgery, which is on Nov. 17th (overlaps with our trip) so I called TAP Portugal and that is were the nightmare started. First and foremost when you call their customer service line be ready to be placed on hold for at least 1 - 2 hours and prepare for calls to be disconnected after the 2 hour mark. The first time I called I was told to send the doctors letter to their document email, which I did. After not hearing whether the document was approved, which why would it not be approved if the doctors letter specifically states my wife has a tumor and can't travel, I called TAP Portugal who informed me the tickets have been suspended and I would NOT be charged a penalty fee once we rebooked. My wife and I then looked to rebook our trip in April of 2023 and while attempting to rebook our trip with another representative they tell us that the doctors letter was not approved because it did not specifically state my wife had an ""oncological disease"" therefore a penalty to rebook would be applied. I was honestly appalled but we had the doctor send an updated letter stating the words ""oncological disease."" We called the day after we sent the updated letter and once again I was on hold for roughly 2 hours then the call disconnected. It's worth noting that I was frustrated throughout my conversations with TAP Portugal but not once was I unprofessional prompting to be hung up on. I then send them an email explaining how unprofessional their customer service team have been and the lack of communication/empathy from the airline. I informed them about the new trip we would like to rebook via email and still to this day I have not heard from anyone. Yesterday I called a representative to confirm if the letter had been approved and to rebook our trip ...bonce again I was on the line for 2 hours while Mark, who has been the most helpful representative out of anyone I have spoken to, attempted to help rebook our trip. While attempting to rebook our trip Mark informed us we would have to pay a total of $1000 on top of what we already paid due to the difference in cost. That same flight he was attempting to book for us in April was much cheaper a couple of days when I requested a phone call but of course I never received a response so after a couple of days later the prices of those flights increased. It doesn't make sense why we would need to pay a bigger difference if the lack of communication is stemming from the airline. To put the cherry on top, after informing the agent at this point we want a voucher or a refund he was speaking and the call disconnected. I cant' explain how terrible this experience has been. We are already dealing with my wife's health and this has made the experience even worse. Unfortunately, I still have not heard back from TAP Portugal.

If a ticket was bought why would you overbook a flight? Is there another way of getting on the flight without a seat? Perhaps there is a way to strap travelers to the wings. So with all the confusion at the airport, TAP decided to issue vouchers and put them on the next day flight. Upon arriving at Newark Airport they had lost their luggage.

Now it's November 11th, I'm currently on the phone with them for over an hour & this is my 2nd call today. I was off today & decided to call them @ 6:30 am. Now the issue is that the voucher they gave my daughter & my mom is invalid. I gave them all the info from what seems to be a voucher but it's invalid. I can't use it online to book a flight for my daughter & the rest of the family. I've been at this for a total of 2 weeks now & the costs of the flights have now increased by about $650.

I was not given any place to stay during that time, and was merely told that ""the hotels close by were booked and that I could book one myself and send them the receipt later"". It was 9:30pm at this time. I am a woman, 22 years old, and obviously was not comfortable to go out there all by myself to find a place to stay at this hour. Thankfully, since I had friends in Porto I was able to solve my issue, and TAP did absolutely nothing about this. I tried contacting them demanding an earlier flight (since I was basically losing a whole day in Dublin due to this) and they had no other options. The next day I went there, the flight from Porto to Lisbon went well, but in the flight from Lisbon to Dublin they had more passengers than what was supposed to and so we had to wait an hour for them to recount the passengers and check each persons boarding pass. My boarding pass had an issue since my seat did not have my name in it, but thankfully nothing happened beyond that. Then we flew and finally arrived at Dublin an hour later than what was scheduled, but thankfully my layover was 2 hours and a half, so there was no issue, and taking into consideration all that had happened before, that was the least of my concerns. Fast forward to my returning flight, October the 3rd. The same problem happened, meaning we had to yet again count all the passengers and the flight was yet again delayed. This time though, my layover was only 1 hour, so I was at risk of missing the next flight (from Lisbon to Porto). Thing is, this flight was delayed, and it only left at 11:50pm (initially it was scheduled to depart at 11:30pm, and since I arrived at 11:30pm it was the perfect time to still be able to make it). Without any explanation whatsoever, my flight was cancelled and rebooked to October 4th, 7am, even though there was a flight that night from Lisbon to Porto. There was absolutely no one at the airport that could help me, everything was closed, no one was there to get me a place to sleep in, and the TAP calling centre obviously could not arrange for a hotel remotely. With that being said, I had to spend the night at the airport, which, needless to say, was absolutely horrible, and definitely not a pleasant experience especially when you are alone, and was something I was not mentally prepared to do. If it had been my decision I would have been prepared, but it was forced on me. TLDR: TAP has absolutely no concern for its customers and has a huge problem with management.

Our original light was from Chicago to Lisbon but TAP canceled that so we rebooked departing from JFK. All legs were supposed to be their version of First Class. When we get to JFK and board they stuck us in Economy along with sticking us in economy from Lisbon to Rome. Not sure why because our tickets indicated Premium Seats. So we got screwed on those two legs. Customer service was garbage and might as well have been non-existent. Our departure from Florence, It seemed to be better as they actually boarded us into their first class this time. Our departure from Lisbon was just as nice as they boarded us in their first class on this leg as well. Once we landed in Chicago (late at night) we found out that they lost one of our new suitcases with all of my youngest daughter's clothes. Then the nightmare begins, why? Because customer service is horrible with TAP. I even notified TAP the same night that the suitcase was missing. They told me the next morning that I was supposed to notify the TAP representative at the airport. Well, there was not TAP representative at the airport (we tried that night before leaving the airport). The airport said it was a TAP issue and TAP said it was an airport issue. All I know is that they can supposedly track the bag and find out where it was last 'seen' by the baggage system, yet, nobody has a clue as to where the suitcase is. Our Trip was in May 2022 and we have yet to get any kind of resolution with regards to the lost suitcase and its contents. It is not as if there were not tracking stickers placed all over the bag and that the luggage system does actually track your luggage. But for some reason they just can not locate our suit case in Florence, Lisbon or Chicago. That is amazing to me considering we are in the digital age and everything is tracked at every turn. At one time TAP actually emailed me that the suitcase had been found and actually delivered to me. They only had two addresses: my house and my office. The suitcase was not delivered to either one. I emailed back asking ""where"" the bag was delivered and have yet to hear back from them (been over two months ago despite me emailing and trying to call several times).

"""unimpressed by the attitude and service""",7,2022-08-24,"A very mixed experience on this trip with TAP. The Manchester to Lisbon flight on the E195 was pretty good. Had front row seat with plenty of leg room. Long wait before seat belt off signs and breakfast but food not bad and service efficient. Layover in Lisbon quite short and made more stressful due to having to be bused to terminal. Lisbon to Cancun flight was on the new A330-900 plane with the lie flat business seats in a 1-2-1 configuration. Again, we were bused to plane which sort of defeats the priority business class lave at the gate. No welcome on board whatsoever, no welcome drink .. basically it was fend for yourselves which for business class passengers paying thousands of pounds for their tickets is not acceptable. All the cabin crew in the business class section were, lets say, of the more experienced type and as such had no personality at all and pretty much ignored the passengers around them, apart from officiously ensuring masks were worn. The seat is comfortable although the controls are not at all intuitive and the space for your feet once reclined is very limited. Food was good although served after a long wait and then all at the same time. Wines were excellent as was port with the cheese but after the meal service there was absolutely no service from the crew whatsoever. No enquiring whether you needed anything and certainly no offer of extra drinks. They simply hid away behind the curtains until the pre arrival snack made an appearance. This was tasty. On landing it was obvious that they were glad to be finished and off to their hotel. Very poor service. My checked bag did not arrive with me and I did not get my bag until day 4 (there were at least 20 other passengers without bags behind me in queue). Getting hold of bag handler to check on status in Cancun was impossible and I feel lucky to have actually got my bag delivered to me. In transit, 4 shirts and an aftershave had been stolen to compound matters. Return flight check in was chaos with the premium lane being used to check in a family group in economy resulting in me and other premium passengers having to check in at the economy desk. Lounge at Cancun (not TAP's) was excellent. Same shoddy 'service' on return flight with again, decent food and a very good entertainment selection. Lounge in Lisbon (TAP lounge) had everything you could need but not enough seating, cafeteria like set up and very poor toilets. Premium boarding for LIS/MAN flight was handled well and a very warm welcome from a couple of, lets say, less experienced, enthusiastic cabin crew. Plenty of space for a A320 plane and a three course meal (with a choice and menu card) and a good selection of drinks. In fact they were extremely attentive with the wine bottle even telling me I had plenty of time for another glass before landing. This last flight shows that TAP can get things right but it mostly comes down to the cabin crew.

The Business Class was subpar comparatively. Food was about the same as in Economy. The configuration is 2-1-2 aside seating in Business. The legroom was awful and suggest avoiding the single berth seats. Ingress and Egress was less than 10 inches. The foot wells in single berth Business are tiny and cramped. There are no armrests and your arms rest on metal ""pods"" (which are the foot wells for the twin seat berths). The real issue was the flight was 2+ hours delayed.  They loaded us on to Buses 20 minutes after boarding had commenced which held about 60 folks each to move us to the Aircraft which was parked out by a maintenance hangar. Covid protocols be damned it looked like by TAP. The Bus I was on (first one) had graffiti all over it and no working Air Conditioning. We sat under the gate waiting to be ferried for 30 minutes in 30C+ temperatures on the tarmac on the bus it hit 33C as packed as we were. The then moved us to the aircraft.

We finally got to the gate, more than an hour prior the department, but were told, that they can't give us the boarding passes. It took about 5 people running around with our passports for an hour, handing them one to another, when finally the plane departed and we weren't allowed to board it. At the end, they gave us back ONLY 2 PASSPORTS! So I told them, they had 3, which finally they found it and gave it to me. The fault was on their part (their system), which they accepted.

We were kept on the plane for 3 hours, suffering through the horrible stench of gas. Throughout this time, the crew offered us no information nor basic necessities such as water. Next we were informed that the plane was NOT going to take off and we took a bus back; upon entering the airport there was no Tap Portugal employee there to greet us or inform the over 200 passengers on what to do. After over an hour of scrambling around the airport completely lost, a random Tap employee showed us and told us to follow them to the desk where they supplied us with a dinner voucher worth 12 euros and told us to come back at 11pm. Note that on countless occasions we had asked the employees regarding our situation and they assured us that we would be put in a hotel and our bags would go directly to Toronto. After dinner, in which we had to pay for the majority ourselves given the expensive prices at the airport in which a bottle of water cost 4 euros, we returned to the booth.

Upon rebooking our flight for the next day, they informed us that all the hotels in Lisbon were booked and that they would not be providing a hotel. Suddenly a very rude Tap employee came screaming at us, stating that we had to go collect our luggage or they would be sent to lost and found.

Back on the website to insert the seat reservation myself, the original low price was shown on the screen. After sending them a written complaint with screenshots, got a mail back a week after, just telling me to use their calling number with a certain code. Was connected to the wrong place (again after waiting endlessly), but the lady could at least inform me that booking via call center is charged with an extra administration fee. Nobody had told me this - I would first have tried to book from a different computer or waited a few days, if I had known. Also the seat reservations changed or even disappeared over time thus had to adjust them just before the check in.

I paid for extra legroom seats on the oceanic sectors, which were very comfortable. The food provided on the oceanic sectors was good - they served it with real silverware, which is something I've never seen a US airline do in Economy. Also, even on the 75 minute AGP-LIS sector they offered free coffee and tea - something which most US airlines don't do for that short a flight and most European airlines charge for, and I really appreciated both that they did it at all and that it was free. The service on the ground could be improved - when I needed to change my flight it proved impossible to do online, and it took a month to get through to someone at the phone center.

Unfortunately, this is not only false, but TAP does not allow you to reschedule your flight either, regardless of additional fees. This means that any booking is lost. Since TAP does not have a working online service and the operators never reply to the phone, refund is not possible even if you have flight insurance. I spent over 8 hours at the phone and it is the same story: the operators do not pick up the phone or redirect you to a loop of other operators putting you on hold for hours. The outcome of this process is the charge on your phone (unless you are using a Portuguese number). You will soon notice a pattern: in the remote event that an operator replies, you are redirected to another one and so on for hours. Be aware of this and do not be accommodating, leave negative feedbacks and let them hear your voice. The scam machine does not stop to that, with very high fees (hundreds of euros) for extra-sized/weighted baggage and shady requirements, the extra fees are around the corner. Although they claim a classic 55x40x20 bag requirement, intentional random contestations are frequent and it will be difficult to prove your case unless you bring a ruler with you. Before booking with them, really consider the chance of being targeted by one of their scam loops and ending up paying more than a high-yield ticket with any other company. Seats are less comfortable when compared to other competitors in the same price range, do not have phone chargers, are very old and quite dirty. The food was plain, but it still gave me an upset stomach. Overall, this is a disastrous company without passenger assistance at any level (online, on the ground, at the phone). Do not book with them in any form: not on their website and absolutely not by agency (this would double the time you need to waste on the phone with no results). Try to skip TAP and jump to other companies when you're searching for a flight: price differences, if any, are illusory. Instead you will get disservice, lose a lot of your time and possibly several hidden fees.",False,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Rome via Lisbon,January 2022,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,False,1
"""Extremely dissatisfied with this company""",1,2022-01-04,"Extremely dissatisfied with this company. Stay away from TAP at any cost, the price is not worth the disservice. Do not fly with this company during the COVID-19 pandemic since they do not offer any refund for lost flights due to covid positivity. They consider any missed flight a no-show and deny any reimbursement. To do this, they rely on a loop created by the 24h requirement for most COVID tests. They will ask you to send documentation to their email address and they will not provide any reply. When the flight has passed, they will claim it as a no-show and deny refund according to their policy. Be aware and avoid this company, near-bankruptcy does not justify such embarrassing behavior. Flights are very uncomfortable, missing basic elements including phone chargers. The equipment is very old and poorly maintained. Food is poor quality, although not the worst I've had on an aircraft. On-board WI-FI does not work. The staff are unhelpful. The operators often hung up on you in order not to reply or to delay your assistance. As practical example, I spent nearly 3 hours on hold with no useful assistance. The ground staff at the airport is useless: they do not have access to any modification/change of your reservation. The online system is worthless, it does not allow modifications when they are needed, probably due to a precise intent to deny reimbursement. Fees and charges are far above average for extra baggage. A fee is charged for extra size and weight which can potentially add up to hundreds of euros per baggage. Although this information is not clearly accessible on TAP website, it can be found online from other sources. In summary, avoid this company at any cost. There are many other companies with similar prices that offer a better service. Do not book with this company during the COVID-19 pandemic since they do not offer any refund on tickets. Due to general disservice it may also be unsafe and dangerous to travel with them. In the unfortunate event that you have already booked a flight with them, basic survival tips include: do not check-in your bags at the airport to minimize the contact with the staff. Instead, check every bag online and go directly to the gate: due to the poor service, no scales or meters are available at the gate and it's more likely to avoid tricks on the baggage. For COVID-related refunds there is almost nothing to do, be careful not to get it so that they cannot capitalize on your sickness. In any case, communicate with them by certified email with confirmation receipt and never leave a phone call without any email confirmation. As a final note, do not leave any positive feedback on the phone surveys until you have your issue completely resolved (which will most likely never happen). This is a final trick they use to deny you proper treatment and make it result as a positive feedback: when they bounce you around between operators or ask you to call back, leave no feedback or a negative feedback after the call.",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Rome via Lisbon,December 2021,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,False,1

"""unbelievably frustrating experience""",1,2021-12-16,"Not Verified | TAP Portugal was the worst airline experience I have ever had the misfortune of flying on. Upon arriving at the gate of my connecting flight, two hours in advance, I was told that my American vaccine pass would not work and only EU passes were accepted. I had read every email sent to me, visited the website several times, and even looked up if American vaccine passes were allowed. I was forced to sprint through the airport with the many other people that were turned away and go to take a covid test. The covid test was in terminal 1 (we were in terminal 5). We were then forced to pay $400 to get a test to board the plane. I barely made it back before the gates closed. Many passengers missed the flight. Upon arriving in Portugal (my connecting destination) the plane took more than an hour to de-board. We were then all forced on to buses and driven to the airport which was not a short distance away. By the time I got to my connecting flight, I still had thirty minutes before the flight took off, however, they had shut the doors and didn’t let any of the people from my connection onto the flight as it was already overbooked. This caused me to miss the train I had paid for and my Airbnb check-in time. I went to the help desk as I was frustrated with the situation and all they said was that I could contact them through a link on their website. I never heard back after several attempts to contact them. TAP Portugal also had different rules at different airports. For example: we were required to buy surgical masks as opposed to cloth masks after not having to wear them for several flights. This made flying extremely unreliable and I never knew what to expect. To make matters worse, the Portugal airport is completely incompetent. They don’t give gate information until 90mins before the flight takes off and you have to go through a passport check once receiving that information. This makes it so 100s of people are standing in a line angry and trying to rush to get to their gates because many were missing their flights. People were cutting in line which made other passengers mad. The passport checkers ended up having to calm people down and stop people from cutting in line which made the process twice as long. Also, the airport had several long escalators broken. This gets very frustrating while running through the airport with heavy bags or things like strollers. Overall I would not recommend TAP airline or the Portugal airport to anyone. It was an unbelievably frustrating experience that cost time and money in the end.

This review is for the return flight from Faro to Amsterdam. Check-in at Faro quick, but no lounge, which should have been communicated. Boarding on time and with priority for business passengers. TAP used its subsidiary Portugalia - on some flights - which does also offer a separate business class section (curtained off) but with 2-2 seating on the EMB-aircraft does not offer an empty seat between business seats. So although there seemed a bit more leg space, it was well below average business class seating, which is typically an empty seat between 2 seats or a seat blocked on the 2-seater row. Lovely and cheerful crew offering coffee, juice or water on the short hop to Lisbon. Lisbon Airport is hit or miss and seems disorganized, although a remote stand was announced, we docked at a gate, but ground staff was obviously unaware so it took a while to deplane. Quick visit to the TAP lounge that had moved from my last visit to a nice bright space with serviced bar and buffet. Lounge food was never very good here and again did disappoint, staff friendly and helpful, lounge clean with lots of attention for social distancing. Very early boarding call for the LIS to AMS leg. Extensive covid documentation check before boarding a bus to a remote stand. Portugalia's EMB 195 seems a have a bit more luxurious seats, nice cabin but the 2-2 seating in business class is a problem especially with economy class half empty (just move the curtain to have business class passengers be able to spread out, right?). Again a lovely crew, bar/dinner service combined and from a trolley. Here is where things go wrong. Obviously the EMB-aircraft don't have a sizeable oven, so only cold food. Despite an invite during booking from TAP to select my entree, no reference or explanation why it was just a cold platter and no choice. Very disappointing. The tray does not look bad and the food is fine, a bit heavy on meat and not very sophisticated. Staff kept offering refills even though I think I heard an automated announcement during boarding that alcohol would be limited. Flight on-time with early arrival in Amsterdam, but then accumulated a delay because of ridiculous taxi times at Schiphol and a slew of miscommunications in getting the plane to dock and disembark.

The total cost of the new flight is $100 less than the original flight, so you would think that I do not need to pay anything extra. However, they structured the new ticket in a deceiving way so that even though the ticket is cheaper, you still end up paying more. Here is how. My original ticket was made up of around $600 base fare and $50 airline surcharge. The new ticket is $250 base fare and $300 airline surcharge. This means that the new base fare ($250) is covered by what I originally paid ($600), but I now have to pay $250 extra to make up the difference in the airline surcharges ($50 vs 300). Also another $50 in taxes/fees, bringing the total to $300 extra, to change to a cheaper flight. This is completely deceiving and dishonest. They intentionally offered ""free changes"" and then jacked up the airline surcharge and decreased the base fare so that customers would still have to pay to change their flight. How did I find this out? It is not written anywhere explicitly. I spent over 2 hours waiting to speak to someone on the phone, and when I finally got someone, she gave me a vague response about the base fare needing to be equal or higher. This obviously does not sufficiently explain what's really going on, but she kept repeating this and provided no other explanation. She never once mentioned the significant airline surcharge increase. Only after comparing the cost breakdown of the two flights myself, I found where the $300 discrepancy came from. When I questioned the 600% jump in airline surcharge fees, she simply answered that it fluctuates and can happen.

"""dishonest airline decides to cancel your booking""",1,2021-09-12,"Not Verified |  The fares are low and it’s tempting, but don’t do it. I booked a round trip flight but was informed the evening before the first flight that the schedule had been changed. The proposed new flight had a 10+ hour layover and a post-midnight arrival time, but the email from TAP included a “Confirm or Change Flights” link. The link offers the option to change both the departing and return flights free of charge. I changed the departing flight that night, but, a few days later, checked to see if it was still possible to change the return flight, and it was. The website clearly stated that the cost of the change was “€0,00” and even included a message noting that “changes to this journey are free of charge.” I decided to push my return flight back a few days. The change was confirmed on the website and was viewable under my bookings. Fast forward to the night before this rescheduled flight, when I have not received a check in email. Finding that odd, I logged into my TAP account to find that the return booking - which had been viewable one day prior - did not exist. I attempted to call the helpline and was greeted with an automated message letting me know that “customer service is available starting at 8am” before disconnecting. It was within the hours of operation listed on the website, but I guess they don’t follow those. At the airport, I arrive first at the check-in desk, at which the attendant tells me that he can see the return flight date change, but that I must collect a new ticket at the airline ticket desk. I arrive at the ticket desk and am told that the booking doesn’t actually exist because it was cancelled by TAP on the same day the change was made. So I’m left without the return flight I had paid for in my initial booking and changed, via TAP’s link, a few days earlier. I call the TAP customer support line again and receiving the same auto message (it’s 9:30am local time). I soon learn why TAP gives this bogus number: they want you to call the toll line. So I call, and after about half an hour, I speak to a nice representative who promises to confirm a new booking for later that day and transfers me to the ticket change desk. The ticket change desk picks up the phone after 45 minutes, and I speak to someone from TAP’s equivalent of the Politburo, who informs me that the booking does not exist, but I can pay $1000 for a new one. I explain that I’ve already booked a round trip ticket, that I changed it on the link provided by TAP, and that I am happy to pay the usual change fee (a ridiculous $270, but I digress). At this point the TAP agent’s logic changes: she tells me the flight change wasn’t supposed to be free, so when I booked it on TAP's website it didn’t process, and the confirmation message I received after changing it was a fluke. When I was a “no-show” for the original flight - for which I never received a check-in email - the journey auto-cancelled. This is different from what the ticket office told me - that the flight was cancelled by TAP immediately after the change request was submitted. Then, she begins to lecture me about not paying the change fee that TAP claimed didn’t exist - as if I’m the one being dishonest! So: fork over the extra $100 for Lufthansa or British Airways.

Eventually, after I pointed out multiple times what the current guidance from the UK is is and show them all the receipts I had including a bank statement, I was giving my boarding pass. As I am unable to climb stairs and I had requested handicap assistance for the flights. The route was from Ponta Delgada to Oporto, where I had reserved a hotel room for the rather long layover between both segments of the flight. My wheelchair attendant in Ponta delgada was wonderful and was the highlight of the trip. Once on board, the fun ended. The first segment was being flown by an A320neo with less legroom than either Ryanair or Wizzair, but at thrice the price. Add to the outrageous price the fact that there was no catering on board except items to buy at very high prices which was indeed disappointing. The cabin staff was very friendly on both segments and very attentive. However, the leg room was so tight and the seats were the new thin non reclining type. I mistakenly assumed that this was part of the a320neo kitting of the cabin, and hope that the flight from Porto to London Gatwick would be better. After a restful night at a hotel near the airport I arrived well ahead of my flight as sometimes when you request wheelchair assistance it takes a lot longer to be seen to. After checking in - this time without an argument from the desk - I was told where to wait for assistance. In due time young woman showed up with a wheelchair, talk me through security to passport control which was unstaffed at that time. There she rather unceremoniously dumped me and said she would be back in time for my flight to take me aboard the aircraft. She never returned. Wheelchair bound and unable to move easily, I was a captive of TAP Portugal and Porto airport. Boarding time came and went as I grew more and more nervous. Finally, 10 minutes after the gate was supposed to close, a man from the wheelchair assistance program often puffed up to me and apologised profusely as apparently I had just been forgotten somehow. He then explained that the flight had been delayed buy 25 minutes for unknown reasons and that I would still make the plane as he pushed me through the airport at breakneck speeds. I thanked him for his trouble and made the flight back on time. Much to my dismay, the A320 - this time not a neo - had exactly the same, torture seating as did the previous plane. Joy!

When I tried to check in on Thursday night through the TAP App, it mentioned that also my 1 August flight had been cancelled. I had not received a message by SMS or email.

"""the worst I’ve ever experienced""",1,2020-06-20,"To be honest, I’ve never flown with TAP Air Portugal because my flight with them was canceled due to COVID, but I have spent over 3 hours on the phone/on hold with them so far, which roughly translates to half of a trans-Atlantic flight, I suppose. And I feel that this time we’ve spent together is enough to justify this negative review. The long and short of it is, when I bought my tickets with TAP Air Portugal, I opted to pay an extra ~$100 for a refundable flight, and—despite that, and after waiting a month and a half—I still have not received my money back from them.  Even if you purchase a cancellable flight (again, for more money), canceling through the website only grants you a flight voucher (good for one year only). In order to request a cash refund, you need to call them (nowhere was this mentioned when I bought my ticket, by the way; I had to call them to figure out this nugget of information). The phone number listed for the airline in many places is no longer in service; there’s a different number you need to call. Each phone call requires 30-60 minutes of hold time. I’ve been randomly disconnected from these phone calls multiple times. Most damning, each time I call, I’ve been told contradictory information. When I called on May 2nd to cancel my flight and ask for a refund, I was told that my request was submitted. Awesome. When I called back on May 18th, wondering why I hadn’t received it yet, I was told (for the first time) that I should wait a month to expect my refund, so I would have it by June 2nd. Then, when I called after June 2nd, again wondering where my refund was, the rep I spoke to tried to inform me that I hadn’t requested the refund until the 18th (even though the previous rep had confirmed that I requested said refund on the 2nd). This new rep also told me that I should wait a month to a month and a half beyond May 18th for my refund. The one consistent across all the reps I’ve talked to is that they won’t lift a finger to provide me any extra information. I’ve requested email messages to confirm what we’ve discussed. I’ve requested reps’ extensions in case I get disconnected (see above). Nothing. Whenever I hang up with a rep, I have to rely on their word that the information they've provided me is accurate. And at this point, I have little faith in that. In short, their customer service is some of the worst I’ve ever experienced. I understand that COVID is probably making things difficult for them to provide refunds promptly.  However, I would be much more understanding if the company were open and transparent with me, instead of using misinformation as a delay tactic.

This reservation requirement is not standard practice among airlines (and we've flown at least 12 different airlines over the years with our bikes).

"""received no notification from TAP""",1,2019-07-10,"TAP was responsible for the worst travel experience I have had in 27 years of frequent flying. I was booked YYZ-LIS-CMN, all on TAP metal, purchased via an Aeroplan ticket (Air Canada’s frequent flyer program). The debacle began when TAP canceled its YYZ-LIS flight on 26 June. Since their mobile app clearly has not been updated since 1997, I received no notification from TAP about the cancelation (despite having enrolled in email and SMS updates) and only found out about the delay by proactively checking the flight status. I initially called Aeroplan to rebook me on an alternative routing because I had a (correct) premonition that TAP’s call centre agents would be useless. However, Aeroplan are only able to rebook if there are points tickets available, and for same-day travel this is naturally next to impossible. Ultimately, they advised me to call TAP. After waiting on hold for an infuriating 30 minutes, we finally reached an agent who advised us that due to the flight cancelation we would be reprotected on a new flight that TAP was “kind enough” to send the following day, departing at 6 pm. At our final destination in CMN, we were to start on a 7-day prepaid tour of Morocco, so a delay of 24h would be unacceptable. We explained this extenuating circumstance to the TAP agent and he did not even attempt to look for alternative routing. He simply said “sorry”, he would not even escalate to a supervisor. When he realized it was an Aeroplan ticket, he said he could not touch our tickets anyway and he would transfer us to the airline miles department. Ready to try anything at this point (even though it was not on TAP miles), we accepted the proposal. When the hostile Miles agent picked up, he made it clear that he could not assist since it was an Aeroplan, not a Miles&Go ticket. We asked to be transferred back to a main ticketing agent without a 30-minute queue, but of course he just shoved us back into the queue anyway. When we finally reached another agent, she was no more helpful. She drew the same conclusion that since it was an Aeroplan ticket, I ought to speak to the Miles&Go department, despite my pleas that she figure it out as Miles&Go could not help, she cut me off and transferred me anyway — making it clear that this is just a shameless tactic to deflect a difficult call and keep average handle times down. Ultimately Aeroplan agreed to rebook us on AC’s YYZ-LIS flight the same night and told me they did so because TAP had violated its passenger contract of carriage and refused to reprotect me on any flight — unbelievable. The next leg of my journey (LIS-CMN) was still on TAP metal. The AC agent in YYZ was unable to print boarding passes for that flight and advised we pick them up in LIS. When we arrived, the TAP debacle continued. There was not a single agent manning the TAP transfers desk in the international terminal, so we approached an agent at a boarding counter for a flight that had just closed. She was visibly annoyed that we asked for help but when we pointed out the deserted transfers desk she obliged. When she looked into the file, she found that we were not confirmed on the LIS-CMN leg! Her suggestion, naturally, was to call Aeroplan, who once again came to the rescue: they cited TAP as again having shirked their responsibilities to guarantee us on the second flight (whatever that means) and repurchased the two tickets out of pocket so we could be confirmed.

No entertainment on screens at all, not even route map, crew told me that TAP are not allowed to have any IFE on European routes? Major problem was booking economy flights (not cheap) then purchasing specific seats, purchasing baggage and then bidding for a business class upgrade on the TAP website. Bids both outbound and inbound were accepted but whereas TAP provide for free seat reservations and baggage in Executive Class, they refused to give me a refund for either seats or baggage after my upgrade bids were accepted - they said I could transfer my seat reservation fees to another TAP flight within 12 months. TAP relied on rather vague general terms and conditions, stating that the fare rules of the class you purchased apply even in the event of an upgrade, to refuse a refund. Pretty poor since those T&C's generally relate to itinerary changes/cancellations/pax changes etc. Seems TAP are happy to accept lots of paid add ons to a basic fare and then refuse to accept that the bid for a successful upgrade should cancel all of this out and a refund given. I'm not a frequent flyer with TAP and will be even less frequent after this pretty shabby experience. Once bitten, twice shy, I'd never book seats or baggage again if I was going to bid for Executive Class, but probably not on this route and I'm unlikely to want to fly with them long haul.

"""TAP Portugal has been an absolute disaster""",1,2019-06-19,"This was an international flight and what was supposed to be a enjoyable vacation with my girlfriend turned into a nightmare within the first 24 hours. The flight was scheduled to depart from Miami on Friday and arrive in Madrid at 8.35 am, with a layover in Lisbon. According to the pilot, although we were boarded and on the plane in Miami at the correct time, we were delayed about 45 minutes because we were “waiting for a flight plan”. Mind you, the plane was originally scheduled to land in Lisbon in the morning at 5.20 am, with the connecting flight to Madrid leaving only an hour later at 6.20 am. Even without the delay, it would have been damn near impossible to get to that connecting flight before they closed the doors. We had to exit the plane outside of a gate and catch a bus to the terminal, then go through passport check and then go through another round of security. There was no way we would have been able to get through that in time to make the flight, so therefore they sold us an impossible connecting flight. Do not purchase a ticket with a connecting flight with TAP Portugal. Even 30 minutes before we arrived, we politely spoke to flight attendants about our situation and asked if people catching that flight to Madrid could exit the plane first in order to make it on time. The flight attendants were rude and replied that we would have to deal with that problem with the airport employees when we land. Once we landed, because of the delay, there was no time to get to our connecting flight and there were several others (and I mean several as in 20+) on the same plane that also missed their connecting flights, causing a chaos upon arrival of people scrambling to get flights changed. It wasn’t until 8.50 am, 3 hours after landing, that we were serviced and put on a new flight to Madrid. Let me also inform you that we had scheduled and bought a non-refundable, non-exchangable train ride from Madrid at 3.30, which cost us $200. The plan was to spend the morning in Madrid and then head to Barcelona that afternoon. The agent was able to give us a new flight to Madrid, however it was boarding when she informed us this was going to be our new flight so we had to run across the terminal to catch the flight! Before we ran to our gate, we asked the agent if our bags were going to make it and she replied “Yes they will.” We asked her if she was sure and she replied “Yes. I am working on that now.” So we get on the 9.20 flight only to get to Madrid and find out that our bags did not make it on board. Our checked bags had all of our clothing and toiletries inside so now we’re in a foreign country with nothing but the clothes on our backs and our personal items which only contained things like electronics and school work (me and my girlfriend are students). At this point my girlfriend is crying and we are only informed that our bags may get delivered to our hotel. There was no promise on when nor whether it would actually happen, leaving us anxious. Traveling with TAP Portugal has been an absolute disaster and it was my girlfriend's first time traveling overseas.

We were one of the first to arrive in the airport, and joined what it seemed to be a small queue (which became huge after half an hour) as there was only 2 TAP attendants to reschedule everyone's flights.

We called customer services in the UK and they offered us a route back to London with 3 connection flights, including a sleep over and 6+ hours of delay on our arrival, which was not an option for us. Seeking for an alternative, my husband approached Air Europa on a booth just next to TAP and they said they still had a considerable amount of seats available on their next flight to London, which was due to leave Salvador within the next 60'. They mentioned TAP could relocate us, and other passengers to this flight, but unfortunately, with only 2 staff available, TAP wasn't being able to actually process the relocations. Air Europa checkin would close within the next 20' and so we had to make a decision fast. We waited for another 10 minute, there was still 5 people in front of us at the queue and so we decided to purchase two seats with Air Europa, paying from our pocket. The family that was just in front of us on the queue said they could not afford so buy tickets for the whole family and so they waited in the queue. They told us later that when their turn finally arrived, they mentioned the Air Europa flight and were issued the tickets but, unfortunately not quick enough as as soon as they got their tickets in hands the checkin had already been closed. Air Europa flight was fairly empty and I wonder how many people TAP could have put in that flight if they had been more efficient. Arriving in London we made a claim through TAP's website for compensation (€600). After a few weeks we heard back from TAP asking for us to provide our personal and bank documents so they could process the payment, which we did straight away. On November 15 we received an email confirming they would proceed with payment, according to the Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, but since then we haven't heard back from them (nor have received any compensation).

"""tense and unpleasant atmosphere throughout""",1,2019-02-20,"I normally fly AF/KL/DL but TAP had a convenient schedule and on the MIA-LIS sector, I was able to join two colleagues who were booked on that sector. I booked a VGML and was told by the call centre that special meals could not be booked on intra-European flights, even in business class. TAP, to my knowledge, is the only European legacy carrier not to offer this basic service to its premium customers. Once onboard, the breakfast served were two slices of grey-ish meat and 2 slices of sweaty cheese which had obviously been left unrefrigerated overnight onboard (the Purser confirmed TAP only gets catered in LIS for this flight and that the catering arrives the previous day and remains onboard). A croissant was then given, and it was mouldy. I returned everything untouched. We arrived in Lisbon on a remote stand and there was no separate bus for Premium passengers. I made my way to the non-Schengen area where all TAP long-haul flights depart from, and walked around to try to locate the business class lounge. After 20 minutes of looking, a staff member told me that the lounge was in the Schengen area. Seeing how enormous the queues were to get back to the non-Schengen terminal earlier I decided to head to the gate directly as by now there were only 30 minutes left to board. I sat at the gate and observed how the boarding time came and went. The TAP app still said “on-time” even though the departure time had passed, and no word from the gate agents until H+10, when someone at the gate said that due to late crew, boarding was delayed indefinitely. We departed 2 hours late and the Captain apologised, saying that two crew members were late due to a traffic accident on the way to the airport and we had to wait for them. Are there no stand-by crew at TAP's main hub? The aircraft was a run-down A330-300 with a business class straight out of 1995. Slanted seats, yellowing walls, dirty toilets and unresponsive seat controls. The meal was slightly better than on the first sector, but outside of meal service, not a single crew member came out with a drinks tray. We arrived 2 hours late in Miami but at least my bags arrived promptly. I called TAP's US call centre about my poor experience and they assured me that my return flight from MIA to LIS would be vastly improved as it was to be operated by a A330-200 with the new business class. I logged on to my account and saw that indeed, the configuration was different and looked more spacious and I had been re-assigned to a single-throne seat. The day before the flight, I checked in online and to my horror, I saw that the plane had been reverted to the same substandard A330-300 I had on LIS-MIA. Needless to say I was unable to sleep on that night flight and my seat had been re-assigned several rows away from my colleagues. Several passengers complained to the crew and I must say they handled it the best they could, but it made for a particularly tense and unpleasant atmosphere throughout the flight. I visited the lounge in LIS prior to my flight to TXL and it was jam-packed. Only one coffee machine worked. The area to the right of the lounge, a semi-circular row of designer seats was filthy with each seat heavily stained. I could not believe this was a new lounge at TAP´s flagship airport.

Onboard the plane the main issue for a tall passenger like me (I am 1.92m / 6' 3"") was the complete lack of legroom on TAP Portugal's A320 fleet. The seat pitch is very tight on these planes. Airline also forces all the passengers to keep their hand bags under the seat in front of them which adds up to the lack of space (they were very strict about the policy). Sitting in an extremely tight space with absolutely no possibility to move my feet for nearly 5 hours was pure torture for me. On the other hand people with large hand luggage were allowed to use the overhead compartments leaving more legroom for their feet. This means traveling light is not advised on this airline. No IFE of any kind available. Both flights were on time and the food served on the second leg (the first leg was short so no food service really needed) was ok.

The price difference between Ryan Air and Tap was 100% +-> Tap is 2x++ the Ryanair price. My flight was delayed by > 1 hour, I did not make my connecting flight. TAP Portugal knew of the delay when I checked in, did not communicate it and could have booked me on a flight to Lisbon 10 minutes later than my scheduled departure, which flight left on time and I would have made my connection. However it did not - nor did it communicate the delay until the last minute - we stood for 25 minutes in boarding bridge after the plane had been cleaned and fueled - why was that. In the end I had a 7 hour layover in Lisbon and arrived at an hour that my family cannot pick me up and incur a 50 euro or more cab fare. A little bit of foresight and this could have been avoided. When I asked the TAP Portugal crew if those with connections might be allowed to disembark ahead of the others (which I have found to be quite common in my travels) I was met with blank stares. I also do not understand how we disembark from the rear when the premium and business seats are at the front - go figure - you pay more and you get off the plane later?? When I asked for Tap for assistance in Lisbon with transportation at the transfer counter - same poor response - as in this is “my” problem. Lastly the only snack served on the flight was an ice cream covered with nuts. I have seen the commentary on those with a lactose intolerance and vegetarians - I have a serious nut allergy. That I or others might be allergic to nuts seemed to come as a complete surprise to the crew. In a competitive world where customer service is important, I am sorry to say that TAP Portugal lags very far behind. I have never been prompted to write an airline review. However the service was so mediocre that I thought I should chime in.",True,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Porto to Faro via Lisbon,October 2018,3,1,,2,1,,False,

Nevertheless, in some case, they don’t have much time which is understandable. So i asked them to contact the person that was seated to my seat after me, but they didn't want to help me and they hanged the phone.

Well, I was shocked when I realised that on the flight London/Lisbon and back they don’t provide food for vegetarians (and they hadn’t run out). It’s a 2.5 hours flight but there is no food available for vegetarians. Not even a bag of crisps. Not even for sale. The only option available is a chicken seeded roll. This means that all the people that are allergic to nuts are not provided with food either. And again, the sandwich contains cheese,  people who are allergic to dairy are left with no food either.

TAP failed completely in providing us with meals and refreshments in a reasonable relation to the waiting time. On April 13, I was informed at the check-in, lest than hours before departure, that my flight was cancelled. All passengers waited until midnight to be put on a bus and dispatched to various hotels. The hotel I ended staying at was slummys. In the meantime, I was not contacted by the airline to let me know what was going to happen next. On April 14, we were transported back to Dakar airport at 2pm where we found out that the rerouting had not been done yet. We got told to wait for the system to update the rerouting for all passengers. We were all supposed to board on the 5pm flight to Lisbon, but a dozen of passengers, including myself, were denied boarding despite the numerous seats available. TAP failed in offering free of charge two telephone calls, telex or fax messages, or e-mails.

I asked several times to receive the two free phone-calls but I was denied this assistance. TAP failed in providing us with meals and refreshments in a reasonable relation to the waiting time. During the six-hour wait, we were not given any food or water, despite our several requests and families waiting with young children.  TAP did not contact me in any way informing of the new flight/re-routing; not one email apologising for the cancellation or the inconvenience caused. We were forced to sit on the floor for 6 hours, with no access to the internet.  TAP failed to provide me with a rerouting to the final destination at the earliest opportunity or, if I prefer, at a later date. In effect, the only re-routing offered was extremely inconvenient as it was forcing me to fly 48 hours after the original flight, via Paris and Brussels, including another 7-hour waiting time at Brussels airport.

Upon arriving at Porto airport I filed a lost luggage complaint, which was marked as resolved closed by Groundforce the next day without ever delivering the bag to me - the camera tripod was however found and delivered. Hours of calling around did not get us anywhere - Groundforce says they cannot reopen the lost items ticket even though they made a mistake closing it and it is now TAP Air Portugal's responsibility. TAP Air Portugal initially refused any responsibility but eventually advised to make a complaint of the lost luggage - which we did. It turns out the airline does not proess these complaints, or it may take up to year to do so - during which time nobody is looking for the bag and it might end up sold in an auction before anyone even reads my complaint. Nobody at the airport will look for the bag without an open lost items case and nobody cares enough to reopen my case or open a new one and thus my bag seems to be lost forever because of the process and TAP Air Portugal's complete lack of interest towards customer satisfaction. I did not get my preordered vegetarian on the flight either - the cabin crew just said they were not informed such an order had been placed, although I was able to produce a confirmation from the airline stating it had. So their internal communication is a mess.

When the plane arrived the crew started boarding inmediately and it only took 10 minutes to fully board the plane, they did a superb job! After that the Captain announced that we had to stay at the gate for 10 more minutes because they were still loading the suitcases inside the plane, the ground services here in Madrid (groundforce) are terrible. After that we got another delay because the control tower changed the runway configuration of the airport, and that delayed the flight another 10 minutes and after that announcement I started to get a bit nervous because I was worried about missing my connecting flight to Geneva. Then we took off and the snack sevice started, it was amazing to have a snack and a choice of drink on a 50 minute flight! Also the cabin crew were fantastic and they were also very friendly. But I found an issue between the cabin crew and the passengers because most of the passengers were Spanish and not one of the cabin crew spoke Spanish. Then we arrived in Lisbon and we had a bus transfer to the terminal because Lisbon doesn't have many jet bridges. After that I passed security and I ran to my gate because boarding had already started. After boarding everything went perfectly, the crew were friendly and helpful and thay did a great service during the flight, they served a light lunch that was decent and they served one beverage of choice (they also offered wine) and coffee/tea. The flight from Lisbon to Geneva departed ahead the scheduled time and arrived 30 minutes before scheduled! By the way the Embraer 195 was a very comfortable aircraft, the seats were wide and the aircraft was moedrn.

"""poor customer service""",1,2017-12-06,"New York to London via Lisbon. I fly between UK and US many times this year, with many different airlines such as American Airline, British Airline, Norwegian and the last flight was TAP Portugal. Really regretted choosing it and definitely will not recommend it for the following reasons. Watch out for allure price. I booked this through Chase Credit Card Reward website, the time/price seeems very good. Though very soon I found out it will charge money for even first piece of checked in luggage. Come on, international flight, who will charge that? Most company has first one free. Fine, I booked it and accepted this fact but very soon more angry problem occurs. It shows on their website if checked in online, the checked in luggage fee is $75. So I called them few days before the flight to put in the luggage request. The TAP customer service person took almost an hour to get this done due to system crash but assure me at the end this is put in. When I have my credit card ready for payment, the rep says I can pay at the airport during check in. I asked if there's any reference for this, the rep told me it's been put into my ticket number. Yet when I got to the airport, the checked in staff just told me I have to pay $90 because I did not pay in advance. I explained to them and ask them to check if any note put into the ticket in the system. They pretty much don't care and just told me they couldn't do anything about it. Since I have to go, did not bother to argue with them. After I landed on UK, I first called their customer service in Spain. The agent acknowledged they did see I call in prior to the check in, but refused to do any refund. The agent said their coworker may have mis-interpret the paid-in-advance term. Come on, your problem and I have to take the loss? She then told me I can fill up online complaint form. I did that on Nov 22th, receive an auto response email saying the complaint is received, then no update at all. Very poor customer service and system handling, and don't seem to care about reputation. During check in, if you want to change seat, any other seat will incur payment whereas most airline there's usually few seats one can interchange without additional fee.

Even the airport employee was surprised by this new scheme that he had to call TAP to confirm I was actually being charged this for one checked bag across the Atlantic. There is a new ‘Discounted Ticket’ price was just launched a few months ago by TAP to get more money out of their customers. If you are booking your ticket with any 3rd party you will never know that you are getting this ‘Discounted Ticket’ type since 3rd parties leave it on you to find out the baggage policies. I’ve also learned that TAP hides the ticket type from you online, the only way to find out what type of ticket you have is my waiting on the phone for long wait times and asking on of their representatives. I feel scammed out of my money and am very surprised TAP thinks that this is an intelligent business model, as I’m guess they receive many calls a day about this issue.

Firstly the Customer service queue: not their problem, then to a check in desk: not their problem, then another desk, where they just told us to go away, they couldn't help us until later in the day. They didn't rebook our flights and told us to come back at 11 am with the possibility of a flight the next day (after waiting for 4 hours in these queues). In addition, the Head of Customer services was angry and shouted at all the UK travellers in a most unpleasant way. Finally, after pushing them to do something, we were rebooked on a ridiculous Lufthansa flight via Frankfurt to London, where we couldn't make the 15 minute connection, changing terminals at Frankfurt and missed it! The Lufthansa staff were actually lovely and helpful, and said we shouldn't have been rebooked onto that flight, as the gap between them was less than 40 minutes. My husband ended up driving from Manchester to London (9 hour round trip) to pick us up. Just to add insult to injury, they don't respond to requests for EU compensation so they force their customers to go through the Aviation ADR in order to claim any compensation one is entitled to, AKA Ryanair.

When you are travelling for business purposes, meant to be presenting the next day and have no luggage with you, it does not bode well. To make matters worse, the bag was not delivered to me, I had to go and pick it up at the local airport at 10pm, 2 days after. This is after spending 3 hours (9:45pm-12:45am), trying to sort out where my bag had ended up, because the ticket attendant who checked in my bag did not put the baggage number on my ticket. Cue in running around a foreign airport, trying to find TAP staff who were still working past 11 at night, in order to obtain the baggage number and then take that to the delayed / lost baggage office. I therefore knew, with the return flight being an hour late, that I would have the same problem. After waiting 25 minutes by the baggage carousel, I filed a delayed/lost baggage claim. The man at the GBS counter tried to tell me that there were no messages on his system and therefore I should wait it out. I politely but firmly had to tell the guy that this same thing had occurred before and I am not prepared to wait 3 hours (again) in an airport. Having filed the report, I received an email acknowledging the delayed bag. 12 hours later a second email came through, informing me that my bag had been located and will be put on the plane the next morning. So it never left from its transfer location once again. In addition, an airline which does not provide in-flight entertainment for flights longer than 4 hours, needs a serious review.

I called Travelocity who called American. American said the ticket was issued and everything was good to go. I called TAP because I wanted to make sure she wouldn't be stranded, and they said they had cancelled the ticket and ""no, it's not our problem"". When I pressed them for a reason they transferred me to someone else who told me that American had reissued the ticket ""incorrectly"". And they would continue to cancel it until it was issued correctly. I had to press him to tell what was incorrect about the issuing of the ticket. It turns out it is because the ticket was issued from initially from Indianapolis to Geneva and the reissue had been from Miami to Geneva.

I was happy to find a flight under $500 rt from Miami to London, so I booked with TAP Portugal despite never having flown with them before. The trip to London (via Lisbon) was long and draining, but not terrible. The trip back, however, was something I would not wish to relive. First, although I could choose my seat on the legs to Europe, policy had apparently changed during the week that I spent in London, so I was unable to choose my seat for the way home without paying 30 GBP. When I called to complain about this policy change, I was basically told too bad, so sad. I went ahead and paid the fee, because of course my assigned seat was in the middle of a 4-person row for the long-haul flight. This was even more infuriating when I realized that the plane was maybe 1/3 to 1/2 full and most people seemed to have a full row to spread out in (I did not, as more people were assigned to my row, leaving only one empty seat). The woman in front of me immediately slammed her seat back as far as it would go. I'm only 5'3"" and never have problems with leg room on planes, but her head was basically in my lap the entire nine hours. To top it off, the way the television screen was situated, it was now about 3"" in front of my nose, which made reading, eating, or doing anything pretty much impossible. The flight attendants offered two meals and two drinks throughout long flight. I did call a couple of times for additional beverages, which I got.

I would have liked to have been able to charge my phone. On the way to Europe, there was a good entertainment system with dozens of movies and television shows to watch in both English and Portuguese, but on the way home, there were 6 movies offered at any given time, and none were anything I was remotely interested in. The experience in Lisbon airport was a disaster, but I believe that was more the airport's issue and not the fault of TAP Portugal. Overall, you get what you pay for. It was worth it to deal with the nonsense to be able to go to London; if I had not found a cheap flight, I probably wouldn't have gone.

Landed in Lisbon the connection flight was missed as expected. Not 1 person from TAP able to provide any kind of explanation or resolution. Moved to transfers. Moved into 3 different queues. About 50 people including children and elderly. No drinks, seats, any other comfort to alleviate the almost 6 hours of queues and waits. Fragmented information and always different every 15 minutes. In the end (around 5 pm local time) I found out I would be rerouted the day after to Paris and then to Nice by Air France (a mandatory choice, no way to negotiate it). Told I have to pick up my luggage in Paris the day after with only 1 hr to connect and having to get a new boarding pass at the Air France desks. Moved to hotel without luggage. Wake-up at 4 am. Moved again to airport. When asked TAP about picking up luggage in Paris the situation changed and no pickup required, luggage will go to Nice directly. When I asked for baggage tags incase of problems I was told ""you have to trust TAP"". This is my first time with TAP because of its membership to Star Alliance.

"""certainly not choose TAP myself""",3,2016-08-13,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Rio de Janeiro via Lisbon. Outbound first sector on A319 fine. Good meal with well-cooked grouper as a main. Pretty impressive for short haul. Unfortunately this was as good as it got. Discovered that no lounge airside after passport control in Lisbon, so had nearly two hours to wait in main terminal building. Boarding somewhat chaotic - aircraft to Rio an ageing A340. Cabin crew not very welcoming and the leather gloves the females wear make them appear as if they are about to strangle someone rather than provide a service of hospitality. Seat format is 2-2-2. I had chosen a central seat several weeks before in order to have as much sleep as possible and neither disturb a neighbour, nor be disturbed by one. Having settled into my seat, I was staggered when the purser called at me across the aisle to ask if I spoke English, and pressured me to move, asking loudly in front of a couple who wanted to sit together - one of them in my seat. (If somebody had a medical need, it would be a different matter. Similarly if there was a genuine requirement on the part of the operating crew. That was not the case here. They had simply not organised themselves in time.) I was therefore obliged to sit in a seat I did not wish to be in throughout the flight. My fear of being disturbed by the new seating arrangement was realised. A member of the cabin crew leant over me throughout dinner service to serve my neighbour- constantly bashing the side of my seat and speaking extremely loudly over the top of me as I tried to rest. Once the dinner service was over, managed to get some sleep; served a cold breakfast of cold cuts and cheese shortly before landing. Return on a more modern A330. First appearances can be deceptive. Although newer, this is about the least passenger- friendly business class I've flown in for at least five years. The cabin is extremely open, giving virtually no privacy - the screen between neighbours provides no barrier at all. The seat pods are very low, with tv screens at knee height - not comfortable to watch a film. There's nowhere to stow belongings. On an overnight flight this is particularly frustrating. The seat does not fully recline, meaning I spent the entire flight slipping down towards the footwell. At the end of a 10 hour flight there was no hot breakfast - especially poor given many pax will skip dinner on a 2300 take off. The cold meats were OK but one slab of cheese and one chunk of mango is not great catering. IFE was turned off fully 35 minutes before landing. Quite staggering when so many other airlines allow you to watch/listen virtually until the doors are open. And especially frustrating when having selected a film to watch knowing it would finish 20 minutes before landing, and being deprived of the end. Having learnt my lesson on the outbound, went through passport control so I could access the lounge for my 3 hour layover. Discovered it was not run by TAP (no lounge in their own capital city - very poor) and had to pay €15 for a shower. Distinctly unimpressed on a flight costing more than €4000. No hot food in the lounge either. Final sector to London on A319. Mid afternoon so no hot food there. Result - 18 hours in TAP's ""care"" as a business passenger with only cold cuts and sandwiches on offer. Cabin crew on both return sectors were OK. All sectors on time.

On the first long-haul journey, the flight attendants had no record whatsoever of me choosing a vegetarian meal option despite me being able to produce a screenshot of my selection, and consequently they were unable to provide me with any food on the seven hour flight. Incredibly, I was told it was my fault for not confirming at check-in that I had chosen a vegetarian meal. The flight attendant stressed that on the way back from New York, I should confirm my meal choice when dropping my luggage during check-in. It's worth noting that on the shorter three-hour flight from London Heathrow to Lisbon, there was also no vegetarian food on offer – only a Turkey sandwich. So far I had spent more than nine hours in the air with TAP Portugal without any food. Nine days later, I confirmed my vegetarian meal choice while checking in at JFK, as requested by the rude and unhelpful flight attendant. The man at TAP's check-in desk said he had no record of me choosing a vegetarian meal option online but assured me that TAP would definitely have a vegetarian pasta option on board. Once again, however, the only meal available on this flight was chicken and once again, the only option on TAP's shorter journey from Lisbon to London was a Turkey sandwich.

When they offered me a flight 8 hours later that went via two Brazilian cities in Northeastern Brazil and would only get two days later to Rio, I proposed several times, if they couldnt let me on another plane the next day or even the day after that or, even better, let me fly via Sao Paulo since I really didnt have to get to Rio and would lose my connecting flight to Curitiba anyway. They insisted there were no seats. When I called my travel agency they told me there were free seats only in a more expensive category (I guess in Premium Economy or Business Class). I repeatedly asked for help and directed myself to several employees. Several of them didn't even speak proper English. I was a little nervous since I didn't see myself getting to Brazil on time when my job there started two days later.

She stared at her monitor, clicking several things for about 10 minutes not saying anything. Finally, she looked up and said: We have got it. Your flight leaves in about 45 minutes. It goes to Sao Paulo. From there I booked you a flight to Curitiba. I also have you luggage in Rio sent to Curitiba. Of course, I was incredibly grateful to this lady and very much relieved. (even though in Sao Paulo, I had literally 5 minutes to change flights and almost lost the connecting flight and my luggage got to Curitiba only two days later).

It started two days before our return flight when we received an email telling us we could check in. We tried to do so but the system asked us to verify passport details for the first passenger. Having done this, it confirmed the details were saved but didn't let us proceed. There was no error message at all but absolutely no means of progressing to do the same for the other passenger and complete the check in. We tried five or six times and then decided it would be best to call. The TAP website is extremely poorly laid out and it is very hard to find usable contact numbers - like many companies these days, they do their level best to avoid having to actually speak to you. But we searched the web and found a number. Eventually someone did answer but told us she couldn't help us and instead directed us to another number, which was either manned by dead people or they were on a very long tea break because it rang incessantly, giving no indication at any stage that we were even in a queue. After a 20 minute wait (calling the UK as we gave up on the local Brazil call centre, and so at a probable cost of at least £1 per minute), the call was answered and after a lengthy explanation as to our problem and an interminable period on hold, the lady confirmed she had amended the system and we could now complete the process! At the airport, a relatively short queue took an age to process as the check in staff seemed to be on a go-slow. Everything was so incredibly inefficient.

At the airport, we tried to check in on one of the self service kiosks that most airines unhelpfully force you to use. This too did not work so we asked a member of staff who tried it and also failed, and then directed us to the ticket desk. There, a surly woman who could not have looked more disinterested if she tried, briefly checked out our booking and informed us that our ticket agent (we did not book direct with TAP) had cancelled the original booking because the flight time had changed, but not successfully re-booked us on the earlier flight as we had requested some months before when the flight time change was notified to us. I asked the TAP ticket agent if she could make the change to which she replied no, I would have to ring the ticket agent.

Ok, no problem! If somebody needs to get to a hospital,I totally understand. I was expecting a short stop of about an hour or so. We landed, the ambulance took the ill passenger and after 35 minutes everything was over.

TAP Portugal customer review,1,2015-07-02,"TAP are charging shockingly high business class prices on their route from Lisbon to Sao Tome. The flight time via Acra is almost 7 hours and in my ignorance and bearing in mind we paid more than £2000 per seat I thought I would get something approaching reasonable seats and service. TAP are using A320's on the route in European configuration. This means that business has little or no more leg room the only benefit being that the middle row of three is not filled. They maintain that the seats are wider but on both our flights were not. This may be OK for a 2 hour business class route in Europe but not on a long haul flight like this at the prices that are being charged. The service was lacklustre and staff seemed to have little interest, the food was OK but inadequate for such a long flight and I arrived at the end of the SAO-LIS tired, hungry and feeling that I had been badly ripped off. I appreciate that an aircraft the size of an A320 is ideal for this route but there is no reason why TAP cannot invest in re-configuring the aircraft into a more suitable layout. BA for example use the same aircraft on a 5 hours plus run to Beirut yet have proper business class sleep seats at the front of the aircraft. If they really cannot do this then charge a small supplement but do not con passengers into thinking they are getting good comfort and service. This is one of the worst airline experiences in relation to value I have had and frankly would have rather flown Ryanair. From the moment we checked in in Lisbon the approach was lackluster. It just got worse from there.",False,Airbus A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Sao Tome to London via LIsbon,June 2015,1,3,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",1,1,,False,1
TAP Portugal customer review,1,2015-06-26,"Operated by Portugalia, two very different stories. On the first leg, nice crew, good tasty sandwich and drink, old but good airplane which was clean, priority boarding with infants respected, all-in-all positive experience and would fly with them again. On the return leg, TAP Portugal's Porto ground staff decided to ruin my day. I am a Star Alliance silver member and should have had no issue with luggage. But for some reason they now told me that my two bags were overweight (30 instead of 23 kg) and that I had to pay 50 EUR each supplement to carry them to BRU, even though I had exactly the same amount of luggage going to OPO, this apparently did not matter. They even told me to go and buy another suitcase, they would be able to accept it free of charge if less than 23kg. Given the fact that I was traveling with three children one of which is a toddler not really an option. But even if, there are no suitcases for sale at OPO so would not have been an option anyway. Talking to the manager did not help either so had to pay. I was told I could complain in BRU but was also told that it would have no effect. That was true because in BRU there was no one even willing to register my complaint. I tried later through the internet but guess what, 3 weeks have passed and still no reply. As for the return flight itself, it was just as good as the one coming into OPO. So a real pity, a nice product but ruined by some ground staff in OPO and some very restrictive rules on luggage.

TAP Portugal customer review,2,2015-05-20,We travelled on TP931 from ZRH to LIS last Thursday. First negative impression came up when we approached the gate: instead of boarding 40 minutes prior to departure (which is quite a long time for ZRH where I fly nearly every two weeks) the boarding started only 15 minutes prior to the scheduled departure time. So instead of spending the time in the Swiss lounge (I am *G) we had to wait 25 minutes before getting access to an old A320 with really outdated seating. The leg space was non-existent (row 14) and even newspapers were old. The aircraft definitively has seen better times. FA's were very impolite and at one moment I was nearly disciplined for moving towards the rear door just to give way for a FA (I was waiting in front of the toilet when one FA came along the alley to the rear of the aircraft). No smiling and no kind words. There was only a small sandwich as meal for a 2.45 hours flight which I think is not adequate. I would expect that with a LCC but not with a Star Alliance member airline. Landing with more than 15 minutes delay in LIS we were rewarded with an apron position instead of a gate position. Of course there was not a single word of excuse from the crew a bad start into the weekend. On the way back we had booked in business class which was a little bit better in terms of seating and definitively better in terms of catering. However on that flight there were at least 15 OpUps into business (maybe less than 10 paid tickets) and we asked ourselves why did we bother to pay for it.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,False,

The flight from Lisbon to Natal was delayed for 3 hours with no explanation from the very impolite TAP staff. They rejected to answer and said to wait. Finally the aircraft was changed to a small and unknown Portuguese charter company named White. The plane was an old and heavily used A310 no entertainment and seats were not adjustable. The return two weeks later was again 4 hours delayed and flying back with the same old aircraft. Again staff were very unfriendly and seats were not working.

TAP Portugal customer review,3,2015-04-06,LIS-AMS on Jan 20 on an Airbus 320 in Business - straight forward morning point to point flight as part of an intercontinental itinerary. Flight was on time (and this is where the good things end) and Business Class was almost empty - Premium Check in at LIS with no lines but refused to check our luggage through to VIE on OS (both airlines are part of Star Alliance) as “they are not allowed to do this unless the connection is on TAP. Although we used two separate tickets this was never an issue before with other major airlines. I guess the agent just did not want to deal with it. As we had a longer layover in AMS it was not a real problem but inconvenient. Boarding was bizarre and the procedure just plain stupid. At first the flight was called for boarding 30 minutes before departure and people are asked to line up starting with pre-boarding for small children and the physically challenged. They were first in line. Then one gate agent goes through the line and tells everybody to stand in one of three new lines (based on class of service and seat number) once this is finished the gate agent starts to board line by line. However you are not allowed to actually board the plane but you have to stand in a new line at the gangway for further 10 minutes before the actual boarding of the plane commences. Basically everybody including families with small children and business class passengers had to stand in three different lines for 30 minutes before they were allowed to board the plane. Never seen such an atrocious boarding procedure before. Once on board service was very lacklustre and limited to the initial meal service and tax free sales. Other than that the female FA was in hiding mode behind the curtain. You could actually see her skipping through various magazines totally unconcerned with serving passengers. Also breakfast was a small plate of cold cuts and sub-par for an almost three hour business class flight. All in all a very disappointing flight especially as previous experiences with TP in Economy have been quite good. TP lounge is Lisbon is nice with good quality offerings both drink- and food wise but tends to get packed during busy times. I could not say that any aspect of the flight was in line with one expects from business class. No drama as TP got us to our destination on time but clearly not recommended as the experience was somewhere between mediocre (on board) and unpleasant (check-in and boarding) Definitely not good enough for business class prices.

TAP Portugal customer review,4,2015-04-01,GIG-OPO-LIS on Jan 18 GIG-OPO on an old Airbus 330-200 OPO-LIS on an A319 both legs in Business Class both flights on time with an easy transfer at OPO FA's were attentive and friendly and showed Portuguese hospitality on board. However the transatlantic flight was on an old Airbus 330-200 with angle flat seats in an old style 2-2-2 configuration that were not really that comfortable for sleeping and a vintage entertainment system from the 80s with bad screens showing a couple of films in a loop with even no way to finding out when a film actually starts. What was surprising was that the cabin actually did not look that old and quite fresh. No idea why TP kept the old style seats and the useless entertainment system when they freshened up the plane. Dinner served out of GIG was nicely presented and ok but not stellar. Canapés Smoked Trout (or two other choices) and soup for starters and Sautéed Seafood with Veggies (or Chicken with Lentils or Brazilian Style Dried Beef or Spinach Lasagne) for mains. Portuguese Wines served were good. However the limited cold breakfast (cold cuts and yoghurt) served before landing after such a long flight was definitely not adequate for Business Class. TP uses the Gol Lounge in GIG. While the lounge was comfortable the offerings available were in line with the discount character of Gol and disappointing. OPO-LIS was just a 30 minutes short hop with water served and actually no service to be expected for such a short flight. Most of the Business Class cabin was occupied by TP staff with paying Business Class passengers seated in middle seats while TP staff has been allocated bulkhead seats aisle seats etc. Just a short hop so tolerable but a weird mind set regarding customer orientation. Transfer and EU immigration in OPO fast and easy and shared lounge used by TP in OPO comfortable and nice. All in all a discount Business Class experience but not an unpleasant flight and on-time arrival. However flight to Brazil with LX was a much better experience. TP needs to retire or update these old planes to offer a really competitive transatlantic product. If available at a substantial discount I would not rule TP out for another long haul flight again.

They greeted us with a smile and a salute. It has improved since the last time I flew with TAP. On the first trip the board meal was a simple turkey or chicken ham sandwich rather plain. On the way back I had a delicious tuna sandwich. One of the best I ate on board. Both flights departed on schedule we even arrived earlier at Lisbon. Actually I was going to try AirTransavia for the first time but they changed my 9 am flight to 6.45 pm without much justification (which would make me completely waste my 1st day) so it cost me 35 Euros more but gave me a free meal free luggage and free cabin luggage.

Got a special meal and happy with friendly and attentive crew. Returning to London flight was also on time although I really dislike boarding a plane via the bus and this is something TAP needs to change. Normally we board via the arm but there was a Rio de Janeiro flight boarding in that gate so I guess those flights have priority. Again cabin crew was attentive and friendly.

TAP Portugal customer review,,2015-02-24,Flew TAP several times very rare to be on time. Flew with my family on 24 October 14. The flight was late no reason given when we arrived in Lisbon our car hire company could not be contacted. As we had two young children with us we took a taxi to our destination. Cost us 135 euros. The main problem that I had was the staff at the gate were very rude and off hand. They changed my seat telling me that someone had my seat despite the fact I had booked in on line two days prior to flying. When I got on the plane someone was sitting in the seat I had then been allocated. The steward made me go to the back of the plane while he sorted it out. I was then two rows in front of my family at no time was an apology made in fact I was made to feel it was my fault. When I got up during the flight to use the toilet I stood talking to my family there were several people standing up the same steward came up and demanded I sat down. He was very rude throughout the flight. Not sure if they have heard about customer service. On the plus side our return flight was on time and the staff that time were very good. I did email customer service when I got back in November but had no acknowledgement or apology.

Boarding was quick however cabin crew was not too interested with taking jackets and coats off the passengers. Smart and interesting safety demo. After take off absolutely nothing happened for 1 hr 27 minutes when crew decided to start their service! Not a welcome drink before take off not any drinks or even hot towels for almost 90 minutes. We had to go to the galley and ask for glass of water in business class while crew was having their food. This is something I never understand with TAP waiting sometimes up to two hours to start the service. Why? They did go through the cabin with duty free card but food and drinks were still not served. Finally menu arrived followed by meal which was nice and tasty except horrible pudding. Later crew disappeared for another 1.5 hrs.

TAP Portugal customer review,9,2015-01-14,Flew business from Lisbon to Recife return. On the way to Brazil we flew on the old A330 which wasn't too bad apart from the IFE which were very outdated and you had to basically follow the films on each channel as you could not pause them and there was a poor selection of films. The seats on the old A330 were quite good taking into consideration the aircraft's age - the only downside of the seats was that they didn't convert into flat- beds. On the way back to Lisbon we flew on one of the recently acquired A330's which had an upgraded IFE touchscreen and basically the same entertainment system of all other European airlines except from the fact that there were no options to watch the external camera - which for me isn't too much of a problem; the selection of films was quite good this time. Couldn't see too much of a difference from the old seats on the recent aircraft apart from a more modern design and the fact that it had a massage function and reclined 180 degrees but nothing compared to the seats on other airlines. Staff were quite friendly and always present (they would show up in less than one minute after pressing the button) - far too different than in economy. The food was indeed very good with a good selection of wines and main courses. On the way back from Brazil they served typical Brazilian dishes though breakfast was too simple for business class.

Excellent product by TP with food drinks allocated seats and checked luggage included in the ticket price. Fare was also very competitive. Below GBP 60.- a one-way including ridiculous UK departure taxes. Unfortunately TP uses a bus gate for this flight at both Gatwick and Portela but that just a very minor inconvenience. The only negative was that TP uses a pay-per-entry lounge (No. 1 Lounge) for its frequent travelers. The lounge was hopelessly overcrowded.

However to be fair the staff was particularly nice smiling caring and professional (usually not the case with TAP where staff are usually demotivated careless if not rude).,False,,,Business Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,False,

Onwards daylight flight to Brazil was not too crowded so was quite comfortable. Food was very good. Staff were friendly. Return night flight from Brazil to Lisbon was full and therefore very cramped.

TAP Portugal customer review,3,2014-10-31,I love Portugal and I wish I could provide a glowing report on TAP but they are going to have to up their game to survive. I travel a lot to Portugal as I have a house there - maybe 6 times per year. Most recent trip from London to Lisbon was delayed by 2.5 hours for a reason that was unclear and when I got on the plane I was redirected to seat 35A - which is the very back in the corner seat backing the loos. The seat I had chosen online was broken and could not be used. According to the official at Heathrow the TAP flight is delayed every night. I will fly BA or Easyjet in future even if it means an extra £50 or so return. Pity though the wine is good!,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,2,,False,
TAP Portugal customer review,1,2014-10-28,Travelled from Faro to Barcelona via Lisbon. Went to check in 2.5 hours prior and the flight to Lisbon was ok then the agent advised us our flight fro. Lisbon to Barcelona was overbooked and we were given standby boarding passes. We may get on our flight and we may not despite having confirmed seats 6 months ago! Our flight ex Faro was delayed so we missed the connection by 5 minutes. Went to the transfer desk where we were advised that 'we missed the flight' and the first available flight with seats was at 8pm. I understand that delays occur and missed connections but what peeves me most is that we had confirmed seats on the flight from Lisbon to Barcelona and checked in 5 hours before departure and from a connecting flight and yet we get bumped because TAP have a high 'overbooking profile' on their flights. Not happy as we have had to cancel dinner in Barcelona with friends as this is the reason why we were transiting there for 1 night on the way to Dubai.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,
TAP Portugal customer review,7,2014-10-28,"Flown with TAP twice in the last year LHR-LIS-LHR for xmas/new year and LGW-OPO-LGW in the summer. Arrived early at LHR with very long queues for check in at the old and tired T1 a delayed Funchal flight was causing chaos with the staff not knowing quite what was going on. I was told to use the ""self service"" check in machine which involved printing baggage tags but with no bag drop area I had to join the back of the queue anyway! Hopefully the move to T2 will resolve these issues. Process much smoother at LIS and very comfortable which is expected. No issues at all at LGW but a 1.5 hour delay at OPO left me twiddling my thumbs for a very long time (a nice airport but rather barren). Service and comfort on board (A320 Economy) both trips was fine although the food was fairly poor (small dry roll and fruit juice). Good selection of wine/beer but only one offering in ~2.5 hours. I will try BA for my next trip which is really the only other alternative on these routes.",False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,4,,True,
TAP Portugal customer review,,2014-10-20,"We have used TAP many times over the years to fly from London to Brazil via Lisbon. In June we made such a trip. On arriving at Lisbon from London Gatwick we were informed by TAP that the Lisbon - Recife flight was cancelled. No proper explanation Was given. We were stuck in Lisbon for (at least the night). Our flight from Lisbon to Recife eventually left the following morning (over 12 hours late). We effectively lost a day of our trip to Brazil. Return journey - having queued at Recife airport for more than 2 hours I was informed that my return flight to Lisbon was to be delayed by around 7 hours (it should have taken off at 11pm on the Friday evening - instead it was not going to take off before 6am the following morning). This meant that I would miss my connection from Lisbon which was on a Saturday at lunchtime. TAP's representatives told me they could not guarantee an alternative flight to London until the following Tuesday! TAP's eventual ""solution"" to the problem was to put me on a flight to RIO the following morning. I would then have to wait in Rio for 10 hours before taking a flight to London (Heathrow instead of Gatwick where I was supposed to arrive). I eventually arrived in London (at the wrong airport) a full day late. In my opinion appalling customer service.

TAP Portugal customer review,8,2014-10-13,Having read several unfavorable reviews on TAP I could not - honestly - recognize what was the problem. I flew CPH-LIS-Faro and return. CPH-LIS-CPH were all on time even a little behind schedule on the return flight. Effective check in and service onboard excellent. You were served a full hot meal breakfast to LIS was especially delicious. The internal flights with no service but it was just a 40 minutes flight so it was not expected. Slight delays on 5-10 minutes created absolutely no problems. All in all TAP is superior to other carriers from Denmark to Iberian peninsular far better than both SAS and Iberia where you have to pay for meals with poorer quality than on TAP.

Only thing to know - TAP serves medium haul destinations (Cape Verde Senegal Sao Tome Ghana Mali etc) with an A320 or similar without real business class seats.

VEN-LIS allocated club seat with economy service and food actually excellent duck pie followed by fresh pineapple and served with good red wine and water.

TAP Portugal customer review,1,2014-10-05,This airline is a constant disappointment. I've have flown LHR to Fortaleza and back from Recife this month with TAP in business class. Return home flight out of Brazil delayed 8 hours - from 2300 to 0700 next day. This is the second time TAP have cancelled and rebooked me on another flight the following day - I now have an extra layover in two cites - Recife and Lisbon making my return over 24 hours late. At no time did the airline contact me despite having emails and cell numbers. I have made several calls to get some answers on my rebooking. In the past month two colleagues who have also been in Brazil for work have been delayed on way home by 24 hours on both these routes given appalling hotels as an alternative and little compensation.

The Lisbon TAP lounge is before passport control so if you are connecting in Lisbon all you need is trying to find it! As a frequent flyer I always try and find things. It is not that difficult. Anyway I have flown them on several occasions and in short haul they are the almost only ones serving food and wine in economy!

TAP Portugal customer review,,2014-09-10,We took a TAP flight back in June from EWR to LIS. The airline called at 9am to let us know (without reason) that our scheduled 7pm flight would be delayed about 5 hours - that is 10 hours before scheduled flight time! Could they not have re-routed another plane? The flight was actually delayed 7 hours. Additionally we were traveling with 1 baby and a 2 year old. They seated our 2 year old in a different row from us and made no effort to change seating so we could be together. We had to ask other passengers to switch seats so that we could sit together as a family. We also brought our car seat with us and none of the staff had the correct knowledge of what the proper handling regulations were for the seat - we were told different things by the customer service rep the check-in agent and the flight attendants.

TAP Portugal customer review,,2014-09-01,To be honest I flew with them 3-4 years ago and I don't remember having any issues. But this time I made the mistake not to check online reviews before booking a surprisingly cheap flight. Never again! I have to agree with previous reviews: atrocious customer service. The desk and cabin personnel are either given instructions or trained to mistreat customers. On 30th August the situation in Lisbon airport throughout the whole day (yes a 1.5 hours connection that turned into a 13 hours wait) where: over two thirds of TAP flights were delayed (ranging from 1 to 6 hours with delays going up and down all the time). The line at the transfers desk (Lisbon their base where they should have no shortage of personnel) was always over 1.5 hours and 2 or 4 times more at times.

TAP Portugal customer review,,2014-08-28,I flew LHR-LIS for a 9 day holidays. The flight was delayed by 3 hours due to severe weather. Instead of keeping us in the lounge they kept us on the plane for 2 hours. Cabin crew had no interest in explaining us the passengers that due to unforeseen circumstances the flight would be delayed.

This very poor and nearly non-existent rating is mentioned for Windrose (a Ukrainian company working with TAP). I have no words for describing this very bad flight. To be honest if the flight back from Fortaleza to Lisbon two weeks later had not been very good (we were sitting in a new airplane with TV-Entertainment good service and enough space for your legs) I would never fly TAP again. The aircraft (Windrose) was an old A330. It had no entertainment system. Many seats were broken and people had to change place in a mostly full airplane. The Windrose crew were not very friendly and seemed to be very stressed. I felt quite sorry for them and they should not be blamed for anything. The service was bad and very poor. The service for drinks was just twice on a 7-hours flight. This is a real disgrace for the TAP company selling such a bad product and we felt quite betrayed.

TAP Portugal customer review,,2014-08-20,Had a two leg journey on TAP: Lisbon - Dakar June 25. At check-in in Helsinki was informed that the flight will be delayed for at least 3 hours. It ended up being delayed 8 hours and no representative was available to assist at the gate until much later - a 10 euro food coupon was issued! No talk of being sent to a hotel while waiting. As a result of this delay I arrived in Lisbon at 2.30 am local time and despite assurances no-one met the arrivals who were transferring to other flights until several hours later. An agent shuffled various new flight coupons but there were none for our family. Obviously we had missed the continuing TAP flight hours before bound for Dakar. Now at Lisbon airport no hotel room was available and we were not allowed access to a lounge either. We were each given a breakfast and lunch coupon and I was given phone cards as I had no way of communicating to Dakar that we were delayed. My family ended up spending an entire day at the airport and the next flight to Dakar moreover took off 2 hours later than scheduled.

All our baggage was on the plane. Our daughter counted at least 5 empty seats on the plane one next to her. Only offer from TAP was to make flights to Algiers Geneva Nice then Heathrow - taking over 24 hours. Manager refused to come and see us. TAP staff eventually gave up trying to resolve issue and left us to find solution with TAP staff in departures. Spent two hours with them they arranged overnight hotel and taxi transfers.

We travelled in a party of 4 checked in the previous night online and printed off luggage tags and boarding passes at the kiosk at the airport making the whole process very quick as all that was left was luggage drop-off and security.

Put up in local airport hotel but forced to leave hotel at 2am to check in. Checking in at the hotel for a 4 hour stay took ages as each customer had to fill in a form. Not acceptable in any way and no TAP rep to help. Old plane from Rio worst legroom on long haul ever experienced and food (chicken?) was very dried out. IFE ancient. Most screens on a 10 hour flight did not work and those that did showed rolling programme of a few channels for which there was no info. At check-in at Rio we had been allocated a rearranged flight for Lisbon departure of 18.50 which was impossible to make and quite predictably the gates for this flight had closed as we arrived at Lisbon. No other flight was available until 10.10 the following morning. Another airport hotel which was reasonable. TAP insisted on 7am pickup. Queued at TAP customer services at 7.30 am to get a voucher for breakfast which at first they very strongly and rudely refused. We were told that we would get a sandwich on the plane to London at 11am. After a very heated discussion a voucher was grudgingly given for 6 Euros!

TAP Portugal customer review,3,2014-08-03,TAP Portugal recently opened a direct route between Lisbon and Tallinn the capital of Estonia and we took the chance to visit Lisbon because of the fantastic prices they were offering. I'm at a bit of loss how to rate this airline because the first leg of the trip was excellent and the second leg was non-existent (our flight was canceled). The leg from Tallinn to Lisbon was very enjoyable despite the long flight time (almost 5 hours). The staff were very friendly the plane was nice and clean and the flight was smooth. The food was the best I've eaten on an aircraft so far. After spending a few days in Lisbon I got an e-mail that our return trip to Tallinn had been canceled. The next day I decided not to take risks and went directly to TAP Portugal's office in the city and got new tickets from Lisbon to Frankfurt and Frankfurt to Tallinn. The Lisbon to Frankfurt flight was operated by a Bulgarian charter airline. Frankfurt to Tallinn was Lufthansa. Both of the flights went fine. However the Frankfurt flight is a flight that is late 56% of the time! We were rather nervous whether we would catch the connecting flight to Tallinn or not. On top of that because the flight to Frankfurt left so early (14.20 instead of 22.00 which was the original departure time to Tallinn) and because I had to run to TAP Portugal's office and then to the airport to check-in and print the boarding passes we more or less lost an entire day of our vacation in Lisbon. The root of the problem is that TAP Portugal seems to have a very aggressive expansion policy they are opening new routes but the capacity in terms of airplanes and crew are simply not there to support it. That's why for example the Frankfurt flight was flown by BH Air the Bulgarian charter airline. On top of that I think the Portuguese airline lacks the discipline and in-depth planning capability to make sure everything goes smoothly and that results in ruined vacations and people missing important events. The only saving grace is that TAP Portugal is a big airline and a member of Star Alliance so even if their flights get cancelled you are likely to get home. However I would think twice before using this airline again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,,,False,
TAP Portugal customer review,,2014-07-29,Recent journey from northern Norway to Porto was delayed by a full 24 hours and transformed from a straightforward trip to an exhausting marathon. I received an email on July 19 that my flight with TAP from Oslo to Lisbon on the 21st had been cancelled (no reason given) and I should contact them about the flight. After spending almost an hour on the phone before getting assistance I was told that I had been put on a KLM flight to Amsterdam connecting with a TAP flight to Porto and sent a copy of the new routing. All went well until I arrived in Amsterdam to discover that the TAP flight to Porto had been cancelled. There was no TAP staff available at the transfer desk and I finally obtained help from the staff at the Star Alliance lounge. I was put on a TAP flight to Lisbon the next day at 11.45 am with a wait until 5.45pm for the connecting half hour flight to Porto. The flight to Porto was delayed 1.5 hours so that I missed the last bus from Porto airport to my final destination. Needless to say I am a bit apprehensive about my return flights on TAP from Porto to Lisbon and onward to Oslo this coming Monday. All in all my experience with TAP has been frustrating and irritating and I will think twice before using them again in the future.,False,,,Business Class,,,,3,,,1,,False,
TAP Portugal customer review,,2014-07-29,Recife to London via Lisbon and the next day flew London to Kolkata via Mumbai with Jet Airways. The 2nd time now the flight from Recife to Lisbon has been cancelled and changed to another time which is not so bad. But the second time on this leg that it was in fact not a TAP plane at all but a charter plane from 'Euro Atlantic' being operated by TAP. It was a terrible 1986 aircraft no operational TV's for a long haul flight seat did not go back at all and it was a night flight!

TAP Portugal customer review,,2014-07-29,Worst Flight experience I have had so far (I am a frequent flyer). I had a flight from Lisbon to Recife (Brazil). The plane was old. My seat was loose and uncomfortable. After take off I complained about it. There was no inflight video service. On an 8 hour flight drinks were only served twice. When I asked for water she rejected my request. There was no alternative meal only a sandwich with bad cheese ham and no butter and rice with dry chicken no sauce. Nothing else for eight hours.

TAP Portugal customer review,,2014-07-27,My husband and I booked a flight to see the World Cup in Rio at the beginning of June. We met some people on the flight who had problem with their flights from Portugal to Rio de Janeiro. The queue at the airport to get new flights was long. We could already see the problem the company had with delays. I have nothing to say about the service onboard the food or the entertainment. Everything was nice. The problem is the administration and the schedules they have. On our way back from Rio we got the bad news that our flight to Portugal was delayed 8 hrs. Instead of flying that night at 22.30 we were supposed to fly the day after at 6.30 am. We got just vouchers for dinner. No hotel so we spent the night at the airport. No explanation about the delay.

Received a call from TAP the day before flying that the second leg from Lisbon to Fortaleza would be operated by Windrose (a Ukrainian company working with TAP) so no time to change your flight (rebooking or cancellation as you need to get to your destination). 1st leg from Heathrow was OK. The second leg operated by Windrose departed 1 hour later than scheduled from Lisbon including a wait of 30 mins inside the bus taking us from the gate to the aircraft. The aircraft was an old A330. It had no entertainment system (No movies no music no games - nothing). What do you do on a 7hr journey like this? Although the Windrose crew were friendly and should not be blamed for anything this is a real disgrace for TAP selling a product that is below current long haul travel standards and not playing fair and transparent with the customer about the product which they are selling.

Crazy enough though I think we were the 'lucky' ones as on the outgoing leg most of the TAP flights on the Lisbon departure board were delayed by 5+ hours. What is going on?!

The flight AGP-LIS was late by 2 hours and almost lost the connecting flight LIS-FNC. AGP-LIS had the most appalling flight attendant I can't understand why TAP would pay a salary to have people like him who would be better driving a truck than hosting passengers. He just didn't care. On the flight LIS-FNC we were late by 1h and a half plus they emailed me a week before to say the flight had been rescheduled. Ended up flying more time than usual due to high winds in Madeira.

Very poor service for a Western Country based airline. Wasted our whole day. No compensation no care was granted for a frequent traveller like me and it caused huge inconvenience and cost of taking a £120 taxi back home. TAP has to step up if they wish to compete and even perhaps survive without subsidies (if any) with not only the likes of BA but also the low cost carriers like EasyJet and Ryanair.

We arrived in Lisbon without our luggage as did a half dozen other passengers. We were on a 43 day trip around the world and this was day 3. Not good. After 3 days our luggage arrived. My gripe is why did it take 3 days come to find out our luggage was never boarded in Malaga. I would guess this was due to weight restrictions as we saw them unload the baggage and there were only a few pieces. There was plenty of space left in the baggage compartment. The luggage could have been with us early the next morning. as there were several flights that could make this happen. I believe there was a neglect on the airlines side that they didn't get it to us sooner. Especially since we filed a loss luggage report at once. This would have made it a lot less stressful on us. We were about to go shopping or new clothes on day 3 of the ordeal when the 2 pieces arrived. I would fly Portugalia Airlines again but not in this type of aircraft. Employees were helpful in tracing the lost luggage but updating the online information wasn't. When it arrived it still said it was still searching for it.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,,,,,,False,

Speaking to fans at games TAP did this on Wednesday Thursday and Friday of this week! On return flight 1 July 11.25pm from Recife to Lisbon TAP swapped the plane to a charter airline Air Europa and emailed me 4 hours before departure saying I could change my flight if I desired. Having already checked out of Hotel and waiting in Recife for 6 hours what did they elect me to do. The charter plane was obviously known about days in advance so why did they not email sooner so I could have arranged alternative transport home. The staff on the plane were superb but the plane seating was a disaster tiny seat pitch and no entertainment.

TAP Portugal customer review,7,2014-07-06,Lisbon to Rome and vice-versa (June 30th and July 4th) was late on both days. On the 4th of July the plane was supposed to take off at 7.25pm (local hour) but at 9pm the plane was still taxiing to the runway. Except for this detail I enjoyed both flights. On the first flight (Lisbon-Rome) I found the breakfast surprisingly good (for an airline meal). The sandwich had a strange appearance but I wanted another one when I finished. On the second flight a light meal (not a full dinner) was served. I also found the potato puree with turkey sausages and bacon pretty tasty. The flight crew were also very nice and attentive although on the first flight they seemed a little tired. At least they were not rude and on the same flight I saw the flight attendants speaking Portuguese English Italian French and Spanish to the passengers. The seats were comfortable and the plane in general was clean. I also thought both landings were quite rough. If you are going on shorts flights with TAP please take a book or something else. If you don't you might get stuck watching the cartoon version of Mr Bean. In general if you are going on vacations and you don't mind getting late to your destination TAP is surely a good airline. If you are going on business trips don't fly with TAP: the flights can get late and the business class didn't seem much different from the economy class.

Also my seat from Brazil to Lisbon had no inflight entertainment or light to read from (broken). I would also point out a good proportion of other flights were also delayed.

Flew mid haul from LIS to BRU on a relatively new 319. Online check in was easy and allowed me to select my seats and baggage drop at the airport was quick and efficient. Flight was delayed 45minutes due to strike action but all issues were communicated early allowing me to arrive at the airport later than planned and not be affected by the delay. Economy seat was wider than most rival airlines and leg room was certainly larger than usual on 319 seats were leather with full recline only downside being immovable head rest as being 6'3 it's usually too low however legroom was comfortable which is a rarity. Drinks were served during the flight (complimentary soft drinks and alcohol) as well as a tasty sandwich snack. Staff were very polite and friendly and switched effortlessly from English to Portuguese and French. Entertainment was provided in the form of drop down TV screens mostly showing cartoons with very low sound throughout the cabin which wasn't distracting.

Really ancient A330s with basic seats and an IFE that doesn't allow you to stop/start films on request and which offered only about six films anyway. These days that's just pathetic. On the last leg (LIS-BSB) there were only nine (9) people in Business and still I couldn't get my first choice meal - attendant said ""only two trays of the chicken were boarded"" - so I had overcooked and tasteless veal instead. On more than one occasion attendants on TAP have encouraged me to write and complain - they clearly feel passengers aren't getting a good deal. On these flights in June 2014 attendants were just great - thereby just about saving the airline in my view. We use TAP because I can get to the UK in only two flights from Brasilia not three. If other airlines were to offer this I'd take it - and Air France are starting to do so. So I'll be reviewing my bookings.

You have to love when you leave the gate for a 2.5 hour flight only to have to sit on the plane an extra 2.5 hours before taking off (and then of due to the delays you miss your connection home and have to spend an extra night in a hotel and the flight home the next morning is delayed over 2 hours too). Despite the chronic delays expensive tickets old aircraft's and bad food the experience was not good TAP is an airline I will avoid at all cost in the future.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,
TAP Portugal customer review,2,2014-05-24,LGW-LIS what a shambling miserable experience! Cabin crew unfriendly none smiled once during boarding or during the flight. One hour into the flight before any cabin crew were seen and even then made to feel as if they were doing you a favour. Food cold so it was not as if they were preparing a gastronomic delight which they certainly were not. I would suggest the crew from this flight look for other jobs if they are that miserable. I doubt I would fly with TAP again. Airline let down by their crew who could do with some customer focused training!,False,,,Business Class,,,3,1,,,1,,False,
TAP Portugal customer review,9,2014-05-23,BRU-LIS-BRU. Nice flights. Mobile check-in worked fine both ways. Seating in the front part of the cabin was good and plenty of legroom.

TAP Portugal customer review,1,2014-05-21,Lisbon to Luanda Round Trip in economy class. This was my last flight with TAP Portugal on this route the tickets are expensive compared with poor service you receive in exchange. Old aircraft with refurbished interiors poor food and delays in both flights. The flight to Luanda was a nightmare I endured 8 hours listening to a screaming child was not kids fault but crew fault. I ask to change seat and it was denied without any reason or explanation I saw available seats on the back. After this episode not one cabin crew member to be seen for hours. On the way back (night flight) the food they served was inedible many meals barely touched and passengers complaining. The cabin staff was more friendly but was visible that this situation was definitely harder for them to.

TAP Portugal customer review,3,2014-05-08,TP 619 BRU-LIS Apr 30 and TP 574 LIS-FRA May 3. Technically reliable airline flying a relatively new fleet with generally friendly crews. Hopelessly incapable of flying on time though. Have flown them 8 times since December only once was the flight on time otherwise delays varied between 30 and 90 minutes. Moreover hardly ever info is given to passengers or even an apology. Executive (Business) class is quite comfortable on long-haul flights but seats in Economy are very uncomfortable and there is basically no space left when the passenger in front of you decides to recline his or her seat. Do not recommend if you value punctuality.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,False,
TAP Portugal customer review,8,2014-05-06,"Thankfully this flight was much better than the other reviews had us believe. It was a 3 hour flight to Lisbon from Frankfurt. The staff at check in and onboard were very friendly and full of life. The food and drinks were served efficiently. Very tasty too but we skipped the octopus! Our seats in row1 on the 319 plane were comfortable but we weren't looking to sleep. The incline isn't very much. We had our own movies on IPads as there was no other ""entertainment"".

TAP Portugal customer review,2,2014-04-27,I haven't flown TAP for over 10 years but have recently decided to try their business class on a flight from London to Recife in Brazil. What a disappointment! Both my flights were delayed and to find the small overcrowded business lounge at Lisbon airport was a challenge. I had to go through customs and immigration and the TAP ground staff were very unhelpful. The flight experience was very poor. The seats were old fashioned and uncomfortable and the inflight entertainment was very limited. The food was just edible but the staff service was inconsistency and disorganised. A total waste of money and I would not recommend it to anyone.,False,,,Business Class,,,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,
TAP Portugal customer review,3,2014-04-25,LIS-ZAG via BLQ business. My return flight back within one month. At this occasion more or less the same thing. Uncomfortable seats where the lumbar part is squeezing you inside. No pitch at all and the middle seat 01E next to me was occupied even if there were 2 empty seats in row 2 and 3. As it was Easter Thursday some economy pax were upgraded to C allowing us to have less space as usual. If I compare the 980 euro C class to other carriers than it is definitely not worth spending that kind of money for the same cabin as economy. The food was one course only and acceptable. Cabin crew service was incompetent unhelpful and mainly hidden in the rear galley during 5h flight. No welcome drink no entertainment no newspapers no nothing. Fortunately on this occasion I did not pay for the flight but would never buy such a product by myself. Last but not least TAP did not find my lost bag from the outbound flight nor did they took any responsibility so far almost 50 days later!,False,,,Business Class,,,1,1,,,1,,False,

TAP Portugal customer review,8,2014-03-27,EWR-OPO-BRU and AMS-LIS-EWR. Was pleasantly surprised by the practicality and quality of this airline. They fly the Newark - Porto route twice/week and the Newark - Lisbon route the remaining 5 days. I paid only $789 for the round trip multi city flight and although I couldn't pick seats until 24 hours prior to departure I got window seats both ways and a bulkhead window seat on the return from Lisbon to Newark (11j)! Food was decent/edible although they were a little stingy on wine and tea/coffee ( they only fill glasses half way and are bad on refills). The A332 from Newark to Porto was newer then the return aircraft and had touchscreen on demand entertainment with dozens of movies including new releases like 12 yrs a slave and Dallas Buyers Club. The return A332 had personal TVs as well but the movies were on channels 1-16 and started at a set time. Flew Portugalia operated Fokker 100 to Brussels from Porto which was fine. They served a lox sandwich. Food on the return Lisbon to EWR flight had descent food - fish pie (like shepherds) and a prosciutto sandwich as a snack before landing. All edible which is how I rate airline food (edible or non-edible).,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True,
TAP Portugal customer review,4,2014-03-26,MUC-LIS-MUC. My business trips this year resulted in booking of 6 flights with TAP to Lisbon. These were my very first flights with TAP. I must say they have a nice service from the check in counter to the flight itself. Check in was fair more easy if the TAP mobile App work not in my case. Flight attendants were friendly with two small incidents in two flights. The downside is the aircraft itself very old sometimes dirty and no leg room. From those who come from Lufthansa flights with a new minimal and slim cabin layout TAP offers a 70's and 80's experience who is not pleasant on this days. The food was fair and we had slight delays on all flights. I wouldn't recommend this airline you pay a prime price and receive a service that's already outdated.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,False,
TAP Portugal customer review,1,2014-03-21,LIS-FAO-LIS. Business Class. They are selling Business Class with no service and same seats as Economy. On the way to FAO I had to ask for a cup of water.

TAP Portugal customer review,5,2014-03-17,ZAG-LIS with stop in BLQ 11 March 2014. No possibility to select seat online. The business class cabin is exactly the same as economy and the pitch is very narrow. Boarding was on time and we left on time. However the short stop in Bologna was 1 hour for 48 passengers who boarded. The service was below average. Nothing served on the first leg of 50 minutes. When asked I got a drink and peanuts. The second leg was better with nice selection of food and wine well presented. However the cabin crew were mostly in the galley chit-chatting and only taking care of us when strictly necessary. No IFE at all during 5.5 hr flight! We arrived 15 minutes ahead of schedule in Lisbon but parked in an outside position. It took us more than 30 mins to disembark due to very slow ground service provided. Finally my bag was lost.,False,,,Business Class,,,2,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,False,
TAP Portugal customer review,4,2014-03-14,Flew from Lisbon to Salvador in Business Class. On the positive the first meal that was served was excellent and flight attendants (most of them) very friendly and attentive. There was a wide selection of food and good wines (incl. Port Wine). The second meal a sandwich was very average: I would not pay 2 Euros for it in a shop. But the main problem is with the seat and the entertainment system: it is all so old that one asks him/herself if it's really worth the 3500 Euros they charge for those flights? I would not fly Business with TAP again until they upgrade their seats and their entertainment system.,False,,,Business Class,,,2,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,False,
TAP Portugal customer review,9,2014-03-11,LIS-LHR on 10th March. Anyway after a seamless check-in there was a structured boarding and coached out to the aircraft.

We pre-reserved seats which were not respected even being TAP Corporate/Upgrade Program with all the benefits of Silver/Gold TAP milles card. Check in at BCN was basic not giving a decent corporate service. I was not advised about the seats and lounge options. Flight BCN-LIS departed 40m late and have plenty of free seats. Airbus aircraft was dirty and old. The cabin crew served poor food (same food as economy). Drinks OK but no chance to repeat because the crew disappeared for the entire flight. Reading light was not working staff did not do anything to help. My return flight to Barcelona was better but the 2 hr 40min delay without any info is unacceptable. TAP corporate Lounge in Lisbon is small was pack smelly and they only served cheap snacks. Boarding by bus 40m pack inside the bus and the airplane was extremely old. All in all not a good experience to captive new customers. TAP is trying hard to innovate but the competition is always two steps ahead TAP.

I am not usually one to write a review but on this occasion I felt compelled to after the appalling service I received in Business Class. On the outbound route the staff were curt unhelpful and rude the food disgusting and the seats uncomfortable. The entertainment was on a loop video system as found on aircraft in the 1980's with some of the screens defective. Upon arrival in Brazil quite a lot of the baggage mine included had been left at Lisbon and did not arrive until 3 days later. We had to go to the airport to collect it. Returning on the inbound flights no lounge was provided for TAP air Business Class customers and likewise on the transfer at Lisboa Airport no airside lounge was available so had to sit for 3 hours by the gate.

On arrival at Fortaleza we were told that the flight on the Saturday night had been cancelled and passengers from that flight were put on our flight. We were being 'bumped' to a later flight!

Flight delays on both legs not friendly flight attendants no proper food just poor snacks but the major let down was the aircraft itself - an ancient Fokker 100 with broken seat on return that when you're seated was truly unpleasant.

On return I lost my British Airways flight. Bought a TAP Portugal return flight from Lisbon. I was initially happy to use TAP ""main Portuguese carrier"" instead of low-cost carriers like Ryanair or Easyjet. TAP Portugal is a low-cost carrier with expensive tickets and lousy service. Flight was delayed 1 hr 20 mins no excuses or proper information given to passengers. Disorganised boarding with unprofessional ladies shouting no apologies from captain or crew there was no inflight entertainment newspaper magazines or wi-fi on the flight to London. Only drinks served for the entire flight. Leg room was very poor. So the return journey had all the hallmarks of a ""no frills"" budget airline. However the ticket was purchased at a premium (almost££380 for the return journey in Economy class) when Ryanair and Easyjet charge £65.

Arrived 25 mins ahead of schedule. TAP offers decent consistent service the only down point is that they always start meal/drinks service after reaching cruising altitude which in some cases is after 1-1.5 hrs after take off!

Food: very poor in quality and quantity. I discovered that they serve the same food also on the economy class. In this case chicken and rice pudding were the same.

The flight information screens are not always updated or accurate and the check-in area is always overcrowded and disorganized! To make matters worse many of the check-in and gate agents are unprofessional and rude. Last week we were kept 15min inside a hot bus before it was dispatched to the aircraft.

Only when we were on board did the announcement come that they were flying with a ""minimum crew"" and therefore there would be no on-board service. During the 2.5 hour flight they offered us a glass of water. I know this airline is in trouble financially but they could have announced the absence of service before people boarded (preferably at check-in) so that we could at least buy some food and coffee to take on board (Starbucks in the departure lounge for example).

Told to fly to Lisbon and they would resolve my issue. In Lisbon I was told I had no ticket and that my son could fly with my husband but not me. I did not move from the front of the line when they told me they could not assist me it took almost 2 hours to solve my issue.

We were told it would cost 8 euros to check the bag. My husband took out 10 euros and the rep said to bring the cash to customer service. When we got to customer service we were told it was 80 euros not 8. We had to pay it because the bag had already been taken otherwise we would've emptied some things into our carry- ons. Keep in mind we had one checked bag between us. We were technically under weight! Next we were seated in the back of the aircraft so by the time the food cart came to us they were out of one selection. The other selection was awful. Our child ate barely anything. The snack brought later on was a dried out Swiss cheese sandwich that was inedible. Most passengers left it intact and sent it back. For $950 a ticket one would think the food would at least be edible. We won't be using TAP again.

One hour delay at airport 3 hours flight and only a glass of water not even a coffee. It appears that they save the food and drinks for the return flight from Frankfurt to Lisbon.

Its the third time this month TAP have cancelled and changed my flights without a warning. But the worst was to come TAP lost is sense of good service they are turning into a cheap low-cost”airline. TAP got me on an afternoon flight to Lisbon. Suddenly they announced we have to land in Hamburg and then we would leave for Lisbon! We all couldn't believe it now had to go back to Hamburg and then go to Lisbon. The plane to Lisbon wasn't full and when we landed in Hamburg people actually got off and new passengers got on it. So seems like we had to do the whole detour just to pick up more passengers. TAP is just a bus with wings. From Hamburg to Lisbon no food.

Had planned to fly back on Sept 20th flight from Horta to LIS was cancelled in April and would we change to fly from Ponta Delgada (350 km distance). We booked on the flight for the 21st and had to book (and pay of course) one night plus in our hotel. For the flight home we luckily did online check-in the day before where we learned that we were not booked on the flight. Phone call revealed that the flight we had originally booked had been re-established and carried out though and that they had booked us back on that plane without telling us so that we had unwillingly produced no- show some hours ago. Luckily there were still free seats on the plane for next morning so they booked us back and 5 minutes later we could proceed to our online check-in. Flights as such were okay food was rather good crew quite kind but I had to go myself to the rear and ask for water because nobody responded to the attendant's call.

TAP Portugal customer review,,2013-09-24,I am flying frequently with TAP between Vienna and Lisbon. The flights themselves are usually unspectacular however the course on Sunday evening from VIE to LIS has a delay rate of 100% (everytime approximately an hour). In general flying TAP from Lisbon to anywhere with TAP has become a nightmare over the summer period: Chaotic check-in in LIS with huge crowds as TAP seems to be unable to deal with the amount of passengers they have during the summer season. Latest event: My wife flew today LIS-GVA-VIE. She was informed at check-in that the flight would be delayed 35min but that there would be no meal served to insufficient crew. She was not given a voucher or anything like that. In the end they were unable to find any crew at all the plane finally took off with more than 2 hours delay. Since at some point it got tight with the connecting flight she tried to get a place on a different flight (there was a direct one to Vienna more or less at the same time) at the transfer desk in Lisbon. Staff there were very unhelpful just telling her that they could do nothing and that she had to ask the ground staff in GVA for help not respecting repetitive information by wife that the flight she had to catch in GVA was the last one of the day to VIE. She only made that connecting flight thanks to the kind help of the ground staff of SWISS in GVA who picked her up at the plane from LIS and guided her directly to the gate for VIE. In a nutshell TAP Air Portugal should be renamed into Take Another Plane (at least if you have an alternative). I only use it since it is the only airline offering direct flights between VIE and LIS.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,1,,False,
TAP Portugal customer review,10,2013-09-24,My wife and I flew LGW-LIS on 14/8/13 and returned LIS-LHR on 12/9/13. We have a house in Portugal and fly this route twice a year usually with TAP. As with all the other TAP flights we have taken in the past 5 years or so departure and was on time on both legs. The aircraft's were clean the cabin crew smart and reasonably friendly. The service provided was good. We know not to expect 4 star cuisine on European short-haul flights and the snack provided is quite acceptable. The seats and legroom are perfectly adequate. Lisbon Airport is now a joy to travel through with the recent improvements made. Contrast this with the shabby and overcrowded T1 at LHR!! The only downside is for some unknown reason the LGW-LIS flight is always parked at a remote corner of Lisbon airport necessitating a somewhat lengthy transfer by bus to the Terminal. I would always choose this airline in preference to Easyjet since once you factor in all the Easyjet 'options' there is usually not much difference in the price of the ticket.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True,

TAP Portugal customer review,1,2013-09-17,I travelled from London to Lisbon on Friday 12 September 2013 the flight was more than an hour delayed there was no food on the plane we were given vouchers to get food from Heathrow food shops. There were no space between the seats even though I was sitting at the aisle. If I wanted such service I would have booked a ticket with a low budget airline and not with TAP. On the return flight the flight was delayed only 45 min we were given food but they were short of staff so when one of the cabin crew from the business class willed to help his colleagues in economy he was told off by his other colleague and probably superior from the business class.

TAP Portugal customer review,,2013-09-15,"Disgraceful business class flight flight 346 from FNC to LGW on 14th September. No food or drink served for entire flight other than one small glass of water as they were operating to ""minimum safety"" standards. No warning prior to boarding so no chance to even get a sandwich and a bottle of water from the airport departure lounge. I understand that emergency staff shortages can and do arise however this has happened on several occasions recently and seems to be something more than just a shortage of one member of cabin crew. Flight arrived from Lisbon short crewed so the airline had several hours before the Gatwick flight departed to either arrange for another member of crew to join our flight or to make provision for passengers to be given a voucher for food/drink before departure or at the very least to make passengers aware of the situation on check-in so they could make their own arrangements to take food/water on board. The lack of communication was disgraceful. The entire episode was very poorly handled and not what one would expect from a national carrier airline. It's really not good enough when you pay a premium to not have to travel with a ""no frills"" airline and get less than basic service. Passengers have a choice of airlines on the Funchal - Gatwick route and TAP would be well advised to re- think some of their policies if they do not want to lose their market share of this route.",False,,,Business Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,False,

This is the second time this has happened to me on TAP. In June I flew from Zurich to Lisbon and was also told there was no service on board. I don't suppose TAP has ever heard of the word replacements so when one of the crew cannot make it then someone replaces them. TAP is the best advertisement for other airline companies. I shall do everything I can NEVER to fly TAP again. I am a frequent flier but can also get miles when I fly Lufthansa. I travel to Amsterdam every other month so I shall fly KLM.

TAP Portugal customer review,,2013-09-10,Flew from Zurich to Lisbon and then from Lisbon to Paris on a different trip. Zurich to Lisbon was the most uncomfortable flight I've been on (until the one from Lisbon to Paris). The seats are minuscule and legroom is non-existent. I'm 6'3 and my knees were unable to fit behind the seats large metal plates and brackets from the seat in-front of me on both flights were cutting into my legs. My legs literally had to be set all to one side and somewhat on top of the armrests in order to not have metal gouging my knees. My Wife is 5'4 and also had problems sitting in the seats without her knees hitting the metal plates on the seat in front of her. The 1st flight was only delayed 20 minutes. The flight from Lisbon to Paris we waited at the airport for 14 hours from the time we got there with minimal or no updates. Of-course when we got to Paris all of our bags were lost.

Most of the time there won't be any meal due to their constant policy of flying with minimum crew. Can't understand why this happens but it seems to be a general policy of the company now.

I thought there must have been an equipment substitution but the crew informed me this was indeed Business class. Truly a 3rd world set up and I will avoid TAP at all costs in the future.

TAP Portugal customer review,,2013-08-29,LIG-LGW and LGW-LIS. 23rd August and 27th August respectively. As mentioned in many other reviews here there was an extremely long check-in queue with only two check-in desks open. The flight was over an hour delayed in departing. This was followed by a very long delay in luggage retrieval at Gatwick which to be fair might be more the disorganisation of Groundforce. Return flight on the 27th was appalling. I was probably one of the first people to check-in so did not know there was no inflight service available until we had been in the air for almost an hour. I had to virtually beg for a cup of water. What I would like to know is how TAP thinks it can hold on to its share of the market in this way. The Star Alliance has given them a huge advantage by using the names of other well-reputed airlines to sell tickets but I warn other to ensure that their Lufthansa flight is not run by Tap Portugal because the flight I took on that occasion was the worst flying experience I had ever had. This last experience has simply ensured that I will do my utmost to avoid flying with Tap again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,

On this flight no information was provided first info comes at 21.00 the flight should leave at 21.30 then a second one putting the departure date at 22.00. The flight leaves at 22.40 arriving in Barcelona the next day. I leave the airport at 02.00 (expensive Taxi fare home). Onboard the staff were OK but keeping the low standard service.

What followed was further disarray as the other staff simply shrugged. Left to simply go to the very back of the remaining queue. On the return journey there was a similar case with half a dozen different flights merged into two queues which then resulted in 'emergency desks' being opened. Check-in took 2 hours on this occasion. Boarded on 07/08/2013 from Manchester to Lisbon. Departure time of 11.20am passed and we were delayed. No communication as to why.

Inflight entertainment is a choice of 13 channels that play in loops (something I haven't seen on a flight for over 10 years). The only good thing is a bit of leg-space (better than some Air France Boeings) flying to Brazil. The ground personnel are not much better.

I fly fortnightly on Business and regularly for pleasure and this was the first time we had used TAP. I was happily surprised by the service and quality of flight we received. As a regular traveller to Madeira from the UK it has become rather expensive to use so called low cost carriers and charters to the island so we turned to TAP in the hope they would be able to service our requirements and they far exceeded my expectations. Yes I agree their service could be improved by more presence in the cabin but the cabin crew were friendly and efficient. The leg room and seat space for a large build 6ft3 chap was brilliant for an economy seat. We boarded on time however 25 minutes late leaving LGW due to heavy traffic.

TAP Portugal customer review,,2013-07-30,My flight yesterday was from Brussels to Marrakech - connecting in Lisbon. Initial flight out was delayed causing us to miss our connecting flight to Marrakech which was the last flight and only flight into Marrakech out of Lisbon airport. The whole situation was preventable had the airport staff skipped us to the front of the customs line or even moved us to the European passport line. We waited in the US passport line for 30 minutes - while there was no wait in the European passport line. When I explained to staff that I was going to miss my flight he responded that the TAP Portugal flight had been delayed 30 minutes so I would still make my flight. When I got to the gate the plane was there but the gate was closed. In fact the flight was not delayed 30 minutes rather they waited an extra 10 minutes for late passengers but apparently not for us. The TAP customer service rep was rude and incompetent. She gave us bad instructions on retrieving our luggage and it took us almost 3 hours to get our suitcases. We arrived at Lisbon airport at 2.15 - by the time we dealt with all the unfortunate nonsense it was almost 6pm before we got in a cab.

TAP Portugal customer review,2,2013-07-30,"AMS-OPO (TP651 on 25/7/2013) and OPO-AMS (TP652 on 29/7/2013). Inbound flight delayed 1hr 35mins for a 2hr 38mins flight. Outbound flight delayed 30 minutes. Delays are constant on this route. The last 10 flights I flew on this route were all delayed. The explanation was always the same: ""late arrival of the aircraft"" which really is no explanation whatsoever as to say that the flight is late because the aircraft is late amounts to say nothing at all. The delays led to the loss of takeoff/landing slots and/or to the allocation of the farthest takeoff/landing runaway in Schiphol which adds to the delays and is frustrating to the passengers. Priority luggage at the arrival of the aircraft in Amsterdam was delivered last compounding the delay. Boarding was chaotic with everyone boarding simultaneously and queues not being respected both in OPO and AMS. Aircraft on this route (Fokker-100) are old and outdated. TAP Portugal is expensive (flight costs are those of a premium airline while the service is certainly not) inefficient and its on-time performance is appalling. Although the food is decent in the business cabin the service is nothing special with attitude shown from both the cabin crew and the handling staff. It is dangerously placed in an airline limbo: its service is slightly better than a low cost - food/drinks and newspapers are provided - but its cost is that of a premium airline. However delays are a constant. All in all it would not be a sustainable airline if it did not have the advantage of the de-facto monopoly in certain routes.

TAP Portugal customer review,,2013-07-19,FNC-LIS-FNC. There is a recurring issue when flying with this airline which is the cabin crew. More than usual they are flying with ‘minimum cabin crew’ which actually means you won't get served any meal whatsoever. Not even a cup of water don't mind asking. Cabin crew more than surly seems absent minded and just don't care about passengers. I'm a frequent flyer and I always get the feeling I'm a burden to them. Low cost carriers offer much better product. Unfortunately for some routes they got the exclusive monopoly.

I managed to get transferred onto the morning flight at 09.45. Changed gate almost 5 times before passengers commenced boarding. In the process of boarding flight was cancelled.

Provided with adequate accommodation and dinner and breakfast. Taken back to airport at 12.00 noon when were rechecked onto the supposedly repaired aircraft and a connection from Lisbon to Manchester. Scheduled take off 15.00. At 14.25 asked the lounge staff to confirm if we needed to go to the gate as the Departures board had not changed. They had no information and could not get a reply by telephone from TAP so we were advised to go straight to the Gate. No TAP staff there and very few passengers. Went back with other passengers to the Check-in Desks which were simply chaotic. Offered seats on an alternative flight by BA but warned by other passengers that BA were not honouring TAPs tickets. This was because of the difference in value and even after wasting an hour walking round the airport with a TAP staff member the best we could get was an economy ticket in exchange for our TAP Club equivalent.

Once on board nowhere to store luggage due to all overhead lockers been laden with oversized bags. Tried to use half empty overhead locker used for staff but was refused. Hand luggage placed on lap. No explanation for late running of aircraft. Piece of luck on arriving at Lisbon Faro flight delayed by 45 minutes so did not miss Faro connection. Food onboard is a joke especially when my ticket was 333 euros. Also note that passengers who use TAP seem to check-in 30 kilo plus bags so expect a long wait at check-in.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,2,,False,
