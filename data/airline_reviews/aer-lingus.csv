I called to request a bassinet seat for my baby to be able to sleep on the 7 hour flight from Chicago to Dublin (8 hours on the way back), and I was told to contact Special Assistance through their website, which I did. I was then told via email that I was assigned row 30 on flight EI122, and was told this was a bassinet row.

The flight attendants told me not much could be done, but finally we begged to switch with someone in row 9 and someone was kind enough to do it. However, I had to move back before landing so that the original passenger in row 9 could alight the plane first, so had to lug myself, my infant son, and all our stuff back and forth three separate times.  While onboard my flight to Chicago, I discovered eventually that my seat's media system was broken, the remote for it did not work, so that even though the screen seemed to be fine, I could not control anything/make anything play on it. This meant I could not watch anything, could not listen to anything, could not even call the flight attendant, turn on my own light.

I can't imagine I am the only one (I'm probably one of hundreds if not thousands) who is having to reschedule their flight because they will not be let into the country due to unexpected test results. But Aer Lingus offer no sort of flight credit or flexibility, even though I have no way of knowing when I will test negative and be let back into the US. It could be in two days time, it could be in twenty days time, and Aer Lingus only seeks to make you change your flight over and over again, charging you more and more money each time, even though this is something completely out of the passenger's control.

I checked the COVID test requirements for Canada (my final destination) in the days leading to my flight and read that I needed to have a negative PCR done within 72 hours of flying. This I did 2 days pre-flight. When I arrived at the airport at 8:00AM, the Aer Lingus check in staff queried my COVID certificate, but I told her that my final destination was Canada, not US, and I was told that my COVID certificate was then ""fine"". My baggage was checked in, I got through security, US customs and border protection, and all the way I proceeded to the boarding gate. When I approached the boarding gate staff at 10:40AM, I was asked to fill out a form for US clearance stating that I had a negative test within the last 24 hours. I couldn’t sign this and told the ground attendant that my final destination was Canada. He told me to wait aside. After all the other passengers have been boarded, he told me that I could not board the flight to New York since I didn’t have a negative test taken within the previous 24 hours. At that stage, it was then too late for me to get an antigen test. The other ground attendant told me the luggage would be off-loaded and I will have to collect them in carousel 6. He tried to rebook my flight, but since I had booked with Trip.com, he said I should contact the travel agency as he couldn’t change it. I was escorted to the exit leading to baggage reclaim and told “You know if you hadn’t said anything, we would have never noticed it. That’s what you get for being so honest.” I contacted Trip.com and the rep said she will forward an urgent flight change request to Aer Lingus. I then got an email stating “the airline said that according to the policy they cannot operate the change. Your ticket is non-changeable after departure, it is all up to the airline company.” At that stage, my options being extremely limited, I rebooked my flights to Calgary at a cost of 644 euro plus I had to get another PCR test for 69 euro. I managed to fly next day but to add insult to injury, all the luggage that I paid for went missing and did not arrive with me.  If I had been told at check-in on my original flight that my COVID cert was invalid for the US, and if my luggage had not been checked through, I would have had time to get a negative antigen test, I wouldn’t have been denied boarding and wouldn’t have incurred the extra expense (644 euro flight + 69 euro PCT test).  I have written to Aer Lingus and they initially ""offered"" to refund the flight. However, that also seemed to be the end of the conversation from them. I submitted multiple follow-up requests using their case update portal but haven't received a single response since then. Trip.com will refund me but they cannot proceed as Aer Lingus has not refunded them yet. What happened to me was an avoidable mistake by the ground attendants at the airport.

Because I had bid on an upgrade that had not yet been processed I wanted to make sure to cancel before that bid processed. after many hours over several days trying to get through to their reservations department I was charged the upgrade fee. To cancel my flight I resorted to an email. I have spent the last several months trying to get the upgrade fee returned to no avail. I would not recommend this airline.

"""would have preferred a refund""",2,2020-05-06,"I booked my flights through Aer Lingus and put in the bids for upgrades. The first flight out was on 12th  march and the upgrade bid was accepted and paid for. Unfortunately within a few days of travel the holiday was cancelled and we were advised to return home. Aer Lingus offered free change of flight but price difference would apply. The change function on the website and app were not working. I received a message telling me to contact direct by phone. I was surprised by this in such an age of automation, and a little disappointed. But I was given no other option by Aer Lingus. I called as advised and was on hold for a full 2 hours, I then spoke to an agent who advised my change of flights would be €435 as this represented the fare difference. I accepted and was asked to wait so he could set up payment, then he hung up without taking payment. I was not called or contacted by this agent despite him confirming my phone and email details. So I called again, and again on hold, this went on for 90 minutes when again, having not spoken to an agent, the line was hung up. I called again and after 1 hour the same occurred. That now made it close to 5 hours and no change of flights possible, the frustration at this lack of basic functionality in such a company I found staggering. With the global situation going from bad to worse and the fear of being trapped in the states with no medical insurance and all the other problems a lock down or illness would bring, we had no choice but to book completely different flights to get us home. Again we went with Aer Lingus and this cost us €1577.76. Although I was glad I could get us home, and in the knowledge that I did not have to use Aer Lingus again, despite being so frustrated at the lack of service, I did. But would have been a lot happier if the same ease to book new flights could have been matched by the process for changing existing flights. I received a mail 18th of March to say that I could cancel my flights for the 23rd and would receive a credit in the way of a flight credit plus 10%, again I would have preferred a refund but, was happy to cancel the flight and take the credit to be used later. Then I received a mail to say that my upgrade for my cancelled flight home had been approved and a further €980 had been debited to my card. I now make that a total of €2,5557.76 that I have paid Aer Lingus for flights I should have been able to change for €435. A staggering €2,122.76 cost difference because Aer lingus could not provide basic functionality to change a flight during an emergency. since then I have sent a number of emails looking for clarification and have been replied to by different people each time. the latest tells me that no vouchers apply for flights before the 21st of March. my flight was on the 23rd and I have provided all the documentation they have asked for on this.  In my latest call to them, after a further long wait, I was told that this would have to be dealt with by a manager and I was promised a call within 48 hours, this has not happened.

"""disorganization in Frankfurt""",1,2020-01-25,"I was flying from Frankfurt to Boston via Dublin. At the counter in Frankfurt I and about 20 other passengers were told by Aer Lingus staff that they would not check us in because Aer Lingus flights that day from Dublin into the US were cancelled. They did not give an explanation as to why although later I was told that it was 'operational problems'. We were sent to a separate desk with generic airport booking employees unrelated to Aer Lingus for rebooking. These airport people had to call the regular Aer Lingus hotlines in order to be able to rebook anyone, but these hotlines were busy for more than an hour, and the Aer Lingus people in those call center were only allowed to process 3 rebookings in a single call, drawing this whole process out unnecessarily. During this time the flight to Dublin had departed and the original Aer Lingus front desk people had disappeared. It took 3 hours until my rebooking was looked into, at which time most alternative transatlantic flight options for that day were gone. So were all the options with any of their partner airlines with which they allow free rebookings (of which there are few in the first place). So I was told to take a hotel and wait for a flight the next day.  I instead had to book a flight for the same day via British Airways via London on my own and had to pay over 2000EUR for that. Most of that money I now have as a loss, but at least according to EU regulation Aer Lingus owes me a compensation of 600EUR which would at least pay for a part of it. In phone calls and mail communication they have now started to claim that the flight had not been cancelled it had only been delayed and they don't owe me compensation. I checked the flight history on Flightaware and saw that EI0139 on 1/7 did indeed fly. The reason for this mess up I can't fathom. In any way, since they barred me from the flight, they owe me 600EUR regardless if the flight in the end would have been possible or not. While I'll eventually get the 600EUR, the time and money wasted so far both with the situation during the trip and dealing with them in the aftermath is enormous.

Due to the fact that my luggage was delayed I had to buy new clothing and all the necessary items needed that were in my luggage. This was a big inconvenience for me since the meeting I attended was 4 days long. I had to buy 6 extra outfits on top of toiletries. The luggage arrived at the airport 2 days later. At that time I was already in Gainesville, GA. The delivery company had called me while I was in the meeting. I got out of the meeting and I spent 20 minutes on the phone trying to find one of the host's neighbors to receive the luggage at 10PM. This, as well, was a big inconvenience. I asked for a different timing for the next day, but I was denied. When I called the claims department to make a complaint about this incident I was told I should have called earlier. I came from Spain to Chicago for a meeting that took place in GA. My schedule was very tight. I called the claims department as soon as I was available to call. At this point I am very disappointed how everything was handled. A luggage has to be with the passenger at all times. I understand that the luggage arrived 2 days later, but it was too late for me. I was out of town already without clothes and other necessities. The meeting was the highlight of my trip. The host's neighbor wakes up early. They can't be staying up to receive my luggage because the delivery company didn't want to accommodate the delivery for the next day. The neighbor wasn’t obligated to do this for me and if he hadn’t done it, the luggage could have been waited outside for a while.

I wasn’t speaking English, so nobody stopped by to ask me if I was hungry or not. Nobody from the personnel was speaking Spanish. How shameful!

After standing there for some time with no information, someone from Aer Lingus appeared and said we were being put on a bus to the Manchester airport. It took some time to get everyone loaded onto the bus then the same Aer Lingus person came to the front of the bus and made an announcement. The Aer Lingus person told us an airplane was waiting at the Manchester airport to take us to Dublin and said an Aer Lingus person would meet us at the bus upon arrival in Manchester and escort us. She also asked us to each call Aer Lingus at +353 1 761 7844 to get re-booked on the Dublin to Boston part of the trip. She added that if we couldn’t fly on to Dublin on Sunday that we would be put up in a hotel. It took about 80 minutes for an Aer Lingus representative to answer. A man finally came on the line and said he had no idea what I was talking about and he said he was sitting in New York and wasn’t sure how he could help. He did confirm that there was no way an airplane was waiting for us in Manchester and he finally booked us on a Dublin to Boston flight for Monday. We arrived in Manchester after a long bus ride to a complete customer service disaster. There was no one there to meet us as we got off the bus to escort us as promised. We weren’t sure what to do so we made our way to the Aer Lingus desk where they didn’t have a clue what was going on. They told us to use our original Aer Lingus boarding passes to get through security; obviously, after trying several times we realized that was impossible. We had to go back to the Aer Lingus desk and after another long wait, we were finally booked from Manchester to Dublin. When we arrived in Dublin, there was no one there to help us as promised. After a number of inquiries, we were told there’s an Aer Lingus customer service desk in the baggage claim area. We made our way to the Aer Lingus desk and again no one knew what we were talking about and no one had a clue how to help us, even though we were told this had all been sorted out. An Aer Lingus man didn’t know what to do so he called the Carlton Hotel and over the phone arranged for us to spend the night there. We took the shuttle and arrived at the hotel for the night.

"""calculated indifference""",1,2019-12-01,"Seattle to Birmingham via Dublin . I booked a three-segment flight to Birmingham, UK, following the route SLC to SEA, SEA to DUB, DUB to BHX. The first segment was an Alaskan Airlines codeshare. I go to the Alaska Airlines counter at Salt Lake and check-in, as I could not check-in online due to the international segments. They check my luggage through to Birmingham, and tell me to print off my Aer Lingus boarding passes in Seattle. No big deal, I think. That's not an uncommon issue with codeshares. I land at Seattle, 6 hours in advance of my next flight's departure. I exit security and make my way to the Aer Lingus ticket counter. Which, as it turns out, isn't staffed. No problem! I think (foolishly). I'll just check in at a kiosk. Oddly enough, kiosk returns ""Flight is not open for check-in."" Okay, fine I go to check-in online. But my record locator isn't working, so I call customer service. I inform them I can't print my boarding passes. They give me a record locator and tell me to try checking in online. I try, and the ""Reprint boarding passes"" button is greyed out. Let's try the mobile app - nope, ""No issuing boarding passes"" error is returned. I call customer service again. Unapologetically, they tell me to just wait until they start staffing their single ticket counter at Seattle. They also tell me to try calling my travel agency (AmEx Global Travel, in this case, who I'd booked through). I call AmEx. They apologetically explain that they don't even have an agency dial-in to Aer Lingus; they can call Aer Lingus but will get the same runaround as I did. The AmEx agents are always good people. Fine. I decide to chat with an Alaskan rep, who is friendly and tells me ""Yeah, Aer Lingus has a tendency to annoy a lot of travelers with their customer service approach."" This is 2019. ""Printing boarding passes"" is sort of a fundamental thing. The second rep I talked to on the phone told me ""We're going paperless,"" which would be great if literally any of their IT toolkits worked properly. The agents didn't know when the kiosks would be available for check-in. Nor could agents release the flight for me to check in again, or authorize re-fetching my boarding passes, or email them to me, or send them via SMS, or authorize their access with their mobile app. If you look at Google Reviews, you'll see that Aer Lingus has a well-deserved 1.2 stars out of 5 at SEATAC. I won't fly Aer Lingus again. Basic customer service can't and shouldn't really be ignored - due to them, I spent 3 hours sitting outside the security zone at SEATAC because none of their agents were either trained or had permission to actually distribute boarding passes. This is senseless, and moreover *easily corrected.* This is not complex work, and not something any other transatlantic carrier operating in North America has issues with. 0/10. Failures happen.

He looked at me and said he cannot as he closed the flight five minutes ago. I said do you would rather have it go with a few empty seats? He said I can’t do anything I closed it already. It really baffles me why an airline would not do everything it can to go full and to have had an extra seat for these missing passengers who would likely need it.

First, my initial flight from Seattle was cancelled hours before departure. I accidentally checked my email before heading to the airport and found the notification. I called their customer support and was kept on hold for 90 mins, the customer service agent was rude and offered a reroute that arrives 2 days after my initial arrival date, which meant I will miss the main purpose of the trip and attend the wedding I am supposed to. When I asked him for an earlier option, he placed me on hold again and phone was disconnected after a min. I called again and waiting around 60 mins on hold again before I was automatically disconnected again. I called for a third time and finally got to an agent after almost 80 mins. She gave me another ticket that exchanged my 12 hour flight for a 24 hour flight with 10 hour wait in Boston. I accepted the offer since I had no other choice. Second: I did fly to Boston through a JetBlue flight and the agent did check me in and routed my luggage directly to Faro airport. I arrived in Boston and waited the 10 hours during which I checked in again with an aer lingus agent who checked my passport and gave me a boarding pass and explicitly marked ""Visa OK"" on it after asking me a number of time where my final destination is. At the gate, the agent asked all passengers to check in at the desk to confirm luggage. I did and he checked my passport and issued me a new boarding pass . An hour later, I was not allowed to board to the plane by the aer lingus agent as I don't have a transit visa to Dublin. I spent the next hours running from Jetblue agents to Aer lingus agents who exchanged blame in a rude and humiliating manner. Even calling Aer lingus support line didn't help. Eventually they offered to return me back to Seattle using my $1360 ticket. As a result, I missed my vacation and didn't attend my best friend's wedding, I lost the $1360 ticket and $2000 of hotel reservations, car rentals and other arrangements After almost one week, Aer lingus did not reply to my claim for refund or compensation, although the regulations mentioned on their website explicitly mention my right for compensation in case of one side cancellation.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Faro via Dublin,August 2019,,,,1,1,,False,

I booked with a travel agency and because of this Aer Lingus would not let me access their site to reserve a seat of my choice. Due to a medical issue I like an aisle seat. Eventually the Aer Lingus call centre let me pay for a seat. I was able to check-in online a few days before departure. The bag drop in Dublin was efficient and worked well. At present, Dublin is undergoing expansion and building work. I found myself placed on a transfer bus from one building to another and then entered what looked like an annex at the far end of the airport to stand number 35. So because of this passengers for this flight formed two sets of queues consecutively. One then had to walk towards the aircraft and passengers were left waiting in an exposed area for almost 15 mins. I did not see any assistance for elderly people, the frail or disabled people. The cabin crew were friendly, they made sure they presented the safety routine with a sense of purpose. The interior of the cabin was spotlessly clean. During this flight drinks and snacks were available for purchase. It was nice to see a native Italian speaker on the crew as most of the passengers were Italian people. The flight was just over 2 hours. During this time the captain only spoke twice and on both occasions he spoke so rapidly nobody could understand a word he said! There was no route map and the inflight magazine was ripped and tattered. The lavatory was clean. I noted that 2 of the cabin crew sat at the back of the flight for the duration of the journey and did little and allowed their colleagues to do all of the work. Disembarkation was quick and efficient. This direct flight is very convenient. There is a cheaper alternative with another airline. However. Aer Lingus has a more convenient departure time and by buying well in advance the price was reasonable for high season travel. Overall a rather reasonable experience. My concern though was the experience in Dublin airport and the lack of visible help for mobility impaired passengers. With all the building work going on better signage is needed too. A nice touch quite a few passengers commented on was the use of the Irish language. This is important in promoting Irish culture and heritage by the Irish national carrier. The aircraft used was an A320 and it was in the lovely dark green Aer Lingus colours rather than the new cut-back livery.

"""now our flight is delayed""",2,2019-07-07,"Not Verified |  Chicago to Amsterdam via Dublin. This review is a long time coming. I’d like to start off on a positive note. Betty and her colleagues working at the check-in desk at O’Hare on the evening of June 27, 2019 were life savers. These women went above and beyond to help me get on an earlier transfer flight, and deserve to be acknowledged. Unfortunately, all other circumstances surrounding my trip were nightmare-ish.  I chose to fly them again due to the cost and convenience from Chicago. During my last trip with Aer Lingus my luggage was lost during a connection from Dublin to Rome. Hours and hours were spent on the phone with essentially no help. The only reason I recovered my bag was pure luck. I went to the airport to see if miraculously my bag made it on the same flight the next day and it did. Albeit, it was sitting in the middle of the airport and no one ever contacted me that it had arrived! I received zero compensation for this inconvenience despite submitting a claim to the airline.  I booked with Aer Lingus again after the last disaster because the price was significantly less, and the in-flight experience is not terrible compared to some airlines. First, plans changed prior to my departure and the customer service line was worthless. Prepare to be on hold for an hour and then speak with an operator that is prepared to do nothing to assist you. If you must fly this airline and run into an issue with your departure, the only option is to work with personnel at the origin airport directly. Additionally, the check in process at every airport (aside from O’Hare) has been run with zero efficiency. At my recent check in departing from Amsterdam back to the USA, there were two employees working the desk. A family was dealing with an issue and it held up the line for an hour. It would have made much more sense to have them step aside and work with them after the majority of passengers had checked in. The line system itself is also ridiculous. There were two lines marked “check in” and “bag drop” but since most flyers were unable to check in online (another annoyance), it was unclear if there was any differentiation in the line. This created much discord between the passengers waiting and arguments as to whose turn was next. Although I arrived at the airport with almost three hours to spare, given the check-in snafu, I felt I had to rush through security and customs. As such, I did not check my boarding pass and only realized while arriving at security that the agent did not print out a boarding pass for my transfer flight. I rushed to the gate to inquire whether they could print a pass there because of the error at check-in. They told me that they could not assist me and my only option was to re-check in at the Dublin airport. I have an hour and 35 minute layover and also have to go through US customs, so how will this be feasible? Further, now our flight is delayed and there is a very solid chance I will miss my connection back to a Chicago. All in all, do your best to avoid flying this airline at all costs.

Why can’t people tell the truth? Seemingly no slot was available and so I find myself sitting unnecessarily at the airport unable to even check in!

Our flight from Dublin, Ireland to New York (JFK) on May 5th was supposed to take off at 4:20 PM (16:20), however it did not take off until approximately 10:00 PM (22:00). We landed in New York, NY at 11:05 PM (EST.) We were supposed to arrive in New York, NY at 6:55 PM (EST.) When we arrived at the gate in Dublin there were no employees available to speak to. After some time, they announced the flight would be 15 m delayed. Approximately every 1-1.5 hours they continued to push back the time the flight would leave without any explanation. Finally, they announced it was delayed because of technical difficulties. We were also told that we would not be told if we would make it to Tampa that night until we landed in New York, NY.  When we exited the plane, we were given a printed ticket with a time for 9:54 AM the next morning  to arrive in Tampa, FL at 1:00 PM pm May, 6th 2019.

The next morning, we arrived 3 hours early at the jetblue gate (on the email it instructed to check in at jetblue and we could not check in online.) While at the Jetblue checkin, the jetblue employee told us that Aer Lingus had not finished completing our booking, and that there was nothing they could do about it.

"""all the crew members were very unfriendly""",1,2019-05-05,"Conclusion: avoid Aer Lingus if you are traveling as a family. They do not respect the value of family and no one is willing to take any responsibility after our horrible experience with them. What happened: We booked a returned flight from/to Toronto to Frankfurt. We were traveling with our 9 month old baby. Right after we booked and paid the tickets, we called the agent to request a baby bassinet and priority seats both ways immediately. We flew from Toronto to Frankfurt with bassinet, no problem. But the agent said we need to make another call before our return flight to reserve the bassinet. 48 hours before our return flight on April 1st, we called the Aer Lingus office in Germany where we would board the flight. They told us they have no access to the seating system and asked us to go to the airport counter for requesting the bassinet. We arrived three and a half hours before the scheduled flight time to check in and to request the bassinet (We were the second in line after the counter was opened). The person on the counter told us, she has no access to the flight from Dublin to Toronto, which is the long flight after our first short flight from Frankfurt to Dublin. She asked us to request the bassinet seat when we transferred at Dublin airport. I asked her, there will only be less than 2 hours transfer time, wouldn't the seats all be taken? What if we do not get a bassinet seat? She said she cannot help and we can only go and find out there. We arrived at Dublin airport, when we went to check in for the second flight, which is going to be 7 and half hours long from Dublin to Toronto. The lady at the counter said there is no bassinet seats anymore and she cannot help us. She told us rudely that there is nothing she can do and we can only go board the plane and ask the cabin crew for the seat change. We boarded the plane EI129, and of course it is full and there was no single crew member who was willing or able to help us at all. We were sitting in the middle seats. Carrying a 9 month old baby at hand. No extra seats or spaces were beside us. And all the crew members were very unfriendly to us. One of them told us it was because there was a last minute cabin change so two families with babies could not get the bassinet seats including us. They even told us: sorry this happened every week I saw many families always left without their requested prioirity seats in the end especially for Sunday and Monday flight. During the whole 7 and a half flight, we did not feel well at all. No one helped us, no one cared about us. Even when my husband was standing beside the hallway to rock the baby and tried to let her sleep because our seats were so tight and small she couldn't nap, one of the crew member came to us and said we cannot stand there. (The seat belt sign was not on at the moment). The baby was crying nonstop because she was so tired but kept getting disturbed by these actions. We asked to speak to the cabin manager three times, and throughout the whole flight not once he came to communicate with us. We felt deeply sad about the unfortunate experience.

I had to use the Aer Lingus website and then pay extra online for my luggage and preferred seat. I was not at all impressed with this side of things. I am a frequent flyer with 2 major airlines both of whom are supposedly partners of Aer Lingus. Whenever I have used EI on this route I do not receive my frequent flyer points and this is a major cause for me to not use them in the future. I was able to check-in online in advance of the flight. Bag drop was efficient but there were no uniformed staff around to help at all. There were elderly people and a non-English speaking family struggling to use the automated bag drop. I assisted 2 elderly people. This is not good enough. Boarding was not well organised at all and no announcement was made with regards to making a queue and / or the boarding order. Passengers were allowed far too much hand luggage and there was no consistency in how this was managed alas. The cabin crew failed to assist an older lady with her bag with regards to accessing an overhead locker. Announcements from the captain were robotic and the crew seemed to be rather tired and disinterested. I had one empty seat next to me and an otherwise very full flight and the window seat was occupied by a passenger clearly under the influence of alcohol. To my astonishment the cabin crew sold this person more alcohol during the flight! Landing was efficient and disembarkation slow and chaotic as luggage had been dispersed all over the plane by passengers with too much luggage. I am not at all pleased with Aer Lingus on this occasion and think they should be far more diligent and responsible than was the case on this occasion. I shall add that the hidden prices and inability of this airline to process my frequent flyer programme have put me off booking my next trip with them.

Tickets are always under $700 CAD return (my last ticket cost $540 return!). Planes are modern, clean, and spacious. There is plenty of overhead storage in the cabin unlike many other airlines (they don't bug you about slightly oversized carry-on items either). Meals are average, but not the worst for plane food. They also provide snacks. Staff is friendly. Seats are comfortable and wide with excellent leg room in Economy. Entertainment has standard 3.5mm audio jacks (use your own headphone) The only negative things that I've noticed is that boarding can take forever and sometimes the plane leaves late (for the most part the pilot makes up the time in the air and I've always arrived as scheduled). The in-flight entertainment system also has as limited selection, so I recommend you bring books or load you phone with media. In conclusion, this airline delivers a similar service to other well-renowned European airlines (KLM, Lufthansa, etc) and at a borderline-budget price too!

The biggest issue and really the reason I even chose to write this review is that they lost our luggage. The only reason we took this flight and the connecting one was because it was exclusively through Aer Lingus and we figured that with a 6 hour layover in Dublin they would have time to move our bags from one plane to the other. This was too much to ask, however, and despite being told they would transfer the bags they did not. (I am speaking for me and my friend) Once in Spain we learned that another passenger that flew from the UK and then connected to Barcelona from Dublin had the exact same issue, however his story was even stupider since he actually happened to see that his luggage had been unloaded and placed in the carousel in Dublin airport. Keep in mind this was just by chance, he grabbed his bag and told the staff that Air Lingus was supposed to have taken care of this and should have put it on the Barcelona bound plane. Despite him correcting this mistake and giving them another chance to fix it, they till forgot his bag in Dublin. That is pure incompetence. So now me and my friend are in Barcelona for a two month long study abroad, havent heard anything from Aer Lingus and have literally one change of clothes and nothing else.

They barely acknowledged the 35min delay on the inbound flight as though this is something usual for them. The return flight was 1h30min late. This could happen to any company, however they did not bother to give any information until 5min prior to boarding. The staff were stressed and they rushed the passengers. If any passenger dared display any sign of discomfort they were both dismissive and outright disrespectful. In my case, the rude behavior came when I tried to explain to the young man who simply stuck a tag to my very modestly sized carry on luggage to check it in for a lack space in the overhead compartment, that I had made sure my bag fits under the sit in front of me. But, he did not have time for a 10 seconds conversation. He stubbornly continued to harass me at the door of the plane and refused to hear a word. I did not give him way and ended up peacefully placing my bag under the sit in front of me. After that, they finally explained to us while in the plane that they had to change planes and we would have to sit in this plane another 40min before being allowed to take off. All this stress, the rude behavior, the rush to board so we can sit wait in the plane. It's one thing to be late, it's another thing to inflict such chaos and discomfort to customers.

We got over that as going on a holiday even though we knew that because of their delay we were going to miss out on a full night in our apartment. The real mess started when we boarded the plane. To start we were on the same row 13 with 2 of us on each side. The group of people sitting behind us were drunk when they were allowed on board and they sat directly behind our rows about 3 to 4 rows on each side and the worst was sitting right behind my seat. She was in her mid 40’s and I couldn’t believe the filthy language coming out of her mouth in such a small enclosed area. She was making constant burping noises, cursing, everything that she had to say was shouted or screamed and constant sexual remarks to the male passengers across and behind her. The head flight attendant knew these people were full of drink because before the flight even took off they were shouting and roaring so she comes down a row in front of us and starts telling them that she can take anyone she wants off now who are acting to loud or she has the power to divert the plane at any stage if she feels fit and then disappeared straight away and left the customers to listen to the filth for the rest of the flight (Unbelievable). Just before take off another flight attendant asked me was I ok and I turned around and said to her was she kidding me and with that also disappeared. Again same thing happened during the flight.  So we keep there the whole flight listening to this when 10 mins before landing the head flight attendant comes down to me and says are we ok which I really couldn’t believe just 10 mins to go so I tell her everything and said that it was a disgrace and she then says that people who were sitting 2 rows up from us that she moved them to the front of the plane because of the noise and brutal language. This I couldn’t believe as we were directly in front of the noise which I let her know. During all this my wife starts to cry infront of this attendant because of how upset she was that we were left there for the flight listening to all that was going on. In getting off the plane I also let the captain know and told him that it was a joke that he let them on the plane in the first place.

My lasting impression is that this is a no-frills airline trying to put on a show like they aren't a no-frills airline.

Cabin crew were very friendly and professional. They've got some good and experienced people working for them. We travelled in peak season so the flights weren't cheap, but outside of that time, they are one of the cheaper long haul airlines. Terms and conditions were made very clear during booking and check in. Connection through Dublin was easy and clear if a bit convoluted. Negatives: Pre-flight customer service was poor. Booking and online check in allowed for no seat selections to be made. At no point in the booking/check in process were we able to select seats, which was important to us due to the age and health of the travellers. Only through extended negotiation with contracted check-in staff at airport, who could see our needs, were we able to secure appropriate seats. Which left for a nerve-wracking build up to travelling. Special meal selections were inaccurate from booking - luckily we called up in advance to confirm. Food on outbound leg was good, but they ran out of the chicken option very quickly. Food on the way home was terrible. Entertainment selection is okay. The technology is poor, though. Had to reset my or my companions' screens at least once on each leg. Several functions did not work. Baggage handling is poor. Had a 2.5 hour wait at Toronto for baggage to come through. One lost bag. Despite which party was at fault, it was very poor customer service from Aer Lingus from that point on, with nobody to speak to at the company, and given telephone numbers cutting out upon connection.

So upon cancellation, we are instructed to collect our luggage and stand in an incredibly long line. Eventually, you learn from others that the line is only to receive a hotel voucher, and that they are providing no help in re-booking flights, with some excuse that it's not their expertise. By the time you learn this (hours into the line their customer service call center has closed for the night. They run out of hotel vouchers by the time you get to the front of the line, but that's irrelevant. As soon as you do get them on the phone, (at 2:30 AM) you are told they cannot help you because you booked using credit card points, and you must call your credit card. They were supposed to help you; they cancelled the flight, its their responsibility to re-book.  They later refuse to book me on another flight because they say I lacked a transit visa for Canada. Going on the Canadian government website and pointing out that US citizens do not need such a visa doesn't help,  because their goal is to avoid helping. These lies delayed our re-booking by hours, and we watched as flight after flight filled, pushing our departure back day after day. Their blatant effort to avoid having to pay another airline to re-book us has cost me the opportunity to be in Dublin for Bloomsday.",False,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Dublin,June 2017,,,,1,1,,False,

"""pick any other than Aer Lingus""",1,2017-05-19,"✅ Verified Review |  I was traveling on Vacation from JFK to LIN, and this was my very first time using Aer Lingus. I don't plan to ever fly with Aer Lingus again. Some things are understandable and are outside of an airline's control. Many of the issues I had experienced were purely poor customer service. Upon arrival at JFK airport, I was immediately turned off at the fact that Aer Lingus is not part of TSA-Pre, meaning I had to go through the standard security check which takes a very long time. So I finally make it to my gate, and I am waiting to start boarding the aircraft. Our flight was supposed to depart at 17:30. 17:30 rolls around and I had to go up and ask the attendant at the gate to find out the plane wasn't cleared to land and had to continue flying past JFK to Boston? I've never heard of this happening before, but I wasn't too irritated as my connecting flight didn't depart until 0700 Ireland time. Well, the flight delay went on for over two hours, and I ended up missing my connecting flight. The delay was understandable, and I assume not the fault of the airline, but communication in regards to the delay was nonexistent. Here is where the real frustration and poor customer service begins. A chaotic, disorganized line forms at the customer service counter to arrange for new connecting flights. This line is so poorly organized that many people were waiting in the wrong line for a half hour, and the flight attendants were the ones who directed them to those lines! Exhausted after an over two-hour delay as well as a 5-hour flight, I wait in this line for 4 hours. This is not an exaggeration but timed. Finally, we get to the front of the line and are told we can't fly out until tomorrow, causing us to lose a full day of our vacation. Aer Lingus in no way compensated us for this inconvenience, or loss of a vacation day, or even offered us one of those $5 drink vouchers, nothing. They sent everyone to the same hotel that couldn't fly out overnight, which was then overbooked and many had to leave that hotel to find accommodations for the evening. This isn't the end of my poor customer service experience. Arriving at the airport for the flight back, with two hours leeway till our flight leaves, we get into a line that wraps around the check-in counter and stretches all the way down through part of the hallway. Aer Lingus had 1 check in counter. There were three desks and only one attendant. I got to my gate right before they shut the doors. I could not imagine what I would have done if I missed that flight and was stranded in another country. Last but not least, the chance to leave feedback to Aer Lingus ended the day I landed back in JFK. I guess they expect me to rate my experience while I'm flying with them. All in all, pick any other than Aer Lingus, and I pray no one else has to go through what I had to go through and have travel completely ruin their vacation.",False,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Dublin,May 2017,2,3,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",1,1,,False,2

This is in reference to my flight with Aer Lingus El108 which was scheduled to depart on Tuesday, April 18th from JFK to Dublin, Ireland. Prior to departure I received an e.mail advising that the flight was delayed from 8:50 pm to 10:45pm. On arrival at the Airport my family and I were greeted by non Aer Lingus staff and handed a piece of paper apologizing for the disruption to our travel plans - the Flight had been cancelled and no explanation was given as to why. Included was an “800” number (800-585-0672) to call and rebook or get a refund. I immediately started to call the 800 number which constantly rang with no response - some people were put on hold for a considerable amount of time and had to end up hanging up. When I approached a representative from Aer Lingus, who was constantly on his cell phone and not very approachable, I was basically told they couldn't guarantee that I would get on another flight on April 19th (the next day). Our travel plans were time sensitive since we were attending my niece’s wedding and my sister was acting as the mother of the bride since my niece’s Mum has passed away. I had no choice but to rebook flights with another carrier so we were guaranteed to at least attend the wedding! I called Aer Lingus the following morning and finally got a response to find out that all Aer Lingus flights were already booked out. In addition, I was told that the representative at the Airport should have informed us that they would do all in their power to get us on a flight the next day. In this case Aer Lingus should be responsible for the extra charges that was imposed on us because of their lack of responsibility. I returned from my two week trip to discover that Customer Service didn't have the common courtesy to respond to my email nor had they refunded, as promised, the money for the flight that was cancelled. I had to waste my time and energy dealing with their incompetent customer service and had to explain my case again and demanded a refund. I finally got an email of apology about the cancelled flight and the importance of reliable and safe travel and that I'm in total agreement with, however, I have a difficult time dealing with disinterested staff who appear not to care about their customers. Since Aer Lingus did not make any effort to resolve this issue, in a timely fashion, I will no longer consider Aer Lingus as a carrier of choice, nor will I recommend Aer Lingus as a travel option to others. Quite honestly Aer Lingus lag behind their counterparts when it comes to inflight courtesy and customer service.

This is the second year I have flown with Aer Lingus and I plan to make it an annual event. From the service onboard to the lounges and service on the ground, both trips were superb. The Business Class cabin from Chicago to Dublin on the A330 is spacious and very comfortable with lie-flat seats. The left side of the plane consists of single seats, and I was happily ensconced in seat 3A. The middle section is double seats and the right section is a mixture of double and single seats. 99% of the seats have aisle access. The movie selection is less extensive than on other airlines, but there are still good choices. The food is excellent, the linens and cutlery very attractive and the FAs were smiling and helpful throughout the 7 hour flights. The Aer Lingus arrival lounge in Dublin is comfortable and had enough amenities to make the 2 hour layover on the way to Geneva very refreshing. There is no Business Class on the European flights but international Business passengers can select the premium seats at the front of the plane. Unlike British, Swiss and others, there is no charge for seat selection on Aer Lingus if traveling in Business. A few years ago, I paid $90 to have a window seat in British Airways' Club World cabin and have fumed about it ever since. Returning to the States is the best feature of Aer Lingus as you pass through U.S. Customs in their U.S. Pre-clearance area in Dublin and do not have to go through customs or passport control upon arrival in the States; you simply collect your luggage and leave the airport. The new Business Class lounge after U.S. Pre-clearance is superb. It is called 51st and Green and has a view of the runways from every seat and table. There is an excellent buffet, superbly stocked bar, terrific coffee and desserts, lounge chairs, shower room, and the staff is efficient and pleasant.

I was planning a day trip to London, and as I hadn’t travelled through Heathrow for over two years, I was curious to see how it had evolved since 09th July 2014 when Aer Lingus moved their operation from Heathrow Terminal 1 to Terminal 2. At the time, four main benefits arising from moving to T2 were heavily publicised:  Public transport within 15 minutes of landing. Luxurious Gold Circle Lounge within minutes of check in.  State of the art facilities. A seamless faster security and check in process. In addition, this was my first booking since the introduction of Aer Lingus’ loyalty programme, now named “Aer Club”. The booking process on Aer Lingus website remains broadly the same. The three fare types are now named Saver, Plus & Advantage with each earning a different amount of tier credits. One benefit I noticed is that when selecting the Plus fare, all seats are now included as complimentary: heretofore the front rows had to be paid for. As I was travelling within the 30 day window, I was able to check in immediately and print my boarding passes. I arrived at Dublin Airport at 7.00am for my 0845 am flight. I wanted to enquire about changing my seat on the outbound leg, and I called to the Gold Circle check in desk. Staff greeted me with a smile and within seconds had issued me with a new boarding card, and wished me a pleasant flight. My current Aer Club tier is Silver which includes fast track security. Only two people were in front of me and I was airside within a couple of minutes. I had a quick look around the bookshop and made my way to the Lounge, where I was greeted by the same staff with whom I dealt at the Gold Circle desk. We joked about the speed with which she moved from the check-in area to the lounge. Definitely the complete antithesis of the fabled lounge dragon! At approximately 8.20am, I made my way to gate 409 where boarding was underway. There are two separate boarding lines: General and Priority (for Aer Club members, flexible ticket holders) and it works very well. While walking towards the airbridge, passengers sitting in the rear half of the aircraft are directed towards steps at the rear door, and the front half board via the airbridge. This speeds up the boarding process, particularly on busy flights. The A320 was clean , and cabin crew warmly welcomed passengers. After a safety briefing and flight information from the Captain, we were underway quickly. During the flight, I indulged in the Irish Breakfast. Not the cheapest at 10 euro, but very tasty indeed.

About 40 mins before landing the man behind just pushed my wife's seat forward aggressively several times. We called the cabin crew, and the CSD came down to us. Despite the couple behind being quite drunk, and very aggressive, her way of dealing with the situation was to ask us to put our seats upright. We complied with her request and then had to put up with our seats being kicked and loud comments for the remainder of the flight.  This is the worst experience I have ever had on any airline, and it was compounded by the way it was dealt with. At no point did the CSD speak to them and ask them to calm down, nor did she ask them to stop disturbing us. It felt like we were being punished by the airline, and that the most aggressive passengers were being rewarded. If they were that drunk over three hours into the flight then it had to be due to drink sold onboard to  them, and this is unacceptable. I appreciate that the CSD did what they felt would easily diffuse the situation, and we complied with her request. However she should have made appropriate requests of the other passengers, and she did not.

It was only a sandwich that was requested by another passenger. Obviously there are good staff with Aer Lingus also, but this is spoilt by a poor few and bad practices. I would recommend management in Aer Lingus should get on a Singapore Airlines flight to see how it should be done, very well dressed staff throughout a long flight, very attentive and polite to any need or request, each one of them asked the name of our kids and used it when talking to them (Aer Lingus staff didn't bother to ask, the chewing gum was obviously in the way), very well organised at check in time even though dealing with a great deal more passengers and it didn't take six of them to do it either!

We called up Emirates and they said that, Aer Lingus had only made a reservation but had not ticketed it, so it got cancelled automatically. So we tried calling Aer Lingus again and after hours of being on hold, Aer Lingus finally said that we were booked on Air Canada for Jan 8th. So we went to the Airport and at the check in counter, the agent said that she could not find a ticket for our baby. So Aer Lingus, when re-issuing our ticket had re-issued only 4 tickets instead of 5 and had missed out on our infant. So we called them again to try to fly on the next flight, but they said that they could not do anything. Then we again went home at 10.30pm with the 3 children and all the luggage. The whole night we kept trying to call Aer Lingus and finally in the morning, they said that we had to buy a fully fresh ticket for our baby and that they would reimburse it. So we went to our agent to buy the ticket and somehow they fixed our infant's ticket for us.

I can't tell you the stress we were under and we tried over and over to call customer service, we were on hold without ever getting through. We were using precious cell phone minutes with no luck. Once we got to the airport, the counter was closed, we tried again, over and over to call, still no luck. So there we were with 4 adult flights that couldn't be honored. We had to rebook on another airline and spend another 10 hours via Germany to get to Dublin. This was at a great cost to us. We had a baby with us and my husband with a very serious heart condition. It was a very difficult situation which was made worse to not be able to communicate with anyone from Aer Lingus. If it were not for the help of a woman at the airport in Rome who finally connected with someone, we were told we were out luck. There's one flight out of Rome and tough luck if you miss it! Then once we were in Ireland and needing to check in, it was impossible. The website was difficult and again we couldn't get through to customer service. My daughter probably spent a few hours on the phone without ever reaching anyone. This is so unacceptable. I have been on buses that were more comfortable!

We arrived at Dublin airport around 5am and there were long lines for the Aer Lingus check-in desk even though we had checked in online we were shown to the main queue. A member of my group was using crutches and so standing in the line was uncomfortable. A member of Aer Lingus staff who was directing passengers to the various desks was extremely rude an was shouting at many of the passengers. We had pre-booked assistance for the member of our group using crutches but we asked the at the check-in desk there were steps to the plane - to which she told us that it was definitely an air bridge to the plane so accessibility wouldn't be an issue. We arrived at the gate to find that there was no air bridge to the plane and there was stairs down to the tarmac. To which a lady here was helpful but the member requiring assistance would have to wait behind. When the other staff scanned the passports there was a computer issue with one which the staff couldn't figure out. As my passport already scanned and I waited for my family member I was rudely told to ""Just go and board the plane!"". As I went down the stairs I was met by several different doors/corridors with no signage or member of staff to point us in the correct direction. After spending several minutes lost, myself and a few other passengers finally made it to the tarmac where two members of Aer Lingus ground staff were standing chatting then were again somewhat rude while taking us to the steps. Onboard we waited for the member of our group who required the assistance to get on to the plane. As she made her way down the aisle to sit beside us, she was told to ""just sit there"" in a row by herself about 5 rows away from us. Because she was not seated beside us we were not able to help getting bags/crutches from the overhead locker and no staff helped. The return flight was no improvement on Aer Lingus part. As the flight was full we couldn't place the crutches in the locker, after trying to get the attention of the crew and being ignored, my family member had to sit with the crutches upright in front of her for the whole journey - which wasn't even remarked upon by cabin crew doing the usual ""tray up, bags away safety check"". Furthermore, staff were extremely rude. As this flight was departing late in the evening and was delayed a lady in the seat across the aisle from me had fallen asleep before takeoff. A male crew member then proceeded to stop during the safety demonstration, stomp over to her, nip her arm and shake her quite aggressively, rudely telling her pay attention!

Aer Lingus customer review,9,2015-08-27,"I hadn't travelled Aer Lingus Business Class for about 15 years and was looking forward to a trip down memory lane as I used to do the Dublin to JFK route regularly. The trip had been planned for ages, and I had checked and double checked the arrangements with the Airline about 4-5 times as I had booked through an agent and all seemed in order. Arrived Saturday morning and had a painless check in and bag drop and soon found ourselves in the T2 Business Class lounge which is nice and well appointed. The food offering is nowhere near as good as other lounges with limited cold stuff available. We were called to go through Immigration at 09.30 and the idea of doing this in Dublin rather face the queues at JFK is still pure genius. This was quick and efficient and couldn't be faulted and we were in the boarding area within 15 minutes before being called to Board the EI105 at 10.00. We were greeted by the Cabin Service Manager who showed us to our seats in 2H and 2K. Jackets were taken and we were offered a drink by the lovely Senior Cabin crew member who looked after us throughout the flight. Take off was on time. Shortly after take off we were offered drinks and a smal dish of canapés. I was a bit surprised that my Vegetarian partner was offered the fish ones, and at this stage we discovered that the many times confirmed Lacto Vegetarian meal had not been loaded. The crew said not to worry and they would sort something out. The lunch menu offered a choice of starters of Chicken Liver Pate or Burren Smokehouse hot and cold smoked salmon which is pictured. My partner was offered the cheese plate from the dessert offering. I had the Salmon which was great. Mains were a choice of Collar of Irish Bacon, Lambay Island Irish Lamb Stew or a Luxury Crisp fish pie - the crew recommended the bacon which is pictured and was delicious. At this point my partner was advised that the Vegetarian meal had been found (looked like in economy) and it was just the tray that was missing. He was served a Vegetarian pasta dish which he said was fine Dessert was a choice of Lemon Tart or Cheese Plate both of which wee good and there was a rather nice Sancerrre on offer with lunch which was also good This was the new style business class but it would appear that Aer Lingus has ditched the idea of dining on demand as this was not offered. The new seat is brilliant though a massive lie flat bed, that is really comfy, together with a big screen to enjoy a decent selection of television in demand, and free wifi for business class customers. There is also a selection of snacks in the galley now - crisps sandwiches fruit - that kind of thing. About an hour before landing we were served a rather odd Super Power Salad of quinoa, courgette and feta cheese which wasn't the tastiest thing I had ever had on a plane, but the scones that accompanied it were great. We landed in JFK at 13.15 and we were out of Terminal 5 and in Terminal 4 with bags at 13.35 which was absolutely superb.

The former proud little airline hit hard times and sought to revive its fortunes as ""ultra low cost carrier"", thus taking on Ryanair head to head - what a stupid idea. Legroom is so tight. There is no inflight entertainment of any kind, the cabin was not fresh, and absolutely everything - from water on down, must be purchased from sometimes surly staff.

The service was excellent and the food was great. So when I booked our trip in May 2015 to Italy through Dublin to Naples I was excited. I could not have been more disappointed. The service was terrible. There was only 1 flight attendant that gave a faint smile (and that was on all legs of the trip. A British staff member was on board for the final Dublin to Boston flight via Titan Airlines. They were a breath of fresh air and were very pleasant and actually smiled). The food was bad. The plane was pretty clean though. This was the cheapest airline I have flown on. They kept charging for everything. On the flight from Dublin to Naples they charged for every single thing even water. Not one thing was distributed for free. I could see if I paid very little for my flight but this was not a cheap rock bottom fare. Frankly I was ashamed of being Irish after I took the first leg of the trip. We were traveling with 10 other people and all agreed that they would have no interest in traveling to Ireland for a future vacation. So Aer Lingus - you might be saving a lot of money but you are obliterating anyone's desires to travel to Ireland in the future.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,7,2015-05-16,10/5 Sunday flight Dublin to LHR. Went to book luggage in and was grabbed and asked if I wanted to be put on the earlier flight which was good. I had previously paid for a seat upfront but only got row 9 in the reorg which was odd as there were spare seats on the earlier flight. Bad news - loads of planes leaving at that time so really only gained about half an hour but hey not their fault. Usual problem though - people with too much luggage and no idea of how to stow on board. They did weigh some and grab some but I feel they need to monitor this when people get on the plane as some people really are quite selfish and clueless. Also Aer Lingus passengers take forever getting on or off a plane which actually does matter if you have trains and buses to get. However cheaper than Ryanair and quite pleasant.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,1,2015-05-13,We flew Dublin to Paris on May 13th 2015. From the start we were greeted with disinterested and unfriendly staff at check in. Even though I checked in with my husband we were not seated next to each other even though the plane wasn't full. I moved myself over to sit with him before take off but why would they seat us apart? The cabin crew were miserable. Finally they rush through with the tea and coffee and snacks that you have to purchase and staff didn't even bother to ask us if we would like something. The plane itself was disgustingly dirty with drink stains spilled on the seat. The back of the seats holding the magazines was vile with what looked like a mixture of spilt drink food and mould. We will never fly Aer Lingus again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,2,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,7,2015-05-10,I traveled from Munich to Boston in early January 2015. The experience at Munich airport was very poor particularly the passport control line which was 45 minutes of unrestrained and uncontrolled pushing and shoving. Probably not Aer Lingus' fault but still a poor start. I had paid for a business class ticket over the internet. Did not find out until getting on the plane that the first part of the trip (Munich to Dublin) was economy as there are no business class seats on the plane. Typical economy experience. The actual business class portion of the trip (Dublin to Boston) was excellent. However the fare (which looked reasonable initially) in retrospect seemed far too high given that 3 hours of the 9 hour trip were actually not business class. I had a medical issue that caused me to book the business class ticket so I was really horrified at the unexpected 3 hours in economy which I had bought the business class ticket specifically to avoid.,False,,,Business Class,,,3,4,,,3,,False,

The urge to throw-up a feeling not welcomed by most especially not at 30000+ altitude was overwhelming and a sense of unwanted panic set in. Luckily I was accompanied by my boyfriend whom along with the diligent and empathetic flight crew got me back on track for the remainder of the flight.

Aer Lingus customer review,5,2015-04-22,Sunday flight 18.00 from Dublin to Heathrow. Late boarding apparently due to inbound plane being late which is odd as it arrived on time. Then the most ridiculous shambles of boarding that took forever. If people have paid for seats then they should get on first especially as some people are greedy with hand luggage and seem incapable of stowing it correctly. Finally after a good wait I got to get on the plane to find the lady on my row had blocked an entire area by putting her case in the wrong way round! Why is this not monitored? Its about time this boarding procedure was improved upon. Its the same old story.

Aer Lingus customer review,,2015-04-14,Flew from Rome to Dublin with Aer Lingus on Friday 10th April. Very slow check-in with a huge queue. More importantly I can't understand why Aer Lingus make you check-in in Terminal Three and then make you walk the whole way back to Terminal one to board plane to Dublin - this is a long trudge from Terminal three through terminal two to terminal one. You would need a up to an hour to do this walk. (including long security check line). When you fly into Rome you go into terminal one and can exit there. When we finally got to gate the staff insisted on taking carry-on bags from some people (but not all) because the flight was full. In the end the overhead lockers were half empty but some people had a long wait for their luggage. Aer Lingus need to improve their ground facilities in Rome and move the check in desk to terminal one adjacent to the gate.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,1,,,2,,False,

I have never experienced anything like it. A smile must cost them a million or cause them a lot of pain. Maybe it's these ugly uniforms. The service is minimal with one meal on a transatlantic flight and most of the flight you could not find the flight attendants other than in the galley. I have also never experienced a flight with so many passengers with bladder problems. Of course they don't go to the airport bathrooms to them it is much nicer to go in the plane so minutes after take-off they start to go and go and go.

Aer Lingus customer review,2,2015-04-03,Travelled MCO-DUB with an infant. Check in all ok at the airport but once on the plane the partner of the man seated next to me in row 2 made a huge fuss about my son (who was sitting quietly and minding his own business) being in the cabin to which the female crew member replied 'I agree but there's nothing I can do about it'.

Aer Lingus customer review,2,2015-03-30,29 March 2015. I was booked to go YYZ-DUB yesterday. Flight was cancelled.

The staff checked in all but 9 of us who happened to be from yesterday's cancelled flight. A long time later they managed a flight to London Heathrow tonight with Air Canada boarding at 10.40 pm. I'm going to arrive in Heathrow at 11am and board an Aer Lingus flight for Dublin arriving at 2.45 tomorrow. I'm really not sure what to do when travel goes pear-shaped but Aer Lingus oversold the flights and nine of us unrelated and obviously not aggressive or over-assertive ended up in a horrendous nightmare.

The service is great and they always smile & welcome everyone on board unlike the other Irish airline. However one major concern from the end of March '15 the 06.50 flight will cease to operate and the first flight of the day to Dublin will be at 09.10 which is useless for those of us going to work in Dublin.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,3,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,4,2015-03-20,Flew Dublin Boston with 3 month old two year old and husband. Having informed infant travelling and confirmed bassinet seat boarded plane to be told sorry not bassinet row after all. Plane change the previous evening and row numbering differed with new aircraft and bassinet rows were not allocated appropriately for new aircraft. We were lucky that kind passengers (with no accompanying infants) eventually gave up their bassinet row seats. Contacted Aer Lingus before the return leg of the journey to request bassinet row for the journey home - customer service response was poor in relation to the matter. When we checked in on flight home and we requested to be sat together if possible we were informed there were four children travelling in bassinet seats and my husband would have to sit in row behind me (my 3 month old) and my two year old. We were fine with this as we understood priority to be given to adults with accompanying infants but once we boarded flight it became obvious one bassinet row occupied by 2 infants (our row) and the other bassinet row given to adults with no accompanying infants. It would have made our trip home a little easier to have been seated together as anyone with children knows. We travelled from the UK to Dublin to support Irish company but we will not fly with Aer Lingus again. Previous travel for us with British Airways to US was predictable and turned out to be superior.

Aer Lingus customer review,8,2015-03-04,Overall surprisingly a great experience - emphasis on the surprise. Flying Boston to Edinburgh with a layover in Dublin. Checked in online was almost immediately sent an email and text informing me my flight was delayed 40 minutes. Arrive at the airport and am continuously informed of further delays. The plane was late getting in and they flipped it as quickly as they could somehow managing to get fresh blankets and pillows in every seat although they did not have time to get fresh headsets on board before takeoff. By the time we got off the ground we were 2 hours behind schedule. Despite this we were informed that we would only be half an hour behind schedule due to favorable weather. This was not the case we were over an hour late. Upon arrival in Dublin almost everyone on the plane were given tickets for new flights since literally all of us missed our connections due to the delays. I was booked on the next flight out of Dublin (which was still a 5 hour wait) and given vouchers in 5 euro increments for breakfast as compensation for the inconvenience. Everyone with whom I spoke during the delay the confusion and the ticket transferring was absolutely a joy seriously one of the best customer service experiences I have had while flying. The food on the flight was great for airline food and in the course of a 5 hour flight we were given a beverage and snack service dinner coffee/tea and morning juice.

Aer Lingus customer review,,2015-02-18,Dublin to JFK. The pre US clearance actually makes the flights more confusing as you have to give yourself over 2 hours to clear that area then find the appropriate gate. This is NOT printed on your boarding card and the distances in this airport are lengthy. Business class desk woman was extremely rude and so were the 2 customer service desk attendees that I dealt with to change my flight. Internet has never worked on these flights for me my vegetarian requests have been missed 4 out of 5 times and the general level of Irish customer service is extremely low. They speak to you as if it is a privilege to pay them to fly with them. Do not fly with Aer Lingus if you need to ask a representative for anything.

Lovely meal and a few hours sleep on the near flat beds. I understand this year they will move to fully flat. Arrive in JFK as a domestic passenger so seamless to public transport or a cab.

Aer Lingus customer review,10,2015-01-26,SNN-BOS: I booked the flight on the Aer Lingus website and the cost was very reasonable. Check in was quick and efficient in less than 5 minutes same with security and US Immigration which is a real bonus. The flight was operated by Air Contractors for Aer Lingus 757 which is a smaller aircraft to the traditional A330 Aer lingus used to use on the route. I chose to sit in the back cabin of the aircraft as most people were sitting up at the front and the middle of the aircraft the few of us at the back had a row of three seats each. The seat pitch was fine (and mush better compared to the Qantas A380 which I was on two weeks prior). The pre order meal is well worth the extra money especially for the west bound flight it includes wine and has proper cutlery and is served on porcelain and the meal is served individually before the standard meals. In-flight entertainment was touch screen (there was no remote and the head sets is plugged into the side of the screen) with a good choice of movies: there are some new releases and a good few classic movies with the usual array of sitcoms music and the in-flight map. Crew were friendly and professional throughout the flight chatting with the passengers throughout the service. There was a small snack of a large flapjack with tea or coffee before landing. Overall a good service comfortable aircraft (despite the smaller size of the 757 there was a nice area near the aft restrooms to stretch your legs) good seat pitch (I am 6 ft) and it is well worth upgrading your meal.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,True,

Ordered pre-order meals - they were ok I'm still not a fan of Clodagh McKennas inflight menu but it filled the gap. Unless you are in the 1st 3 rows they don't generally have much left when they come around. As I had booked wheelchair assistance for my mother I wasn't surprised that on arrival Swissport who do the handling do not have any lifts to take the passengers off the flight this is a regular occurrence at Agadir out of Aer LIngus's remit I reckon.

Aer Lingus customer review,6,2015-01-05,"JFK-DUB - First time flying Aer Lingus transatlantic and being Irish was looking forward to the service having previously flown Delta BA and Air France. I have to say I was pretty disappointed. It may be a good service to those who haven't flown other airlines long haul. I found the seats cramped and uncomfortable. The PTV touchscreen was very unresponsive. They went around and gave one measly plastic cup of soft drink and advised those who wanted to ""buy"" wine for dinner they better do so now. Dinner arrived around an hour later (way too late as on a night flight everyone wants to get some sleep). By the time dinner came everyone had obviously finished their drinks and couldn't get another one with their dinner. The cabin crew didn't look too happy. When dinner was handed out and rubbish collected they disappeared for the rest of the flight. No water nothing. In comparison I flew Delta out and they were miles better complimentary wine with dinner (and a second and third if you wanted it). They came around with free drinks very soon after take off and dinner promptly after that. They served drinks with dinner and were very attentive throughout the rest of the flight handing out refreshments. They were also very friendly.

After 2 very enjoyable weeks in Ireland travelled Dublin to Edinburgh with a party of 20 on Aer Lingus. 16 had an extra bag booked and all those were well underweight. One person had an extra bag not overweight but not booked for which the additional charge was 320 euros. This was negotiated down to 270 euros and we were advised that the charge would have been wiped had we flown into Ireland using Aer Lingus. To put the extra charge in perspective the price of a return ticket plus bag on the net that day was 119 euros.

Food was pretty bad mostly tasteless slop for the main meal and an insulting muffin and coffee/tea for ""afternoon tea"" which was literally thrown at some people. We could watch movies/TV free but the headset quality was atrocious we couldn't hear clearly (same for announcements which could be a safety hazard). I switched to my own headset so I can confirm that this was an airline problem. Attendants were inattentive - on the night time outbound trip they disappeared so no water could be had overnight (there was no-one at the back of the plane). They were also curt and unsmiling - except when I tried to board when they stopped the passengers immediately ahead of me and went into a whole ""Irish"" routine which went on for a while.

Aer Lingus customer review,6,2014-12-10,Dublin to Paris CDG return. I paid for a flexible ticket which costs more than twice the ordinary fare. By right this should be equivalent to business class fare. However Aer Lingus operates an economy only seating on this route. It used to include 2 checked bangs of 20 kgs each. Not anymore as you only get one 20kg bag now. With this fare you get lounge access but you still have to purchase food and drinks on the plane. Outbound flight was largely ok. On the return trip I was very annoyed to discover that the overhead bin was full and as I was on seat 1C there was no front seat I could put my small carry on luggage under. Eventually the stewardess managed to squeeze it in an overhead bin above the seat behind. I find this unacceptable as obviously no proper checks were carried out allowing people to carry disproportionately more stuff on board and thus depriving others from getting their fare share of space. It irritated me even more that I had paid over the odds to discover that there was no space for my small carry on luggage above my seat. I have to agree with strict policies regarding carry on luggage as is with Ryanair. I guess I will still continue flying Aer Lingus as there are not too many options on this route but Aer Lingus should probably have a small business class cabin so that those who pay more get that bit more for the extra they fork out for their ticket. Alas I am unlikely to see this in my lifetime. In summary I think the worst thing an airline can do is combining a low cost approach while still charging extra for which you don't get much more. If Aer Lingus wants to be a real low cost airline that's fine but don't charge more and give nothing much in return.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,2,,False,

Aer Lingus customer review,2,2014-10-31,We travelled Newcastle-Dublin-Chicago early October and chose Aer Lingus because of the option to do Immigration in Dublin. What a disappointment. At US Immigration in Dublin we were handed Customs Forms. The guy handing them out had no idea what they were for or who had to fill them in. The Immigration process however was fairly straightforward and much quicker than we've experienced in the US. Once on board what a disappointment. We waited almost two hours before the flight attendants came around with the drinks trolley. They only came around once in an eight hour flight. And we had to pay for the drinks. This is the first time we've had to do this on a Transatlantic flight. They never came around with complimentary water or juice. I asked the attendant for some water which she brought to me but when the lady in front asked for water she was told they'd stopped serving drinks!! Lunch was pretty grim and afternoon tea was a flapjack - pretty hard to swallow when you're thirsty! On a positive note when we landed in Chicago we collected our luggage and were on our way pretty quickly. The return overnight flight was no better then our flight from Dublin to Newcastle was delayed because of an incident in Dublin airport. We were sitting in a very cold aircraft for over an hour.

Flights departed and left on time. Boarding was more chaotic as patrons waited while families with infants and those in wheelchairs boarded early but brought with them large extended families as well to take advantage of the early boarding. October 25 the return flight from Amsterdam only allows check in with KLM but Aer Lingus passengers find out too late that they cannot print boarding passes from the hotel but only at blue KLM machines in the airport.

Aer Lingus customer review,,2014-10-31,For an international carrier it must rate as the poorest value. The audacity of them to charge for alcoholic beverages and the gall of them to recommend you spend €18 odd on what they call a decent meal when most national carriers provide the same free. I was travelling with some friends from Australia and they were taken aback by the frugality of the meals and beverages.

Aer Lingus customer review,10,2014-10-28,3/10/14 London Heathrow to Dublin Flight EI155. I am fed up with the Aer Lingus bashing on this site. Whilst conceding that I am Irish and could be accused of bias on the number of occasions over the last few years I have flown with Aer Lingus I can truthfully say that the overall service has been outstanding. Flight delays are usually outside the control of the airline. The crews without exception have been warm friendly and totally professional. I have enjoyed flying with Aer Lingus and look forward to doing so again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,7,2014-10-28,"Flew CWL-DUB-JFK and YYZ-DUB-CWL business class. Had the opportunity to bid for upgrade which we did and was accepted. The flight from CWL was on Stobart Air new plane and surprisingly quite a bit of leg room and seat comfort. We chose this route so we could clear immigration in DUB which was very easy to do and then sit in the BC lounge until ready to fly. The trip over was great comfortable seats which laid flat wi-fi 5 course meal on real plates and a tasty snack before we landed. The cabin crew were delightful nothing was too much trouble. The IFE was ok I mainly listened to music which had some great artists on there and some relatively new releases. I did not watch a film as I was too busy playing email tag with friends taking advantage of the wi-fi. Arrived at JFK on time and breezed through the terminal to collect luggage and to meet our waiting transfer. Return journey YYZ-DUB-CWL. Business lounge in YYZ airport is run by KLM massive lounge with great selection of food and drinks. The return plane was a different configuration and older so BC was not as comfortable in my opinion. There were only 12 seats and 2 were empty we were in row 1 and the screen for the IFE was so far away I could barely see it. One member of staff to care for our needs she was rather offhand and sourfaced not like that smilers we had coming over. Dinner was served it was ok but not to the standard of the outward flight and the seats were not as comfortable due to the fact that when you did use the recline/lie flat you were placed at an angle that made you feel as if you were about to slide on the floor. During the flight I asked for a cup of coffee (I dont sleep) and she said I will be serving breakfast in 30 minutes would you like yours now I said no just the coffee. When she served breakfast she did not give me mine so had to ask when she replied ""oh you said you did not want breakfast"". When we arrived at DUB we had to go through security again despite having just gotten off a plane and only being in transit. Due to the plane being slightly late we only had 15mins to get to our gate. Our bags were scrutinised and my friends duty free was checked to see if the seal had been broken and the receipt matched with the label. Very irritating we did end up being slightly late to our gate (we had our boarding passes) but it was stress we could have done without. The flight back to CWL was with Stobart Air packed but no problems. All in all not bad for the price we paid as the outward journey balanced the return.",False,,,Business Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,True,

Aer Lingus customer review,7,2014-10-22,Kerry-Dublin-Kerry on 14th October. Flight is Aer Lingus Regional operated by Stobart Air. Flights departed and arrived on time and were relatively smooth. Transit through Kerry and Dublin airports (with no luggage) was easy. The aircraft was uncomfortably hot during the early morning flight from Kerry.

Aer Lingus customer review,9,2014-10-22,Used the BHX-DUB flight taking about an hour and just wanted to say what a pleasant experience it was compared to the competition on this route. No check-in queue or problems even though I was late due to a delayed train. A relaxed and pleasant experience throughout. No being herded onto stairwells so that the airline can stick to its tight schedules - just walked straight onto the plane after a short wait. The plane itself was a newish ATR 72-600 with an easy-on-the-eye light grey/blue interior - not the oppressive yellow and blue of the competition. Also no jarring announcements or being pestered to buy scratch cards. National carriers are also often a small window on the country to which you are travelling so it was nice to have staff that were actually Irish. Terminal 2 in Dublin is also much easier than T1. A relaxing experience and good all round - well worth the extra few euros (although actually cheaper than FR for this particular trip).,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,5,,True,

Aer Lingus customer review,9,2014-10-12,Flew from Belfast City Airport to Palma. The flight was delayed on the way out although it was confirmed that this was due to the airport the plane was leaving to come to Belfast to pick us up and in the end it was only just over an hour due to a speedy turn around by Aer Lingus staff. The aircraft was clean and tidy and not at all tired looking a good job especially given the short turnaround time that staff had. Flight was comfortable with a decent enough level of leg room although the cabin did feel a little hot on both out and inbound flights. The food selection was decent and of a standard a little higher than I would have normally expected although perhaps in the grander scheme of things like most airlines a little pedestrian. The return flight was much the same no problems and nothing to further stress my wife and I while travelling with our toddler for her first time on a plane. Also a few days after landing I contacted Aer Lingus as we seemed to have misplaced a new pair of shoes we had bought in Palma airport for our daughter. Usually some airlines are impossible to deal with after the fact however Aer Lingus were helpful and really gave the impression they went the extra mile to see if they could locate our misplaced shoes.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,

Aer Lingus customer review,8,2014-10-05,Two flights the first EI 564 DUB-BCN and the other EI 739 PMI-DUB. The first took off late due to the late arrival of the aircraft which was the truth (refreshingly) as the aircraft only arrived 20mins before we were due to depart but the time was made up with a fairly quick two hour flight to BCN. Not a full flight so we had space to move and didn't have the usual cabin baggage issues. Took the cabin crew a while to get going with inflight service but they had everything we asked for. The crew were nice if a little robotic. Plane wasn't spotless but they were in a hurry to go again so understandable (it wasn't filthy either). The flight back was packed and the airport in Palma is awful one of the warmest airports I've set foot in. The usual issues with pax and their cabin baggage while this is not the fault of the crew it should be dealt with or pax should know how to stow their luggage efficiently. It seems to rather aggravate the cabin crew that they are reduced to baggage handlers and rightly too. Otherwise there were similar crew-bots to the ones on the way over. Did everything by the book and kept the lights low for anyone who wanted to sleep. As per usual the bags took an age to arrive and this seems to be quite a regular occurrence now. But as an experience but flights were absolutely fine and pretty good value for money.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,,2014-10-05,Booking experience is horrific. We've flown with this airline 8 times this year and each time there are many mistakes in the booking process. Their website is worse than useless it throws a litany of errors and seemingly holding parts of your information input which confounds the website next time you access it. This last booking it lost seat reservations and despite many emails are unable to get a simple request like sitting together right. They charge for meals and don't provide them. Onboard all is well nice friendly staff on clean planes. Food is just acceptable. Best way is take your own and have a picnic. All our flights have been on time.

Unbelievably the woman in front reclined her seat (its a short flight) and reduced my space even further. Plane more or less on time however landed at terminal one and walked miles to terminal 2 - no logic. 21st September Sunday flight - Queuing had been slightly addressed but loading was held back because of there only being one member of staff instead of two checking in and people just being slow. Arrived late which led to a few people having to run the length of Gatwick to get to their trains.

The price was right but you get what you pay for. The food was worse than TV dinners the stewardesses were so unfriendly (on both flights) and the TV's did not work on the flight back so we could not watch movies.

Both flights were the worst that my wife and I have experienced. The flight attendants were rude inefficient unprofessional inattentive and were completely aloof to what was going on around them. For example I pushed our flight attendant buzzer at least 10 different times to no avail. We were completed ignored. The food service was a farce and disgrace. One passenger wanted a blanket asked for a blanket but never received one. Another passenger asked for a cup of tea several times and after 30 mins or so it finally arrived.

Returning to Florida and had to go through JFK and connect to JetBlue who does not have business class so you are in the way back in coach .

Aer Lingus customer review,10,2014-09-06,Well what to say a single Business Class flight to JFK from Dublin. Ordinarily I would hate such flights but the price and nature of the Aer Lingus flight was exceptional the cabin crew were dedicated and tended to my every need providing a friendly a fun flight to New York. The seats were very comfortable and I was greeted with champagne upon arrival the inflight entertainment was highly varied with some real classic films as well as many block buster movies and TV shows. The flight departed on time. The only slight drawback currently is the fact the seats do not lie completely flat that being said you still have more than enough room to relax. When I raised this with staff they discussed how their will apparently soon be changes made to put in place those seats that do lie completely flat as other airlines have begun to put them into place.

Aer Lingus customer review,3,2014-09-01,Have flown with Aer Lingus round trip from Boston to UK 3 times prior to our flight in August. The return trip from Dublin to Boston was not what we usually experience with Aer Lingus. The flight attendants were not helpful. They were slow distributing the snack which turned out to be only drinks didn't offer anyone a snack. They did not hand out blankets. Told passengers to get them themselves. Distributed the meal slowly and it was well into the flight before we ate. Ran out of choices so we got stuck with a beef meal that was inedible. The flight encountered some turbulence so seat belt naturally went on. Yet the pilot took his time turning that sign off when the turbulence cleared. It seemed like we were confined to our seats for most of the trip. That also seemed to make the attendants happy.

Aer Lingus customer review,2,2014-08-28,Travelled from Birmingham UK to Dublin on Flt EI263. This flight was strictly ok and seemed like one of cheap airlines. It was a short flight but the passengers were very loud noisy but our connecting flight from Dublin to SFO Flt EI147 was a nightmare. After two security checks and a very slow US immigration Customs we went to the gate and the flight was delayed 90 minutes. Once on the plane it was freezing cold and there were no blankets on the seats for passengers. Cabin crew kept saying the heat would start soon but that never happened. We were travelling with kids and they were shivering. After repeatedly complaining the staff gave us some extra blankets which helped a little bit. We had ordered Hindu Vegetarian meals but we were given meals with chicken as they had no veggie meals onboard and nobody was apologetic. On this long flight we were given only one tasteless meal that the kids hardly ate and one snack bar before landing. No snacks or treats for kids during the flight.

Aer Lingus customer review,8,2014-08-28,NCL-DUB-NCL (Operated by Stobart Air). Short hop across the Irish Sea. By far a more preferable experience to that offered by Ryanair: no check in queue pleasant staff on-time boarding and departure and arrival into the new Terminal 2 at Dublin airport. Bags also delivered rapidly at both ends. On-board the (brand new) ATR aircraft the seats were comfortable and spacious. A bar and snack service (for cash) was offered. The only slight niggle was the ridiculously long Aer Lingus check in queue on the return home (Sunday evening). 50 minutes from start to finish. They do have a 'late check-in' desk and regularly have to announce flights that are closing and direct people to this desk to avoid missing flights!,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,2,2014-08-26,Flew from Dublin to Palma Majorca. Flight left at 7.30am about 6-7 drunken young men allowed to board. One fellow spent the whole 3 hours of the flight yelling back and forth to his buddies swearing every second word it seemed and there were small children sitting right in front of him. Everyone around very uncomfortable. Three hours of drunken louts around us and staff incapable of dealing with them they continued to serve them alcohol. He wasn't met at the arrival gate by security like he would have been in most places. After the horrible flight our luggage did arrive but it did take almost an hour to arrive at luggage collection so not sure if that was Aer Lingus or airports fault. No onboard flight entertainment (3 hour flight would have been nice) and food was all to be paid for but that's ok since it wasn't a long flight.

Aer Lingus customer review,9,2014-08-26,My wife daughter and I travelled from Gatwick to Chicago via Dublin on 23rd July. The flight to Dublin had 'no frills' but was more comfortable than a recent flight on another Irish budget airline. The 3 hours transfer time at Dublin was partially taken up with clearing US immigration and the rest with sitting waiting for the on time flight to Chicago. The cabin crew were mature and efficient and the meal was very acceptable and served two hours into the flight. When we arrived on time in Chicago because all the paperwork had been done we were able to walk out of the airport without hassle after collecting our baggage. The return flight on 14th August had a younger cabin crew who provided a more lively friendly but equally efficient service. The Beef meal was very tasty and the cheese and ham croissant just before landing was welcome. A word of warning during the transfer at Dublin outbound and inbound further scanning was carried out on our hand baggage. The duty free bottle was accepted as the seal on the bag had not been broken and we had the receipt but a small bottle of wine from the aircraft which I had kept to drink later was confiscated even though it was unopened. I had read some of the 'horror reviews before flying but our experience did not match them and we would happily fly with the Aer Lingus again.

Aer Lingus customer review,3,2014-08-26,We flew Aer Lingus for our trip to Europe. We are a family of 4 with extensive travel experience. The tickets were not very cheap to begin with. We wanted to fly into London and fly out of Paris. For this the fare difference between Aer Lingus and Virgin British Airways was about $25-40 per person. Having flown with them I have now decided it would have been better to have flown with BA or Virgin. The flight from SFO to DUB and back is a long haul flight. On this flight we were offered one meal and one breakfast bar. The staff don't ask for Water or any other beverage from time to time. I saw other passengers bringing their own food drink etc.. They are probably used to traveling on this airline and are adequately prepared. The quality of entertainment is poor and the system they use is slow to respond. From time to time it hangs and we had to ask the crew to reboot the system. I guess we have been used to superior service from BA Singapore Airlines Cathay Air New Zealand and were disappointed even though the difference pricewise was not much.

Aer Lingus customer review,2,2014-08-18,Sunday flight 19.00 17/8. I dread going home with Aer Lingus as there is usually a scrum to get on the plane as the regulars do not understand the meaning of the word queue and the staff don't control the amount of luggage each passenger takes onboard leading to the ritual scratching of heads when their oversized hand luggage doesn't fit in the overhead locker and delay as bags have to be stowed. Why does this continue? When eventually the passengers were on board (it takes forever as many cant count) we then had to listen to the captain boasting about how he was going to get us there early - of course he didn't. Cut the showing off - control the passengers hand luggage and teach them and the staff some manners. Far too expensive for this nonsense - get professional.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,3,,False,

I flew Aer Lingus DUB-BOS-DUB in August 2014. It has good staff reasonable planes and routes. But it is really badly let down by its archaic web site with no access to your booking or seat selection before check in tacky interiors with seat pockets hanging off cramped seats some the worst airplane food I have ever had the misfortune to eat. On my transatlantic flight I ended up sitting for 6 hours on the way out in a seat that didn't recline with the person in fronts seat wedged in my face. On the way back I was determined not to let this happen again so chose a middle aisle seat with apparently (on the online check-in website) had seats behind and in front However instead I got a lovely seat beside the toilet which didn't recline as there was a bulkhead behind not shown on their plan. Online check-in is worthless as you still have to queue up in Boston and your carefully printed ticket is torn up and binned.

Returning from New Zealand I flew Air NZ Premium Economy to SFO (normally I go All Air NZ AKL to SFO/LAX to LHR-Belfast). However this trip I availed of Aer Lingus' new service from SFO to DUB to cut out a flight. Seats were incredibly cramped and uncomfortable with very small seat pitch and minimal recline which the passenger beside me commented on also as they boarded. Food was utterly disgusting my alleged beef Stroganoff actually tasted worse than it looked which was no mean feat I didn't even attempt a 2nd mouthful. Wine was extra $5USD. For a long haul flight costing over $900USD one way I think this is a bit mean ""breakfast"" was a joke a cling film wrapped ham and cheese roll and about 100ml of water in a foil sealed plastic tub tossed out.

There we absolutely no Aer Lingus or any other airport employees in the gate area during this time. The security personnel-the only non passengers we could access - refused to assist the passengers as we all became increasingly frustrated at the lack of information. We made phone calls to the Vienna airport (they must share the blame for this debacle as well) and Aer Lingus. No one offered any help whatsoever. Aer Lingus has apparently trained their employees to respond to any question or concern with a very irritating reply: ""We understand that you are frustrated"". This is all we heard from Aer Lingus employees throughout this flight. Not one Aer Lingus employee responded with appropriate action. At check in we were promised help with a seating request that I had tried to manage multiple times before arrival. No help was ever provided. The hot meal was frustrating as well.

Thankfully got one of the last seats on the direct flight on the return journey. Business class wasn't in the budget for this trip but the seats in economy were fine (I'm 6'0'' tall). I ordered one of the special meals for the Boston flight which was well worth it had the regular meal from SFO to DUB which was fine and you could help yourself to drinks and snacks from the galley at any time. The service is consistent the aircraft's always immaculate the personal entertainment has plenty of choice and the staff generally very friendly and helpful. You can select most seats on the aircraft for free at time of booking. Lets hope AL go daily on this route in 2015.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,3,,True,

Aer Lingus customer review,3,2014-07-22,"We have been flying with Aer Lingus since 1999 and until last month we always considered it our favorite airline. The flight crew and planes have always been first rate and the food while never great was at least passable. On our flight (EI-111) from Shannon to JFK we were served a meal that was quite possibly the worst we have ever been served on any airplane. We opted for the chicken ""dinner"" that came with some sort of rice as well as something called ""Spicy Salad"" if I recall correctly. The salad was inedible. If this is the type of food we can expect from Aer Lingus in the future I can assure you that we will be looking for a different carrier on our next trip.",False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,2,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2014-07-17,Have taken Aer Lingus from the US (Chicago and NY) several times and am very impressed. The planes are new the seats reasonably comfortable (good leg room and we are tall people) the food fine and good selections on the personal TV/Movie screens. No problems with being on time staff was friendly and efficient.

Aer Lingus customer review,6,2014-07-17,BRU-DUB. I am regular flyer on this route normally on 10.20am flights. What is going on with the re-instated check-in / bag drop queues at Brussels? I say re-instated because after online check-in finally came to BRU airport there have never been any issues with this flight in either checking in or dropping bag lines in Brussels. However last two times in June and this morning there were huge queues on both the Aer Lingus check-in line and bag drop/Gold circle line. And they both seem to advance eternally slow. Why does it seem to take so long per passenger to simply drop off a bag? I ended up getting fed up and bypassing altogether and brought my bag through security and got it checked at gate which is an added nuisance but one time I had skipped breakfast and really needed to get past security to eat something before collapsing. I am not sure what is causing the problem but there seems to be some ambiguity about the queuing lines for the check-in and bag drop / gold circle and people just seem to pass no heed of which is the correct line and join one or the other whichever is shorter. I think they need some better identification or barriers between the two to snake the queues to make it work better. Or a staff member guiding people correctly.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,3,,True,

Aer Lingus customer review,6,2014-07-06,Flew BRS-DUB-YYZ then YQG-YYZ-DUB-BRS in June 2014 as it was convenient to fly from our home airport rather than drive to London for a direct flight. Could not check in online as we had not booked directly with airline which meant an early start at the airport and no seats together. BRS-DUB with Stobart and a tiny noisy twin-prop as you might expect for such a short flight. DUB-YYZ plane looked brand new - think this route had only just started flying - and was full. 3-3 configuration felt very cramped. Drinks and food OK but not served until about 2 hours into the flight and no pre-landing snacks left by the time they got to us on the back row - we were offered a selection of biscuits instead. Service was fine apart from this. IFE selection limited and touchscreen system somewhat temperamental. Not a full-service airline so alcoholic drinks had to be paid for (we were prepared and brought euros just for this). On return YQG-YYZ sector by Air Canada - checked bags through to BRS for us. YYZ-DUB was a night flight but drinks and food again served after 2 hours water on board not working so no tea or coffee (or water in the toilets) lights not dimmed at all though a blanket and pillow were provided. Flight seemed to be on time leaving but arrived 30 mins late though no there was no mention of this or apology from the crew. It was only on the very long walk from the gate that we realised there'd been a delay and had to run then be fast- tracked through security just getting to the gate for our connecting flight as it closed behind us. Needless to say our bags didn't follow us for a couple of days. You get what you pay for and Aer Lingus were a little cheaper and a lot more convenient than other airlines for us. For a 7hr flight they were fine and I might be tempted by the convenience of the DUB US immigration pre-clearance to fly to NYC or Boston with them but I wouldn't travel any further.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,True,

Aer Lingus customer review,4,2014-07-06,"LHR-SNN 17th June 2014. I used to travel Aer Lingus on this route quite regularly however since experiencing the leg room on the A319 I see no reason now to chose Aer Lingus over Ryanair when travelling from London to Shannon. I am 6'1"" and I literally could not fit my legs in to the seat. Luckily I was in the aisle however kept having to squeeze my legs in when the trolley came past. I am aware these are former Iberia aircraft hence the reason for the difference between the leg room in the A320 and the A319 however I feel Aer Lingus should have reconfigured the A319 to provide a consistent product between aircraft. I travelled in row 7 on the outbound leg of this journey (which was the former business class area for Iberia) and had more than enough leg room. Beware of travelling in the rear of the aircraft on the A319. Very unpleasant flight and I just about managed to put up with it for the hour duration of this flight.

My husband is a retired Air Traffic Controller and said we were flying Aer Lingus or Icelandair only so we flew Aer Lingus. Loved it! The stewards were very nice and the crew were funny even in announcements. We did not upgrade the meal but they were great except on the way back I asked for the beef dish and she gave me the chicken which had curry and I can't eat curry.

Aer Lingus customer review,6,2014-06-25,BHX-DUB-JFK. We booked Aer Lingus because it was the most cost-effective option to New York from Birmingham with a short connection time. I was apprehensive above flying Aer Lingus based on previous reviews. The BHX-DUB sector was on an Aer Arran (now Stobart Air) ATR which was practically empty with overhead bins that accommodated carry- on's but the aircraft was very noisy. DUB-JFK was an A330 in 2-4-2 configuration. Seats and leg room were ok. Seat back TV entertainment was limited and not the most user friendly. Alcoholic beverages have to be paid for and there was only one round of soft drinks. The meal was mediocre and the pre-arrival snack was a flapjack. The crew constantly seemed in a hurry to distribute meals and drinks to the point where they practically chucked it at you before moving on. The crew then disappeared not to be seen until arrival. Whenever I fly transatlantic in economy I always seem to be disappointed. Nothing beats the middle eastern carriers on service. The only benefit of flying Aer Lingus is leaving from a local airport and the US pre-immigration clearance in Dublin which enables one to arrive in the US like a domestic passenger and avoid the lengthy immigration queues. Price however is comparable to other carriers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,3,,False,

We waited in line 55 minutes while one employee handled baggage and check in for the flight. While she assured us that we would make the flight it was a harrowing experience after we arrived at the airport 1 hour and 20 minutes early. At the gate one employee handled boarding and she had to check a number of bags because the overhead bins were inadequate for a typical carry on. We paid extra for upgraded meals which were terrible and I hate to think what those that did not upgrade had to eat.

The Dublin to Orlando journey was very uncomfortable the seats are far too narrow the leg room is a minus and the arm rests are far too narrow. All in all a horrible journey.

The entertainment screen can be pretty difficult to see if the shade is left up. EI should maybe roll out a business 'lite' for this route and throw free something or other into the mix but really it's quite a short flight so not hugely important but might be a nice touch. Bought a breakfast quite nice and filling. Crew the usual brand of EI pleasant. Usual happened on landing and has happened the last few times it's almost like someone has a peek out of a window and wonders what a plane is doing there as if it's a surprise. Waited an age to get on stand even though multiple were empty equally as long for a land bridge and then another 20 mins for luggage. Fine in the air but the ground needs work.

Business cabin has only 12 seats plenty of room for storage. I had no neighbour making feel well isolated for a quiet flight. Sleeping was comfortable although the not fully flat bed is a bit tricky to handle at first. Food was one of the best I had on the many airlines I've flown with.

I am in full support of the labor action by the crew but I will never recommend Aer Lingus to anyone. We were not seated together so we could not help each other with our bags and the crew could easily have rectified this at boarding. A six hour flight sitting eight rows apart!

The meal on the plane going over was excellent it was off their new sky menu. I got the steak it was lovely. It was first class dining in economy class. It was well worth the €17.50 because that included a glass of wine. I would recommend getting this. Unfortunately I couldn't get this meal on the way back sold out.

Aer Lingus customer review,9,2014-05-29,Travelled on the Aer Lingus Regional ATR DUB-BRS-DUB return on Sat morning 7th May. Excellent service overall. Flights departed on time arrived early. The return was on one of the new aircraft. The Aer Lingus lounge in T2 is excellent and well worth the short detour. Only point to note is that all the Regional flights take off from the one gate in Dublin T2. You proceed downstairs onto the same level as US pre clearance through gate 412. I almost missed the bus over to the morning flight only for the fact that a ground staff called out 'anyone else for Bristol'. The screen at the gate advised next flight was the BRS flight and the Glasgow was boarding first. So perhaps they need to look at that or advise that there is a short bus ride over to the aircraft. Otherwise well recommended Vs the competition and the fare was excellent value for a short flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,

They have recently had more new planes (ATR 72) prior to this the flights were invariably a few hours late. However they are now mostly less than one hour late.

Boarding on the outward and return was calm and civilised and the ATR aircraft clean and comfy enough for a short hop. Check-in staff and the crew onboard were polite and there was an adequate range of snacks and drinks for purchase onboard. Terminal 2 at Dublin was smart and stylish.

Aer Lingus customer review,4,2014-05-11,Flew Barcelona-Toronto via Dublin. First time on Aer Lingus and the biggest draw was the excellent fare. Having said that I won't recommend except for bargain hunters. BCN-Dublin is basically a low cost flight curiously more comfortable than the 757 they used for the transatlantic leg. This must be the narrowest twin-engine plane around very narrow seats (and I'm on the slim side) and little legroom on top of that. I heard many people commenting on the lack of space. The personal entertainment system is not bad although only a few recent releases plus some shows and documentaries and music and maps. Food on the outbound flight was awful and made me ill afterwards so I avoided it on the inbound and brought my own food. Drinks service is seriously cheap no free alcohol and just water orange juice or Coke/Sprite available. Crew was friendly but never followed up on the one occasion (each flight) I went to the galley to ask for something even though they said they'd bring it to my seat. Transfer at Dublin was easy but with a lot of walking. I won't fly this particular route with them again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,3,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,False,

Aer Lingus customer review,10,2014-05-08,I have travelled with various airlines out of Dublin in the past haven taken a break from Aer Lingus. However recently I flew with them to Munich and have to say I was very impressed overall with the service. I checked in on my mobile presented my boarding card on my mobile and had no problems using it getting through security. The aircraft was an A320 I was seated at row 12a which was an emergency exit so I had plenty of leg room on way out. Food was of good quality although I would have liked even a complimentary tea or coffee instead of 2.50 but only a small negative. On my return home the journey was a little more eventful which ended with me collapsing in the middle of the cabin. I can not commend the cabin crew enough for looking after me and administering the necessary first aid etc to ensure I was safe and comfortable.

Aer Lingus customer review,,2014-05-05,"The plane sat on the tarmac for an hour (flight attendants even went through the safety announcement) before the pilot announced a problem with an engine that had to be tested.

We were herded onto another plane and they took us yet again through the safety procedures. Then they proceeded to offer us tea and coffee for which they charged 2.5 euros. Because of the delay I missed my international flight by half an hour. Nevertheless the flight attendants insisted all those with connecting flights go to the terminals where their flights had already left. I spent 3.5 hrs trudging through Heathrow trying to get home. Finally after going through security 3 times in one day I arrived back at the Aer Lingus desk at terminal one.

Compared to Delta there were far fewer movies to choose from and they were not current titles. Expect ones you've already seen 5 years ago. The hot meal was the usual chicken or beef options and was nothing to write home about. The pre-landing snack was a flapjack. They give you a knife and fork to eat it bizarrely. I guess this airline just loves wasting money. The armrests between seats do not go all the way up to prevent passengers lying down on a row of four. Annoying if you want to catch a quick nap.

Unfathomable why arm rests do not totally lift up to increase possible passenger comfort! The chicken curry was frankly awful. Crew were more interested in socializing with each other than providing passenger service. There were times that the crew area sounded more like an Irish pub - loud and noisy! And then there is the fact that for all connecting Aer Lingus flights you must be re-screened for airline security!

Aer Lingus customer review,5,2014-04-21,"Dublin-CDG return this was on a flex fare so not really in business class as such as business class is non existent on short haul flights. While the service from the cabin crew was friendly and efficient I note several issues that management needs to address. Flex fare entitles you to access to airport lounges. This needs to be made stress free for passengers. This time I received the invitation by email but as I had changed the dates as I am entitled to do I used the original lounge invitation (as no new invitation came by e-mail). No problems encountered in Dublin but while in Paris the staff in the Icare lounge came back to me while I was sitting down and eating to verify that the original lounge invitation reference matched my flight reference. I don't blame her as she was very apologetic for having had to do so. Surely if this is an issue for ground staff Aer Lingus should send a new invitation when you change the dates. In some previous flights the invitation did not come at all and Aer Lingus did not reply to my queries and there were issues getting access to the lounge without this ""invitation"". Perhaps Aer Lingus does not really bother with this as most people don't really bother with paying the higher flex fares. However for those who pay they should get what they pay for without any stress. I would also suggest that if you pay this fare you should at least be entitled to one meal and one drink on your flight since the fare costs 3 to 4 times more the cheaper fares. I will continue to use Aer Lingus as I live in Ireland and I find their cabin crew generally friendly and efficient but I hope management takes note of my comments and suggestions.

We had to go through security all over again! Their phone lines go down at 9.45 ET which means when we call after missing the 8:05 flight to LA they're closed they put us on an infinite loop hold! Flight and airport wait time total was 14 hours! Now we're just stuck in Chicago and wouldn't have been if anyone would have put in any real effort in to get us home like putting us on the 9.25 flight that would have given us plenty of time to get to the terminal from international.

Aer Lingus customer review,10,2014-04-19,Our flight from Belfast to Malaga was cancelled on the 8/4/2014 reasons unknown and we were moved to the 9th. This was unsuitable so I called the customer services and without any hassle we were moved to a flight departing Dublin for the original date. When we checked in via the self check in machine our pre booked seats had changed and when mentioned to the desk staff they quickly corrected our seats back to the original with a sincere apology. The morning flight was on an A330 the advantage to this was we had IFE for the short 3 hour flight but it was a welcomed bonus. Crew were friendly and accommodating to any request and seemed to enjoyed serving the customers with a smile even when it was a full flight. This was a faultless flight in every respect arriving at destination bang on time.

Aer Lingus customer review,,2014-04-14,We travelled from Manchester to New York via Dublin. On the way out the TV's were not working they reset them several times and still didn't work. Food was very poor so advise taking a sandwich with you. Loads of free pretzels for some reason which were horrid. No choice of snack and a very small orange juice break. Coming back we had paid for an upgrade for our seats we were shocked to find ourselves in the middle row of the plane no where near our allocated seats. Complained to air hostess who said they had changed the plane so therefore had been downgraded. No compensation and certainly no refund. Eventually after 2 months complaining we got our upgrade money back no compensation for the stressful flight home though. Also on the way back the movies were constantly interrupted with news of Aer Lingus charity work and asking for money. I had no issues donating the rest of our dollars but would have done so without being asked 10 times.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,1,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,2,2014-03-28,"I've been to Ireland 6 times in the last 10 years and have always flown Aer Lingus. The first time was lovely then United Air got involved and things went completely down-hill. This last trip was horrid. I don't know how anyone could find the seating even close to comfortable. I weigh around 108 lbs and was traveling with my 145 lb brother the seat felt like concrete. Like one of the other reviews I have to sit on the pillow. These retro- fitted planes are the pits. The seat in front of me was 12 inches from my nose (the screen was basically in my face.) The arm rests don't fold all the way back so you have to be a circus contortionist to get out of your seat. Two people cannot pass one another even if they're going sideways. An older gentleman literally fell into what was luckily an empty seat trying to get back to his seat. The flight attendants were pleasant enough except for one male who thought he was ""large and in charge"". The food was the usual stuff basically it was edible. My brother needs a cane for walking and were with the other handicapped to get on the plane on the return flight. Unfortunately we ended waiting 20 minutes in the cold ramp thing (can't think of the right term) that leads to the plane while cargo was being loaded. That's right cargo not luggage. Yep the people who need canes and walkers were standing around for 20 minutes. As for the entertainment it didn't really matter since I can't look at a screen that's right in my face.",False,,,Economy Class,,,1,4,,,3,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,3,2014-03-18,"3/4/2014 flight to Dublin. 3 of our group were flying from LAX and one was flying from Denver. Both flights had less than 2 hours layover in Chicago. Since you have to change terminals and go through security again this layover is just unacceptable. The LAX group barely made the flight. It was almost fully boarded when we got to the gate and we did not dilly dally at all. The flight from Denver was 20 minutes late. Our friend and 5 other people ran from Terminal 1 to Terminal 5 and arrived at the gate at 5 minutes before takeoff time. All 6 passengers were denied boarding. They watched the plane pull away from the gate. The exasperating thing is that the Aer Lingus staff at the gate take no responsibility and show no empathy for this issue. It should be noted that we arrived in Dublin 1.5 hours early. So waiting 5 minutes to board those 6 passengers would not have impacted the arrival at all. Then to make it worse on our return flight they canceled my friends upgraded meal. Their logic was ""well you weren't on the flight to Dublin for your upgraded meal so we canceled your return meal"". I agree with the post about the seat arm rest not going up. Not because you can't spread out but because you cannot get out of your seat to go to the bathroom.

Aer Lingus customer review,7,2014-03-04,Round trip to New York (EI 105/104). Flight out on time and the food was pretty decent I had upgraded my meal choice. Pretty quiet flight not too busy and plenty of space to stretch out although the middle armrest not lifting up all the way is pretty annoying if you're trying to spread out a bit. Fantastic crew. Return flight was fine food not as good and again great crew. However why is this flight scheduled to leave at the time it does (5.30 pm) and then arrive into Dublin 5.5 hours later it's fast but when you land in Ireland it's still only 11 pm in NYC. If the flight is that short and apparently it regularly is then could it not be scheduled it to arrive in Ireland the same day as it leaves NYC. Also I think it was a surprise to ground crew that we got back so early as we had to wait 50 mins for bags to arrive.

Aer Lingus customer review,9,2014-02-14,Flew with Aer Lingus round trip Dublin-Gatwick this week. Very pleased with the service overall. The outbound flight on Tuesday was lightly booked and we got away early. Terminal 2 is very pleasant to use and even the security area was moving quickly. This was the first time I had used the pre-order meal service and it worked well in getting the breakfast before the main cabin service began. It is good value and I would estimate that about 10 of the 50 or so passengers had pre-ordered. Coming back was even easier at Gatwick airport and this was an almost full flight. The cabin crew were especially good. I ordered tea and the cheese board (could do with a little more cheese). Weather was bad coming into Dublin in the aftermath of the storms and I could tell we weren't going to be able to land from the approach and just before touchdown we went on a go around. The Captain came on and was very re-assuring and explained what had happened and again the cabin crew were very reassuring in making the extra safety announcements.

The only negative thing about the outbound flight was that there was a mother that did nothing but shout at her kids from the moment we took off until the moment we landed and when your flight is at 8.30 in the morning it's the last thing you want. Inbound flight DUB-CWL flight EI3298 31/10/13 - we left Dublin later than scheduled due to the fact there was a technical fault with a light in the cockpit and could not take off until it was solved. Within minutes engineers were onboard and both the captain and flight attendants kept us up to date with what was going on and reassuring us that everything was going well. The flight attendants on the inbound flight were much friendlier and talkative which is a great thing to have on an airline. Even though our flight departed late we landed just 5 minutes later than scheduled.

At Cardiff everybody stood around the baggage carousel and no bags. Rang Dublin to find out when bags would arrive and found no info. Told case was still in Dublin and as we were due home on Sunday 29th December to go to the baggage counter in arrivals.

Outbound my designer coat had to be bunched into a ball by a very abrupt FA and put up top for take off due to it not being secure. Inbound my neighbour had 3 shopping bags and a coat on the middle seat and not an eyelid batted? Food service is also always hit a miss outbound I was able to buy a breakfast offering on return nothing was available. Also I note the seat belt sign seems to stay on unusually longer than any other airline probably to keep passengers seated longer in order for service prep. Seats are comfortable for short haul leather but starting to wear slightly. Gold Circle club is a waste of time. At Dublin I attempted to check in at a computer terminal with my passport and told to report to a physical desk for check in. Oh joy huge queues luckily I tried another machine and it worked fine. The only reason I find a lot of people use IE is the route monopoly.

The crew are friendly but professional and the food and wine selections were of high end restaurant quality.

The seats we paid $50 extra were extra leg room (perfect) the seat itself for me (I have a 44"" waist was tight but tolerable). The food was very good (Lasagne) and the later sandwich (ham and cheese) was also very good and unexpected. Great flight. The return trip on 11/18/2013 Flight EI125 we thought OK now we'll see how it is in comparison. The Male Flight Attendant and also Senior Crew member was great as well.

The transatlantic flights are always pleasant clean aircraft with friendly staff. IFE is adequate with personal seat-back TVs. Only complaints are that the economy seats are pretty hard and uncomfortable - they're actually nicer on the short-haul flights. I usually have to sit on the pillow to be comfortable. Also the departure gate area at ORD is too small for the number of passengers on the flight - numerous passengers end up standing and sitting on the floor in the hallway.

Aer Lingus customer review,2,2013-11-25,We booked to fly from Dublin to Gatwick. Aer Lingus was the only airline flying this route on that day so I had booked them as opposed to BA. We had some extra baggage so I went ahead and booked an extra bag ahead of time for 15 Euro. When I got to the airport I was told that although I had booked and paid for an additional bag I was still only allowed the same baggage weight allowance for one person (20kg). I cannot understand why anyone would want to purchase an extra bag without wanting extra weight. I assumed I would be allowed 40kg when I booked the extra bag but I was still only allowed 20kg which would have been the same weight as if I had not booked the extra bag. I am sure that a lot of other passengers fall for this! In all fairness Aer Lingus is a good airline to fly light. They have very competitive prices if you travel light but it can cost you your shirt and pants literally if you are over weight. I almost had to pay 300 Euro in over weight fess.

Friday flight - delayed yet again due to Aer Lingus passengers taking their time to get on and off the plane. People again had too much hand luggage and the ground staff were forced to place some in the hold. Late take off due to passengers being selfish and hogging the overhead bins and generally being thoroughly stupid with regards to the basics such as sitting down quickly and being able to count from 1 to 29. The crew found it frustrating and its credit to them they kept calm during a very unnecessary delay. I'm finding this behaviour very annoying and am going back to Ryanair who at least make the effort to be on time and their passengers don't push and shove like Aer Lingus passengers.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,4,,,3,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,,2013-11-21,The service and food was adequate considering we got a good deal on round trip flights between SLC and Dublin. Rather it would have been a good deal if Aer Lingus didn't end up charging my $521 for two more tickets to return home. After getting a little lost in Dublin we arrived at the airport with a little over an hour before our departure time. When we tried to check in at the kiosk it said check-in was closed. The attendant directed us to the check-in desk. They told us check-in had closed 15 minutes ago. When I pointed out that there were no lines at security and that an hour would still be plenty of time to get to our flight they still refused to let me check in and sent me to another desk to find another flight. The frustrating thing was I presumably would have been allowed to check in on the kiosk if I had been there 15 minutes earlier but I still could have had to wait in line to check my bags. That was not the case. I was able to walk right up to the desk because the airport was not very busy. When I went to the customer service desk we still had 55 minutes before our departure. Told they could get us to the U.S. that night but we'd have to find our own connections but she was not willing to quote the price of those other options. As it turns out it looks like Aer Lingus sold our seats out from under us. Yes I suppose I should have arrived earlier but I've made long haul flights before with less time to spare.

Very friendly and ever present staff on the transatlantic portion. The seat turned into an almost lay flat bed which provided a sound sleep in both directions. Wines were well chosen and poured frequently. Meals were well presented with a variety of appetizers before and hot breads during dinner. The staff service and the overall cleanliness of the plane convinced me that I had made the right choice for an airline. The connection DUB-CDG was a packed economy flight. For an hour and a half flight it was tolerable. Aer Lingus competes with Ryanair on this route so everything including water is for sale. My choice from now on for transatlantic flights.

Very attentive to all passengers on a late night flight from New York to Dublin. Pilots again very informative on routing weather and arrival time which is great. Crew apologetic for delay leaving JFK but flight still arrived 55 mins ahead of schedule. Added bonus was the fact that the crew played some great modern music while taxiing to stand after arrival.

We booked their so called Choice seats for which we paid extra but there is no real advantage to this other than you get to board with business class. Aer Lingus offers the facility to pre-order better quality meals and I would definitely recommend doing this. Much better than the normal economy offer and you get free wine. The service on the flight out was exemplary. They had lost my wife's pre-booked meal but rustled her up a business class meal and gave us extra wine to compensate. Film choice is not nearly as good as we have experienced on Far East airlines and very annoyingly they truncated the film service towards the end of the flight to show a video for their pet charity which they had already screened at the start of the flight. Big bonus being able to clear US customs in Dublin so arrive at Chicago as domestic passengers. On the flight back they woke us up three hours after serving dinner for a cheese roll at 3.30am Suggest they abandon this idea and let people sleep a bit longer.

So return last night full flight (215 people). Departure at 9.20pm. At about 8.30 at gate announcement made asking everyone to go downstairs collect bags and exit for bus transfer to Cologne where our aircraft was! Turns out curfew at Dussledorf means no jet aircraft after 10pm. Inbound flight was delayed which would have prevented a departure prior to 10 resulting in an overnight. All handled pretty well to the point that obviously this was not the first time this happened! Bit of a pain back through security etc in Cologne and people who had bought duty free in Dussledorf had some issues. Ended up arriving in Dublin at 1am about 3 hrs late. Flight itself fine. My only comment is on one attendant. Few German lads in row opposite me having a few drinks. A bit spirited but nothing to bother anyone. In fact the young attendant on board had a few laughs with them chatting about best pubs to go to in Dublin. Then as other attendant passing they were a bit loud and I noticed her giving them a hard stare. I travel a lot and know when people are behaving in a poor manner but not in this case. She had a furious look the whole trip.

Aer Lingus customer review,5,2013-09-25,Flew Cork-Nice return recently. Outward flight was fine and on time. Food on flight was quite poor and bad value. Aer Lingus seemed to have changed caterers. Return flight was a shambles. All passengers were boarded on time and the pilot announced that all was ready with just some paperwork to complete which would take just a few minutes. Time passed slowly and the minutes mounted up. After about 15 minutes the pilot said that there was a slight problem and he was waiting for an engineer to sort things out. The engineers duly arrived and were to be seen examining so instruments in the cockpit. They left and returned a number of times and the cabin crew did their best to reassure the passengers and were unable to begin catering of any sort because of customs regulations. After about and hour a supervisor went to the cockpit and some more examining of instruments continued. The pilot said at this stage that there was a fuel gauge problem and after about another 15 mins he announced that the problem had been satisfactorily solved. So one and a half hours late we departed.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,,2013-09-24,"Travelled from Dublin to Nice in July. I was seated in front of the emergency rows. When the doors closed I asked a flight attendant if I could take a seat in one of the empty emergency seats. There were 3 consecutive seats empty. You would think that I had just stolen the crown jewels! The young flight attendant berated me with sarcasm ""you have to pay for them"" in her loudest Dublin accent. This is not the first time I've experienced this type of condescending attitude from an Aer Lingus flight attendant. Totally unnecessary.

Aer Lingus customer review,10,2013-09-24,MAN-SNN SNN-JFK JFK-DUB DUB-MAN. Got a great deal on the ticket price very comfortable A330 planes on the long haul segments with seat-back IFE with a great selection of movies and music very helpful and friendly crew and decent food/drink selection. All sectors were on time and transfers at SNN and DUB were fast and easy. In addition to the excellent all round service there are two major advantages to using Aer Lingus for transatlantic travel: Pre-clearance is available for all USA bound flights out of SNN and I believe selected flights out of DUB hence you arrive as a domestic passenger in the USA and walk straight out of the airport - the pre-clearance facilities in Shannon at least have virtually no queues and you can get through them in a matter of minutes so I suspect that even accounting for the layover time it is as quick as flying directly. Secondly Aer Lingus use T5 at JFK which is a marvellous Terminal loads of space seats eating and drinking options and really fast efficient (and surprisingly friendly) security - I believe that T5 is exception at JFK in this regard. All in all I would very highly recommend Aer Lingus for transatlantic travel to anyone.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,

Aer Lingus customer review,7,2013-09-22,Just completed a LHR to DUB round trip on flexi tickets which is the nearest you can get to Business class on Aer Lingus. Loved the lounges at both ends uncrowded and stylish. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Great in flight magazine. The new Terminal 2 at DUB is a delight. But the aircraft's are very cramped the flight out was completely full and I felt very trapped even being on the front row. The lack of proper inflight catering brings the on board service down combined with the cramped seat pitch and no free on board catering creates a no fills feel. Even if you pay and pre order a meal on a flexi ticket you lose it if you change your time. Surely modern IT could cope with re-assigning it.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,3,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2013-09-18,Dublin - Malaga return. Outbound on 05/09/13 on A330. All aspects of this flight was excellent. Flight on time seats were comfortable and staff excellent. Only gripe was delay in getting baggage in Malaga airport. Return on 17/09/13 on A320. Seats were a bit hard but ok for a 3 hour flight. Staff again friendly and helpful and flight on time.

Aer Lingus customer review,1,2013-09-10,I flew on a flight from Cork to Paris yesterday and to my horror I was scolded by ground staff that my baggage was overweight. I was shocked because I bought a more expensive ticket that allowed me to carry 2 bags. However in the fine print of Aer Lingus it states that whether you carry one or two bags the maximum weight allowable is 20kg. This makes absolutely no sense in having 2 bags of 10kg since the bag itself weights about 2kg to 3 kg so you lose out if you carry 2 bags. Your total weight allowance shrinks from 20kg to 17kg if you carry one bag and if you carry two bags it shrinks from 20kg to 14kg as the 2 bags will weigh 6kg in total. So I paid extra money for absolutely nothing. I thought that when you paid extra money you will be allowed to carry 2 bags of 20kg each (totalling to 40kg). This is the worse thing I found about Aer Lingus. I had to pay EUR75 for 5 kg overweight. Also this flight had no business class and I had taken the highest class available called Economy Class Flexi Fare. Even my Star Alliance Gold Card was not useful.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,

On boarding the aircraft at Boston Logan Airport for our flight we were greeted by a very welcoming flight crew. The aircraft was well maintained and very clean. As soon as we departed Boston beverage service was served. Complimentary soft drinks served but alcohol was not free which is ok. Dinner service began about 1 hour after departing and we were served chicken or beef. The meal service was delicious. Flight crew came around during dinner service with more beverages and water.

Aer Lingus customer review,10,2013-08-04,Having flown several times with Aer Lingus decided to upgrade to their Business Class cabin from Manchester to Chicago via Dublin. Flight transfer is very easy to navigate in Dublin and on this flight you actually pre-clear US customs in Dublin which is an added bonus. Business Class cabin extremely spacious on the A330 and you are warmly greeted with a nice amenity kit bottled water and champagne. Business Class dining is superb and well worth the upgrade cost in itself with a good choice of entrees. Service includes hot canapés salad and main cheese and biscuits together with a choice of desserts. You won't go hungry! Cabin crew are attentive and if you require extra refreshments you only have to ask. On return to Dublin you also get continental breakfast. Seats are comfortable and fully adjustable to how you want. There are extra buttons in the arm rest which allows you to individually control different parts of the seat including massage. IFE good although they seemed to have dimmed the brightness of the screen recently so you may need to close the window blind to watch.

Flight was on time and all went smooth with luggage etc. All members of staff were helpful and accommodating. Food was good for aeroplane standard and was reasonably priced for being on a plane.

The seats were comfortable but everything looked tired and not exactly pristine. IFE is nearly impossible to use as the touch-screens wouldn't respond to pressure. The meal was okay (biryani chicken) though the piece of meat was about as big as an eraser. The flight attendants (save for one very nice girl) were sulky and bored and made us all feel like we were cattle. As we left the plane the cabin attendant didn't even look up into our faces when she said goodbye.

Flight attendants could not have been more helpful and supportive especially as they are really busy on short flight. A320s were great and though it was a gusty crosswind day for landings never felt anything but safe and supported. One attendant even provided me with some extra reading material in case I needed it to help distract me and even bought me a drink from the trolley! Was not expecting such above and beyond service.

Just 2 hours although we didn't see much of the crew and surprised that the only refreshment available on board had to be purchased. Long haul legs were another story. Incredibly disorganized ""mob boarding"" in Boston. Flight crew on outbound leg were quite grumpy and unfriendly. I had pre-ordered a vegetarian special meal with an allergy requirement. They got the allergy but not the veg part and I was presented with a hunk of chicken which the flight attendant said she thought was ""Just a bit of tofu."" Offered cheese and crackers. Returning I had called to make sure I got a suitable dinner. Well they had one but I heard them give it to the woman behind me. I had to explain to her that she had my food and get it back. On the return flight a flight attendant came with a big bag of blankets tossed the bag into the corner ripped the bag open and said not one word to anyone. No hot drinks available in the first round of service. Dinner trays stayed around far too long. On the return leg the promised ""afternoon tea service"" was delayed and was basically thrown at us.

Aer Lingus were punctual as I have always found on this route and the staff were pleasant enough. A major complaint is the terrible leg room their Airbus 319's which they received from Iberia.

All flight attendants were cheerful and courteous. The only complaint is that at Dublin airport our boarding passes stated that the gate closed at 10.55 am even though our flight did not leave until 12.40 pm. I do not appreciate being given misleading information like that even if the airline is only doing it to get the slackers to show up on time. I say leave them a couple of times when they are late and they will learn to be on time and not cause the rest of us to show up at the gate only to sit for almost two more hours after already spending two hours going through security and customs!

We paid extra for row 1 which was worth every penny. The only downside was oversize bags in the cabin along with perhaps half of the plane breaking the one piece of hand baggage rule leading to no space in the overhead bins.

Aer Lingus customer review,8,2013-04-14,Flew on the Gatwick/Belfast route 4 times in 2 weeks. Saw today they've increased from 3 to 4 flights a day so I presume they're doing well. They are in direct competition now with FlyBe who used to have this route to themselves and competition can only be a good thing IMHO. AE flight times are very similar to BE although we left before them twice even though their departure time was first. I think that reflects the increased pressure Flybe have on their turnaround times. The service is better on AE even though you still have to pay for food and drink the planes are better (A319s) and were immaculate. Only had hand luggage so can't comment on airport check-in. I did mine using their phone app which worked perfectly. The only niggle is their charging to book seats in the first 5 rows I find it a bit money-grasping.

Aer Lingus customer review,8,2013-04-11,Flew DUB-LGW-DUB recently and everything went smoothly. Paid extra for front seats Row 3 on way out and row 1 on way back for quick exit and was worth it. Also less hassle and pressure than Ryanair on same route and times. Tickets were only marginally dearer and not enough to make me join the rush for a seat on FR.

Aer Lingus customer review,6,2013-04-01,Travelled to JFK from LGW via DUB return. Went out coach and came back Business. The equivalent BA flight (coach both ways) would have been an extra £600 for the dates I wanted. The other thing was the convenience of using LGW instead of the awful LHR T5. Had a very early and quiet departure from LGW. Boarding was nearly on time and quite smooth. The food on board was appalling. It seems that if you pre- order meals you get far better quality. Maybe that should be made clear on the booking website. I needed to take some medication towards the end of the flight and asked the crew for a glass of water. It was provided in a very flimsy plastic 'glass'. Return leg in Business was on the evening redeye. Check-in was fine. Lounge was ok. Once the flight was called and I went to gate we still had another 30 mins wait. Business class seats had a huge control panel but no documentation on how to operate them. Trial and error eventually got the seat flat. The food was poor for business class. The white wine and fizz were excellent but the Italian red with the steak was disgusting. Breakfast was poor for business class. I would have expected an attempt at a cooked breakfast.

Aer Lingus customer review,7,2013-02-28,I flew from Venice to Dublin on 24 Feb 2013. There was only one check-in agent for the entire flight. Venice Marco Polo airport is a nightmare to depart from as there are very few security desks and lots of flights. Queue for security was appalling and stretched out of the departure building! I stood in line for almost 2 hours and saw several flights between different groups of passengers from various countries. Small children and elderly people were very upset. As I stood in line my name was called for final boarding. I only just made it to the gate and saw that 3 other passengers were denied boarding. I was bussed out to the flight alone on a transfer bus. Flight was pretty full and departure delayed 45 mins - not the fault of Aer Lingus though. The seats were fine if cramped. Tea and a snack had to be paid for. The crew were very nice and worked hard. I am a QANTAS frequent flyer and opted for the Aer Lingus flight to gain some more points. I booked a Y class seat and yet have not been awarded any points at all by Qantas who blame Aer Lingus who in turn blame Qantas! The fare was not the cheapest as some rivals offered cheaper deals with a stop-over. I would use Aer Lingus again as I like their friendly staff. I feel that the check-in procedure at Venice needs to be examined and Aer Lingus ought to exert some pressure on the airport to improve the squalid experience in the airport.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,,,3,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2013-02-14,I flew from Berlin Schönefeld (SXF) to Dublin (DUB). The flight lasted only 2 hours. The cabin was ok it was clean. The seat comfort was ok but not excellent.

The inflight entertainment was ok but a bit boring.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2013-02-14,Recently flew Cork - Lanzarote return. Both flights were on time and the service was excellent. Cabin crew very good particularly on return flight. Cabins were clean and tidy and Aer Lingus seems to have tightened up on the practice of allowing oversize baggage into the cabin. I had booked well in advance so price was quite reasonable. My usual gripe is with Cork Airport arrivals where the air bridges remain redundant and passengers have to brave the elements and 3 flights of stairs to get inside the airport building.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2013-02-14,Business class #124 Chicago to Dublin very clean and new-feeling Airbus 330-300 fine staff very thoughtful and professional. The seat is very comfortable Recarro sport-type does not go fully flat but is very nice in all other conformations. Even though Aer Lingus doesn't match up with the fabulous seating/bedding of major liners they exceed the US carriers in other ways. We saved about $1500 versus those carriers and I felt it was a fine bargain. I'd fly them again for sure.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,6,2013-02-13,"Seat room in economy is tight on the return flight (7 hours 20 mins) our baggage was mistakenly brought to the cargo area instead of baggage claim.

After 1 hr 45 mins we were told what happened and that ""we at least know where the bags are"".

Aer Lingus customer review,,2013-01-31,Birmingham to Cork out 29th return 30th January. Flight took off on time but hit heavy winds on approach aborted landing and circled for approx 40 minutes before diverted to Shannon. Bussed to Cork. Return flight on 30th January very much the same. When approaching Birmingham told that aircraft was outside it landing limits with the weather. Aircraft circled for approx 1 hour over Birmingham tried to land and aborted then diverted to Luton. Again bussed back to Birmingham 4 hrs late. Why do they use this type of aircraft this time of year which is close or outside it operating limits. Surely pilots have accurate weather predictions.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2013-01-28,Boston to Dublin onboard an Airbus 330. A very warm welcome from the Irish crew members upon boarding the aircraft. Soon after takeoff we were served beverage service and then our main dinner course of which was up to high standards. The main course consisted of chicken or beef. A very tasty meal. The crew members were all welcoming and served the passengers with full courtesy and friendliness. I have to say the crew always work hard on these flights and are a pleasure to have on board. I definitely will be flying with them in the near future.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2013-01-28,Flight was cancelled recently from Shannon to Manchester 25.1.13.

Aer Lingus customer review,9,2013-01-22,Dublin - Lanzarote 20 Dec return 03 Jan. I have travelled a lot with Aer Lingus and it seems they have moved away from the very low cost type of airline back to what they were. Was seated in row 2D adequate space (I'm 6ft 1). Crew very good as always and its nice to see the mature crew menders on board. I do have one gripe - Aer Lingus have a fantastic Deli/Pay Menu its a pity they never have any of the stock this is my 8th time since July with Aer Lingus where the stocks run out by the time the trolley hits row 2. I complained to the senior cabin crew member - she said agreed - that its always happening to them. Would still use them again no problem.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2013-01-22,Did my usual Christmas route LHR-SNN-LHR.

Aer Lingus customer review,8,2013-01-08,Flying from a regional airport in Germany to Dublin at Christmas time over the past few years I have usually tended to use Lufthansa usually transiting via Frankfurt. However in 2012 I chose instead to connect via London Gatwick on the outbound and London Heathrow on the inbound UK parts of the journey. Boarding the flight for Dublin at London Gatwick I was struck by the friendly Irish humour when asked by the flight attendant whether the wrapped Christmas present in my open carry-on bag was for her! That set the tone for the flight and indeed the Christmas season! It just shows how much a friendly crew can add or detract from the flight experience. Aer Lingus offered a professional and friendly service throughout with surprisingly comfortable seats. Did not purchase any inflight catering or make any other purchases given the very short duration of the journey. T2 at Dublin was impressive and although there was a mishap with my luggage on arrival the matter was sorted efficiently and to my satisfaction. I will be using Aer Lingus again in a few months time and looking forward to it.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2013-01-08,Flew JFK to Dublin on December 26 2012. Check in was fast boarding was smooth and the flight was pleasant to Dublin. Flew back January 6 2013 Dublin to JFK. Check in immigration and customs pre- clearance boarding were all smooth. The only issue and this is most likely not an Aer Lingus issue was the ridiculous walk from the plane to pick up baggage. Perhaps this was due to ongoing construction at the terminal. If not I feel for anyone that has trouble walking.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2013-01-08,Dublin - JFK on Dec 17 2012. The cabin crew were warm and helpful.

Aer Lingus customer review,9,2013-01-07,LHR-SNN return over the New Year period. Two excellent flights both leaving and arriving early.

Aer Lingus customer review,,2013-01-07,Was scheduled to connect at London Heathrow to an Aer Lingus flight to Dublin. American Airlines flight from the US was late and missed connecting flight.

Aer Lingus customer review,10,2013-01-04,Flew JFK to DUB return in J for the holidays. Check in at JFK is quick and easy and the oasis lounge is comfortable well stocked and quiet. What sets Aer Lingus apart is the friendly crew and to warm genuine Irish welcome on boarding . Although it was a full overnight flight the crew provided excellent service with generous drinks top ups and above average J food. The almost flat bed is reasonably comfortable for the length of flight. I only managed an hours sleep as its a short hop over the pond. Nice continental breakfast towels and proper tea before landing. Bags off first and overall excellent value. Return leg on the 105 on New Years Eve was excellent. Friendly J check in with no wait new T2 lounge quiet and the benefits of pre-flight clearance in Dublin are immeasurable. Again great crew generous drinks good food and warm smiles.,False,,,Business Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2013-01-02,SEN-DUB-SEN: First time travelling with this airline and have to say very impressed. Booking check-in all very straight forward only problem is had to queue along with other passengers at Southend Airport as no separate bag drop for online check in pax. Flight on time and first time in ATR42 aircraft. Very comfortable seating even with bags under seat in front of you. Allocated seating and not being treated like cattle is a big thumbs up from me. With this airline and Southend airport it has bought my faith back in commercial aviation. Would definitely use Air Lingus Regional again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,

Staff did not disappear into galleys during either daytime or night time legs. IFE is very good with a good choice of up to date movies. There was a problem with this on the return and they only managed to get the outbound movies shown. The lie-almost-flat seat was very comfortable and enabled me to sleep for a couple of hours.

Cabin crew are professional and friendly. Aircraft Airbus A320 was 5 years old and was very clean and tidy. Fare was good 120 euro return cheaper by 30 than Ryanair however they are far superior to fly with and are very lenient with bag weight.

A330-200 was clean the seats were comfortable the inflight entertainment system was excellent the food acceptable and the cabin crew attentive. We paid the extra $100US round-trip per person for bulkhead/emergency row seating. It was well worth it. Row 11 A/C has excellent legroom. A draw back is that the entertainment monitor is between the seat and has to fold up as there is no seat in front of you.

Aer Lingus customer review,10,2012-11-22,Glasgow to Orlando via Dublin. Excellent service for the second time this year.

Seating very cramped more than other ATR 72's I have flown bearable for one hour. The first and second rows have facing seats which were occupied by 2 drunk women. They managed to buy a round of drinks from the drinks trolley and continue their celebrations. The landing was smooth and on time we turned off the runway quickly to reach the stand.

Every time I have used this route it is delayed and speaking with other passengers I am not alone! The aircraft is always dirty - coffee spills down the seats/walls seem to be a permanent fixture and added to that the dirty magazines and paper wrappings left behind in the seat pockets. If I had a choice I certainly would not recommend this route to anyone.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,4,,,3,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2012-11-12,Milan - Dublin - New York and back. All the flights were on time at departures and arrived at destination before scheduled.

The only flight they could re-schedule us for was on 8th Nov and the only customer service they offered was a card with a telephone number.

While it was a last minute booking I'm afraid the service offered for the £570 I paid for the return ticket was abysmal! Only a short 1hr flight but nothing in the way of service not even a glass of water without having to pay for it. The saving grace was because I bought a full fare Y ticket I was allowed to use the lounge both at Heathrow and Dublin which where ok.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,,,2,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,,2012-11-01,We flew yesterday from Geneva to Dublin. The plane was two hours late; overhead luggage racks were full when we boarded and there were hefty charges for any food or drink aboard the flight.

There were no charges (yet) to use the toilets.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,,,2,,False,

Aer Lingus customer review,1,2012-10-25,EI 638 to Brussels. Fly Aer Lingus about 2 times a month for both business and pleasure. Unfortunately not much pleasure flying with Aer Lingus and getting worse. At the gate there was a team of 5 identifying bags take off passengers and put in the hold. Despite my bag being within guidelines (I have measured it) it was confiscated. I was first told that it was too big when I challenged this I was told that it was a health safety risk and would not fit in the bin. Strange as the same bag has been on about 20 flights with EI. It was rude and humiliating treatment by the staff but based on many reviews here it is a common theme. When I got to my seat there was plenty of space in the bin. Arrived late into Brussels and then had a 40 minute wait for my hand luggage. People will be more forthcoming with bags if they are given back to passengers as they get off the plane - Air France and US carriers have no problems doing this If someone has a problem maybe it is because they have documents laptops etc which they would prefer not to go into the hold for obvious reasons. At this stage I will use Aer Lingus when I have to but if there is any reasonable alternative then I won't and certainly not for leisure flights. As an aside the cost of the flight was in excess of €500.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,False,

No delay on first flight half-hour delay on second but reduced to 20 minutes on arrival. Hand luggage was slightly (about 1 inch) too broad but was never measured or weighed and therefore it wasn't a problem. Both flights about three quarters filled - all single travelers myself included got either a window or aisle seat with the middle seat left clear. Friendly staff and clean planes. On short haul flights no television screens with flight information. Available food on plane very limited. Inflight magazine one of the most boring I've read so far.

We were greeted at check in by the advice that wife's bag was 3 kg over and even though we had only one carry on bag well below 7kg no leeway was allowed. Aer Lingus is the only airline we experienced in 15 international flights that has a 20kg (not 23kg) hold baggage limit. To determine whether or not they are value for money I now routinely add $50 (that's what 3kg cost me) to their fares when I compare them.

My knees were jammed into the seat back in front of me and I couldn't get comfortable. 3 hours of that discomfort and I was ready to scream. I checked the website to see how to complain and I have to do it in writing - no email address is provided. How very convenient (for them not a complainant) Add to that the fact that my first two drink choices (none too demanding - a can of Fanta and then a can of Diet Coke ) were sold out and I'm less than impressed.

Aer Lingus customer review,9,2012-09-23,Flight from DUB-LHR to catch a connecting flight on another airline. Aircraft was clean and comfortable FAs polite and helpful. Flight on time. Only drawback was deplaning at LHR - passengers who were not connecting to another flight exited the aircraft first from the main door onto a jet bridge. Passengers with connecting flights exited last through the rear door down stairs and met a waiting bus. It seemed backwards to make passengers who might have tight connections wait until last to exit. Also since passengers were trying to exit from both the front and rear of the aircraft single-aisle aircraft it was difficult and time consuming for everyone to leave their seat collect their carry on and make their way to the exits. Perhaps this is a restriction coming from the airport rather than Aer Lingus but it seems like something that could be improved.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,1,2012-09-17,We flew from Bournemouth to Dublin. At check in we were told that our bags were too big to go on as hand luggage in spite of the fact that they are the same bags we have always used. We were charged £24 each. This was happening to everyone. Two passengers travelling separately both objected as they had travelled from Dublin to Bournemouth only a couple of days earlier with the same bags as hand luggage. It seems if we had made a scene we would not have been charged $8. Also another passenger on the same flight had a case that would fit under his seat and the steward had to remove it and put it at the back of the plane he was not charged for his bag either. On returning from Dublin to Bournemouth we checked in our bags thinking we had no option other than to pay (there are signs around saying pay up or leave your bags behind) and the check in girl said 'you do not need to check these in they are hand luggage.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,1,,,1,,False,

Aer Lingus customer review,5,2012-08-29,Just returned home from Lanzarote to Belfast on Saturday 25th August and was shocked about the level of customer care given. The senior cabin crew member on the flight was only interested in selling and was continually annoying passengers on the PA and being in the cabin selling things. Whilst I appreciate the airline and crew make money from revenue I have never seen such a cheap and nasty service offered and something I've never seen or expected of Aer Lingus. It was the most uncomfortable flight I've been on as the lights were on bright the entire flight home. Other passengers were complaining but the crew were more interested in selling than making it comfortable for passengers. On a positive note the crew out on Saturday 18th were very good and the crew coming home could learn a thing or two from them! Everything else about the trip was smooth but the journey home just completely spoilt it hence the low scores.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,2,,,4,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2012-08-29,Flew MAN-DUB-BOS-DUB-MAN. Cannot speak too highly of transatlantic sectors. Good time keeping clean cabin for today's airlines reasonable food. IFE was adequate for flight duration. Seat was comfortable enough again for the trip duration. What made Aer Lingus stand out on both transatlantic sectors was the service and efficiency of the cabin crew. My only gripe is the connection in Dublin where all of a sudden from being in a business class environment one has to jostle with other passengers. Perhaps they could look at having a dedicated point such as Swiss do in ZRH. Also the security point staff seemed overwhelmed with the scanner operator having to open bags too. I hasten to suggest that over worked staff can lead to lapses!,False,,,Business Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,2,2012-08-28,Booked a flight from DUB to YYC 8 months in advance. While I was on vacation Aer Lingus emailed me 6 times to notify me that our connection from ORD to YYC was cancelled but they failed to provide any assistance to get us home. I called their customer service line who offered me a similar flight on a different day but were unable to accommodate our schedule. I asked for a refund for the ORD to YYC portion of the flight which they agreed to but the agent was not able to tell me how much that refund would be. I had to rebook ORD to YYC on my own with a different airline. I will never use Aer Lingus again and I don't recommend it to anyone. Very poor customer service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,1,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2012-08-09,Our flight was great and the service wonderful. Staff polite and welcoming and the food good. We had first run movies TV shows games.

Aer Lingus customer review,10,2012-08-08,I've flown Aer Lingus twice a round trip from Helsinki to Dublin and another round trip from Dublin to Bologna. All flights were on time A320 nice and clean with leather seats that have head rests. Flight attendants have always been friendly providing excellent service. Check-in at the airport and getting an assigned seat is particularly nice and makes standing in line for boarding unnecessary. Great value for money and I fly with them on every opportunity.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,2,2012-08-02,Flown them on several occasions and every time there seems to be some sort of problem. The most recent - I was flying to Dublin (with Iberia and British Airways) from Central America via Madrid and London. My flight from Madrid to London (on BA) was delayed so I went to Iberia and said I had to get another flight from London. They immediately changed my flight and put me on the earliest flight possible so that I could make my flight free of charge. I arrived in London and made my way as quick as I could to Aer Lingus. I was too late for my bags to go through but there was one more flight. I could change onto that flight for €78. I booked an overpriced €250 round trip from Dublin to London and then missed a flight due to another delayed flight and they wanted to charge me more to take an empty seat on the next flight! The staff member in London was rude with an uncaring attitude. No level of hospitality and kindness. Flight itself was fine - no frills not much better than Ryanair not much worse.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,1,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,1,2012-07-31,Tuesday 24th July from Manchester - Waterford. Checked in on time for a departure at 13.15 this actually took off at 16.30 for Cork! If somebody had explained that the plane was being diverted to Cork and we were then being bussed back to Waterford we would have made alternative arrangements. When we were given our £3 lunch voucher we were told that our flight was in Cork. No mention that our flight was being diverted to Cork as well. When we arrived at Cork there was nobody to guide us to the baggage it was not labelled we eventually found the bus! At no time were we told what was happening total lack of communication.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,,,1,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,3,2012-07-25,"Recently traveled for family vacation from JFK-DUB-NAP. Our original flights to Italy experienced minor delays but our return trip from Naples Italy was horrendous. We were delayed multiple times with no explanation. No Aer Lingus employee ever came to the Gate to explain what was going on. We were not offered the opportunity to fly on another airline and by the time we departed we missed our connection in Dublin and were forced to stay overnight in Dublin causing me to miss a critical business meeting. Additionally staff in Dublin ""accidentally"" booked us on flights (through London Heathrow) with another overnight layover. I did not discover this until we were in out hotel room in Dublin purely by accident because we were not issued tickets just handed a computer printout and told we were on flights to JFK in the morning. That night after discovering the error I found a United flight direct to Newark NJ and asked to be booked on that instead which I was ""allowed"" to do. This was the first time I encountered someone helpful at Aer Lingus. Now rebooked on a direct flight the next morning to Newark NJ at my request.

Aer Lingus customer review,9,2012-07-25,BRS-DUB-BOS. We flew from Bristol to Boston connecting in Dublin. The regional flight was on time with quite poor legroom but we arrived early in Dublin. We changed terminal on one of the buses. The 11am flight from Dublin to Boston doesn't clear immigration in Dublin but it was no big deal. Non-alcoholic drinks were complimentary but things you had to pay for were obviously overpriced. The crew were pleasant and the entertainment was fine.

Aer Lingus customer review,5,2012-07-22,We had a terrible experience with how our cancelled flight was handled and the subsequent customer service after the flight on June 22nd out of New York (JFK) to Shannon. After returned to JFK due to problems with the plane's mechanics we were on the tarmac for 3.5 hours and then it took another 3 hours before we arrived at a hotel to spend the night. The next day we returned to the airport and there were only 2 ticket agents to re-ticket almost 400 passengers. We were given vouchers to use on the plane which we could not use once we got on the plane! We missed our reservation in Shannon and Aer Lingus would not refund this amount. The customer service at the New York Office was just an ineffective as the services we received in the airport.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,2,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,2,2012-07-19,Flight from Dublin to Heathrow to get connecting flight with Air New Zealand to LAX. Flight delayed followed by chaotic approach in prioritising passengers meant we missed our connection by 5 minutes. This would have been avoidable if cabin crew had adhered to its policy of getting connecting flight passengers off first via rear door. Instead we were the last to leave as front door took priority. Very disappointing.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,2,,,3,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2012-07-16,Flights LHR-DUB return. Check in at LHR got us an earlier flight aircraft clean and seating very comfortable.

Aer Lingus customer review,5,2012-07-09,We have today flown back from Cork airport on flight EI3701 to Birmingham. There were four of us so I pre-booked seats on Row 3 to ensure that we sat together. Unfortunately the legroom in these seats was much narrower than the rest of the seats. The two male passengers were 6ft 4in and 6ft 2in so you can imagine the uncomfortable journey they had to endure. It would have been preferable not to book seats in advance and take pot luck!,False,,,Business Class,,,1,4,,,1,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2012-07-08,I flew from Shannon to Boston yesterday 7 July and must say that I was both shocked and horrified that three of the female cabin crew including the cabin manager were chewing gum whilst serving food etc. I expect that here by the staff on US carriers but not Aer Lingus.

Aer Lingus customer review,7,2012-07-02,Most recently SXF-DUB-SXF return. The economy class product its getting better after dipping for a few years. Most of the A320s now seem to have the more comfortable seats with moveable headrests and a little more legroom than before (29 rows now instead of 30 I think). I'm an occasional flyer on this airline maybe half a dozen times a year mostly Spain-Ireland or Germany-Ireland. The staff are still pleasant if less experienced. It's a significant notch above Ryanair in overall product and service and worth a premium (often there is none). Pricing overall is competitive.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,2,2012-06-24,Shocking late service which the airline knew was running late but instead decided to leave everyone at Gatwick staring at the departure board for half an hour with the - please wait sign on. Unloading and loading of passengers was painfully slow (some passengers haven't yet grasped the need to read the ticket and establish what seat they are in). This is the second time this flight has been delayed and the excuses are somewhat similar. It might be an idea to cut the number of flights if they cannot keep the ones to London Gatwick on time. Very Poor prefer Ryanair. The 15/6/2012 Gatwick to Dublin.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,2,,,2,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2012-06-17,LHR-DUB flight was very well done by all accounts quiet and well maintained. The staff seemed very courteous and keen to engage in small-talk with customers. DUB-LHR flight not brilliant more down to bad luck than anything else on this flight it was more the people I was with that caused aggravation behind me shaking my seat back and forth as if it was a play-thing.

At Dublin the transfer was pretty smooth took approx 30 mins to pre-clear US Customs and Immigration. You don't collect and recheck your bag it's checked through and you are shown a picture of it on the belt to confirm it's yours etc. Boarded A330-300 clean tidy good AVO generally a nice plane to be on. Sat in the 2 row mini-cabin at the front quietest flight I've been on. Recaro seat is fairly decent. Food was perfectly edible and the crew were helpful and friendly. Arrived early into JFK bags came within a few mins. Return flight much the same exact plane and seat. 30 mins late boarding but made up most of it - arrived 5 mins late. Transfer was much easier and quicker A330-A320 in 30 mins left ahead of schedule arrived early to BHX and was quickly out of the airport.

I did ask for the same seat I had on the outward journey if it was available. I was told it was not and handed the boarding card within 10 seconds.

Aer Lingus customer review,8,2012-05-27,GLA-DUB-GLA. Very reasonable flights but we did not check-in any bags. Check-in with iPad was simple and straightforward and we breezed through security in both directions. ATR-72 plane was ideal for this short flight. The propellers are a lot louder than a jet plane but the 2x2 seat layout is much more suitable for most travellers than the usual 3x3 you expect on sort haul flights. The planes were comfortable and well maintained and the service both ways was professional and friendly. Overall a perfectly acceptable for the short route with an excellent frequency to Glasgow. Much better value for money than the competition (Ryanair from PIK which is invariably more expensive and less frequent). My only real complaint is the need to bus passengers out to a very remote stand in Dublin.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,

I had prepaid for my seat selection but due to aircraft change DUB-JFK I was moved to back of plane. I complained to attendant at gate in DUB who apologised and offered to put me in a window exit seat as there were no other aisles available. I preferred the aisle and so stayed with it which turned out to be fine. FA's are for the most part very friendly except for a couple on the return who were efficient but not really friendly. The best thing is being able to go through customs for the US in Dublin on the way out. No lines and easy to get through.

Passengers seated in the back where allowed to take big hand luggage with them. Those in the front were not so felt sorry for those who paid even more than for a standard seat as they either had their bags checked in for pick up or had to store it at the back of the plane.

Aer Lingus customer review,5,2012-01-25,BRU to DUB. As a regular flyer with Aer Lingus (Gold Circle Prestige) it is with regret that despite improvements in some areas (e.g. improved lounge) Aer Lingus has difficulty differentiating itself with its competitor Ryanair and passengers are not always the highest priority. Despite a stated policy allowing a cabin case and a personal item such as a laptop bag Aer Lingus has not communicated this to ground crew which led to a poor experience. It is not acceptable for a passenger to be castigated for exceeding the luggage limit when in fact this is not the case. It is also standard practice with other airlines that bags taken from passengers due to lack of space can be collected at the door of the plane rather than at the baggage belt - this is crucial when transfers are involved. Another recent trend is that the seat belt sign is left on until service is completed - a benefit for crew and cabin service rather than passenger comfort. Aside from these issues the flight crews have been generally pleasant on recent trips and 7 out of my last ten flights have been on time although thankfully I had built in enough time to make transfer flights.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,1,,,2,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,5,2012-01-11,Use Aer Lingus for European flights about 5 times a year. We have found that over the last year or two their planes are filthy the seats food-trays and seat-pockets are sticky and dirty every time we travel. We have always used Aer Lingus when possible and have found the service pricing and onboard staff to be excellent but the poor cleanliness is really letting them down.

Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-12-14,Several day return flights DUB-LHR and DUB-MAN. Quite expensive in most cases as booked quite late but were either not much more expensive than Ryanair or less when you factor in that you would have to pay for priority boarding with Ryanair whereas can book a seat for free on Aer Lingus. But there's no comparison between the two. Very good experience and T2 at Dublin is a fantastic improvement on T1. AL have just launched a new Sky Cafe menu that looks tempting and very well presented although it is a bit misleading to be presenting the full Irish breakfast on bone china when it actually comes in a silver foil tray! Cabin crew without exception very professional and friendly although when I was standing at the back of the cabin waiting to disembark at Manchester it was a bit sad to hear two of them complaining about their jobs. It's not the same as it used to be. But given the choice I would choose AL over any of their competitors out of Dublin.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-12-13,BHX-DUB return. I have flown this route with Ryanair and although it is marginally cheaper (£5 or so) Aer Lingus is worth it. Much more comfortable cabin and seats friendly staff and excellent service. Arrived to destination early.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-12-09,DUB-MCO. Assisted to the whole family in getting seats at the front of economy class. Dublin is a very clean airport to fly through but I went with Aer Lingus before the big move to terminal 2. Terminal 1 is still very nice. During the flight the cabin crew were nice and food was lovely. All together a lovely flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,5,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-11-29,DUB-ALC. Flew on an A320 both ways. Very high density and seats tight. Delay of 30 mins both ways. Very friendly staff and actually made you feel that you were important to them as a person not a customer. Food was lovely and landing was extremely smooth as usual.,False,,,Economy Class,,,2,5,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,2,2011-11-22,ORD-Dublin return. Very disappointing experience. On the way to Dublin the flight was nowhere near full but when asked if we could book seats together it was deemed an inconvenience. The flight attendants are not attentive and are inconvenienced if you ask to be served anything other than tea or coffee. The gate personnel on this airline were unwilling to make any accommodations. On the return gate check-in personnel were awful. They were unnecessarily stern and would not bend to make a single accommodation.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,2,"<span class=""star fill"">5</span>",,3,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-11-21,Dub to Madrid. Late departure due to passengers trying to take over sized bags onboard. Gate crew did a professional job of trying to take bags from people who should have known better. An almost full flight handled professionally by a competent crew. Nice Hot Irish Breakfast from the Buy on Board menu and regular updates from Captain during the trip. A great mid way service in terms of getting what you pay for with the care from the crew equivalent to that of any full service airline.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-11-07,DUB-LIN and BLQ-DUB. M Wickham's comments re: Venice are interesting. I had the same experience flying back from Bologna where the captain made reference to problems on the ground. Took an age to get people to the gate and onto the buses to the plane. No reason for it. Just typical Italian laid back attitude. Still made up time on the way back and only ended up 5 mins late. Both flights were fine on time clean aircraft and friendly FA's.,False,,,Economy Class,,,5,5,,,5,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-11-03,DUB-VCE-DUB. Outward flight punctual but return over 1 hr late departing. The pilot said that the reason for the delay was a 'long story' and that he didn't want to go into blame mode whilst heavily hinting at service agent problems in Venice. Pilots informative during the flights and cabin crew helpful.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,5,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-11-02,DUB-BCN-DUB. Flights on time crew professional and courteous seat pitch good. Dublin departure from Terminal 1 which was a 10 min walk from security at T2 and the flight to DUB left BCN from the far end of the terminal there - so another 10min or so walk.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,,,5,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-11-01,JFK-DUB-MAN return. Staff were friendly and helpful. Flights on time or early. Food typical airline quality but edible. I ordered vegetarian special which were delivered. A330-300 clean and adequate space and comfortable seat. The movies offered adequate variety. Only downside I was told that I needed to be at MAN 3.5hrs before departure. I called both the airline and the airport and was assured that this was necessary and check-in would be open at this early hour. So I was not thrilled to arrive at the airport to have to wait for 1hr before the desk opened. US Customs clearance and transiting in Dublin was easy but a lot of walking involved. I would highly recommend Aer Lingus. My fare was $500 cheaper than the best competitor on the same dates.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-10-26,JFK-DUB-LGW return Y Class. Purchased emergency exit seats for transatlantic sectors. Seats comfortable with extra legroom and FA on JFK-DUB supplied additional blankets. Food simple but adequate service charming and caring. Three hour delay at JFK so missed connection to LGW impressed with EI's handling and were rebooked on next flights while in the air new boarding cards with breakfast vouchers awaiting our arrival at DUB.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,5,,,5,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,5,2011-10-26,Glasgow-JFK via Dublin. All flights on time and clearing US customs and border protection in Dublin was an unexpected bonus. The seats and inflight entertainment was above average. However the bar service was only offered once during a 7.5 hour flight. I asked the stewardess if the drinks trolley would be making another appearance or if I could purchase a beer and she told me I could just have tea or coffee.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,2,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,5,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-10-20,ORD-DUB-CDG A330 ORD-DUB A320 DUB-CDG. Aircraft clean and bright. Transfer at DUB smooth and easy. FA's ORD-DUB were curt but efficient. Food acceptable but not as good as other European carriers. ORD-DUB we were served a small snack (pretzels) dinner and a croissant sandwich. There is only one beverage plus coffee/tea service on international flights and alcohol must be purchased. DUB-CDG there is no complimentary beverage or meal/snack service (all may be purchased). DUB-ORD also went well - FA's much more attentive and friendly. Beware that Aer Lingus has lower baggage-weight allowance than most carriers - only 23kg for long-haul flights. I ordered vegetarian meals (ON AerLingus.com) but FA's on the first flight said that they had no record of this request. I reminded the gate agent on the last leg of my trip but I was again told that there was no record of my request on the return trip.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,1,2011-10-12,Just spent half a day booking a simple flight from Cardiff to Dublin. The on line booking seemed simple until I tried to add and pay the £24 extra for a checked piece of luggage. What a joke and a waste of my time. The call centre operator eventually sorted my problem out but I have been left with a very negative view of 'Cheepo' airlines. The system is misleading since I did not realise there was extra to pay until after the booking was made. All pretty rubbish really. Let's hope the flight is not as poor.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-10-12,BFS-LHR-BFS A320. Fully boarded 20 mins before departure on return leg so efficient turn around. Crew friendly and pretty decent service on both legs. Both legs busy - 19.20 from LHR full on return leg. Looks like EI are doing well on this route but have still reduced to 3 flights a day for winter.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-10-09,LHR-BFS-LHR A320 with decent legroom. Friendly crews. For return leg the inbound flight was delayed 15 minutes (Heathrow and weather). However a very quick turnaround and boarding by front and rear steps rather than the usual seat row number system.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-10-02,GLA-DUB-ORL return. Service was great and I really liked the seats. Food was good and for the price an excellent service. Would use again. A word of caution Dublin airport is very confusing. The US pre-clearance is excellent but you cannot return to the lounge and we didn't appreciate this.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-10-02,Travel Dublin to London every week. The aircraft's are comfortable the food choice good and the cabin crew professional and friendly. Gold circle lounges are well stocked. The only complaint I would have is if you are on a flight after 18.00 out of Dub there is normally a member of staff mopping the floor something I feel should be saved for after the lounge is closed.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-09-30,LGW-Malaga return Economy. Booked online so downloaded my boarding pass 24 hours before flight which with only hand luggage made things simple and fast at Gatwick. Plane was A320 clean tidy and staff were friendly and helpful. Onboard food and drinks were quite expensive seats surprisingly wide and comfortable flight took off and landed on time. Return flight was hampered by not being able to download my boarding pass so no fast track  I had to queue at Malaga for over 1 hr and the flight was delayed for 30 mins but because of tailwinds we arrived at Gatwick 10 mins early.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-09-24,MAN to DUB then onto Boston return in Economy. A330/A320 both on time. Cabin Crew friendly and efficient. Food onboard was ok. Seat back TV's a bonus. The legroom was comfortable for a 6 hr flight.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-09-15,BOS-DUB and DUB-AMS. Flew A330/A320. Found the flights professional. FA fairly friendly and attended to needs. Had one get me warm milk for my baby whilst another did not return with an ice cup. Meals okay on first flight need to pay for the second. Baggage free for one luggage second flight was part of KLM codeshare and also free. Planes clean and arrived on time. A330 arm rests did not recline fully so difficult to lie flat.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-09-14,Amsterdam-Dublin and Malaga-London Gatwick. Staff have been professional and polite although I noticed some of the staff do not have English as their first language and could try harder to communicate more efficiently. One all of the flights I took departure was roughly on time and although in the budget category of airline Aer Lingus offers a good alternative to the more expensive carriers. I do not like the policy of charging for bags and found the website rather unfriendly - the latter is my only real concern. The new terminal in Dublin is very welcoming too. As a non-EU citizen the process of gaining UK and Irish tourism visas was hard and the Schengen visa regime is also very complex and appears to be applied in a random manner. Although not the fault of check-in staff more information should be provided to the staff to enable them to more politely deal with non-EU customers when checking in for flights.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-09-13,Dublin to Barcelona return. Had to get up at 3 in the morning for the 6.40 flight to Barcelona for a cruise. Terminal 2 at Dublin is very spacious and modern but unfortunately we found ourselves taking a long walk over to T1 for our flight. Very nice flight food was lovely - I recommend if you are flying in the morning to get the Irish Fry. Staff were friendly except for one person who was a bit rude but all in all a nice flight which landed 10 mins early. Same story returning but there was a delay at check-in at Barcelona because there was something wrong with the toe for the bags but when walking to security we passed a new modern and deserted check-in area not in use. Other than that 2 nice on time flights.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-09-12,AMS-ORK in A320s. Both flights were on time and the cabin crew friendly. In this respect they exceeded my expectations. The planes looked relatively new although on the return trip the cleaners seemed to have missed areas. The range of food/drink for purchase is excellent although the alcohol is expensive for what you get. The only real complaint is the horrible departure times they offer on this route.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-09-12,EDI-DUB-MCO return. All flights on time on all sectors of the journey. Flying Business Class has access to the Aer Lingus lounge in Dublin. Comfortable seating areas with the usual selection of snacks and drinks. Pre-clearance into the USA is an absolute positive if you fly via Dublin as once you arrive in the USA you pick up your bags and you're all set to go. Inflight service was excellent both ways. Attentive cabin crew who seemed genuinely happy to greet you. Pre-flight drinks were followed by hot and cold canapés and a substantial 3 course meal. Cabin crew continually topped up wine and water glasses without request. Seats are great in recline position and my only minor criticism would be that the flat bed is at an angle. Feels like you're about to slip of the seat however this is only a minor complaint in terms of the great service provided. If you compare the price of business class with other airlines flying to Orlando this is a great ticket especially if you book in advance.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-09-10,Cork to London Heathrow return. Once again a professional and friendly service provided both flights on time good selection of food and drink for sale. There seems to be an improvement in service over recent years offering great value for money and a decent quality of service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-09-08,Manchester to JFK via Dublin. Flight from Manchester to Dublin was delayed for 1 hr through no fault of Aer Lingus. They held the plane for us at Dublin and as soon as we arrived we were personally ushered straight through passport control and US customs. I was impressed the flight attendants friendly and helpful the food good and the inflight entertainment was excellent.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,7,2011-09-05,DUB-GVA one way. Smooth Terminal 2 less hassle at check-in airport check-in machines instead of printing your own boarding pass etc. It was a nice relaxed flight on time and the queues were fast-moving. It's not quite the level of other carriers but the premium you're paying for is smoothness and calm.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-08-29,DUB to BOS return in Economy. Both flights on A330 and both left and arrived on schedule. Staff friendly and efficient and the food was ok. Seat back TV's gave plenty of personal entertainment although the touch screen was not very responsive and you could feel the person behind you giving their screen a good hard press. I didn't find the seat particularly comfortable but ok for a short-ish transatlantic flight. Dublin airport was good my only complaint being that we didn't pre-clear customs in Dublin. Boston immigration was as usual a disgrace. We were near the front of the queue and still took more than 30mins to clear.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-08-29,DUB-ORD in Business Class. Excellent service once again - provided by professional and attentive cabin crew throughout the flight. The onboard dining experience was just perfect. IFE options have been updated in the past twelve months and are very broad. All luggage arrived promptly at ORD and we were out of the terminal within 20 minutes of landing.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-08-24,Dublin-Boston return. Enjoyed the new seats and IFE on demand. Aircraft clean and in good condition. Outward cabin crew friendly and professional. Food typical economy fare but edible. Return cabin crew friendly but a little rushed due to shortness of flight under 5 hrs. Only gripe is the pricing of alcoholic drinks. Pre-clearance of American immigration and customs in Dublin a major bonus. 15 mins from plane to bus out of Boston airport.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-08-22,LGW-DUB return. Online booking worked fine and was convenient. I didn't book any bag so got 2 flights for a very fair price at short notice. £10 seat surcharge looked unavoidable and wasn't fairly explained as optional. Printed my boarding pass at home and breezed through the airport. Pre-clearance at the gate was done professionally as well as onboard welcome. Plane was tidy uncomfortable seats with not enough legroom. Service was professional however food and drink offerings looked pricey. It didn't matter as flight time was just 45 mins. Return flight was about the same both flights on time. Good value for money. Seat improvement would be appreciated.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-08-22,Boston to Shannon recently. The service was excellent flight attendants were warm and pleasant. The food was very good along with the wines. I will continue to fly Aer Lingus.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-08-17,Chicago to Dublin return in Economy. Orderly boarding in Chicago for a full flight. Friendly and efficient cabin crew who were nicely presented. A lot of babies and small children on this flight but it was nice to see they helped families get settled quickly. Food good quality and lots of water runs during the night. Seatback entertainment very good. Immigration and baggage all fast at Dublin.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,2,2011-08-16,The trip did not live up to expectations. On line seat selection is free 30 hrs before travel so opted for this to save time at the airport. Onboard the aircraft staff were surly and struggled to smile. They enforced safety rules and procedures with an iron fist. One business man was immediately reprimanded for standing and stowing his jacket as the main door had been closed. Seat belts were worn and tatty. All announcements from the cabin crew were rushed making them hard to understand. The only advantage I can see is the use of T2 at Dublin airport.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-08-14,Dublin-Chicago and on to PDX return. I was on my own with a 22 month old I hadn't bought my child a seat so she was supposed to sit in my lap. However flights were half empty so she got her own seat which was great. Planes were generally clean and in good condition - great seat back entertainment (330). Flight attendants were helpful and attentive. One flight was delayed an hour lots of communication provided.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-08-09,I have had 12 return flights this year to the US Brussels London and Amsterdam. The move to T2 in Dublin has resulted in a great product. Ground staff in Dublin are great giving some recognition to Gold Circle members is welcome. However we have encountered some inconsistencies/lack of professionalism from some crew. I am confident these minor issues can be resolved. Overall the product is improving.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-08-09,Dublin to Faro outward flight left slightly late however time was made up in the air. Both flights full cabin crew couldn't do enough for you.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-08-09,Cork to LHR return. Flights left on time friendly crew on both sectors good selection of food and drinks for sale at reasonable prices cabin fresh and clean.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-08-08,Edinburgh for a flight to Dublin to connect to JFK return. The cabin crew on all flights were very good. Outbound staff were friendly and professional and nothing was a problem. Very informative about New York and places of interest. Excellent service. Return flight also excellent.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-08-07,Business class with my son service was wonderful. The seat was comfortable and food was very nice. I lost my bracelet down the back of the seat and the stewardess was on her hands and knees looking for it she couldn't reach it and 5 minutes after landing in Dublin a maintenance worker came on board took the seat apart and retrieved my bracelet.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-08-05,After booking at such a low fare I was a bit worried but my fears were unfounded. We boarded a very well maintained new Boeing 757 in Chicago for our trip to Dublin and Amsterdam. Two good quality hot airline meals individual LCD flat panels on each seat back with free movies shows and navigation displays. When our departure in Chicago was delayed due to a thunderstorm Aer Lingus held our connecting flight in Dublin and an employee personally escorted us at Dublin airport to make sure we made our connection.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-07-31,Dublin-Berlin return. Found T2 to be a great improvement in Dublin made a great difference. Flights on time and crew on both flights friendly and a genuine interest in passengers. If you are flying Aer Lingus on an early morning flight I recommend you try their full Irish Breakfast. Aircraft clean and comfortable and was given an exit-row on the return which was great.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-07-29,LHR to Belfast International and they were fine and efficient. Beware of feeling forced to pay for a particular seat on their website though. They give you the impression you have no choice but to pay extra to select a seat. Just wait till online check-in opens and pick the seats you need and save £10s.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-07-28,Travelled to Faro and returned to Belfast. Staff where great and the flight was on time with very comfortable seating. I travel back and forward to Great Britain on a regular basis and also to Europe and Canada I will try and book Air Lingus when possible.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-07-21,Dublin to JFK Gatwick Athens Warsaw and Krakow over the past year with Aer Lingus. Good solid service as usual despite some short delays. Aircraft are generally very clean and comfortable. Vast improvement and consistency in the entertainment system on the A330s since I last flew on one. Also had to cancel a couple of flights to Gatwick and the tax element of the fare was credited back within a couple of days. I called British Airways three times a couple of years ago for the same reason and I'm still waiting. Although AL have pitched themselves in a certain position to compete with the dreadful Ryanair their service is much more consistent than other so- called full service carriers who promise the earth but often fall short.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-07-20,DUB-JFK-DUB. Efficient check-in. Outbound flight delayed due to large numbers waiting to clear US Immigration/Customs at Dublin. On the flight the menu choice was chicken pasta or beef pasta now that you clear US customs and immigration in Dublin disembarkation at JFK was swift. The return flight left a few mins early and arrived into Dublin 45 mins ahead of time. The food was better than on the outward trip and the crew were friendly good humoured and helpful.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-07-20,Flew to Boston from Heathrow via Dublin and back. The service was very warm and the food delicious. Nothing was to much trouble for the crew and met all our requirements. The only drawback was the comfort of the seat. In whatever position the seat was in I just couldn't get comfortable. The other good point with flying via Dublin is clearing US Immigration and Customs prior to departure and landing into the US as a domestic passenger.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-07-18,DUB-LGW-DUB. Single class flight. Online check in easy as usual. SMS to remind me of my flight details a helpful new addition. New Terminal 2 a huge improvement on the old Dublin terminal. Security swift on the early morning rush. Gold Circle Lounge a huge improvement on the old one. Good choice of snacks and food. Flight left on time and efficient boarding with alot of connecting passengers from the US. Cabin Crew friendly and efficient. LGW easy exit but need to remember to have boarding pass ready to avoid passport control on fast domestic / ROI exit. Returning that evening long and inefficient on the queues if a lady is being searched on the opposite side of the X- ray why not call through the 8 gents waiting to go through. LGW should be excellent when finished but inefficient security a problem. Delay on flight on return but efficient boarding and flight. Again the crew were excellent. Arrival into Dublin excellent and to my car within 10 mins of getting off of the plane. Will use again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-07-18,JFK-Dublin. Business Class. Return leg of previous review. Efficient boarding at JFK for what was a very full flight. Great Cabin crew who did a nice meal service that wasn't too rushed but not too lengthy either giving passengers who to get some sleep the opportunity. Good Cabin Crew presence throughout the night and they certainly kept the galley noise to a minimum which was much appreciated. Slept well for 4 hrs straight and crew served a very tasty breakfast an hour out of Dublin. Priority bags out very quickly for Dublin anyway and customs a breeze. Can't fault Aer Lingus on this flight they seem to be getting the balance just right on the LCC model. Business Class fares very competitive on this route.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,1,2011-07-17,Dub-Orlando. What a poor effort by Aer Lingus. Entertainment systems on flights over and back kept breaking down so whole system had to keep getting rebooted. Kids were served one drink the whole flight then tea or coffee 45 mins before landing.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-07-13,LHR-BFS-LHR. Arrived at check-in and found a queue that stretched all the way back to Zone A (the entire length of the check-in hall). After some time waiting I and another passenger in fear of missing the bag drop cutoff for our flight left our positions and went to in search of somebody from Aer Lingus at the check-in desks. It was then a race for our flight. Narrow claustrophobic corridors and even narrower aerobridges. EI I suppose can't be held totally responsible for the terminal area assigned them by BAA or probably even the number of counters they can open but I think they could have been a little more pro-active in providing a queue host rather than wait to be prompted by waiting pax in the queue. On the return check in at BFS was smooth no queues at -90mins and despite late arrival of the inbound aircraft we left only 5 mins late. On board both flights were unspectacular and the crew polite and efficient. Although I miss the days when EI was a full-service airline and a member of oneworld they have carried off their transition to a LC carrier successfully. Their website and all rules are simple and clear and there is no ambiguity. If you want extras you pay for them and you get them if not you don't. Simple. We wanted transportation from A to B with one bag which we made sure was under 20kg followed their rules and that's what we got. Easy.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-07-12,DUB-JFK in Business class. Very impressed with all aspects of the flight. New Gold Circle lounge in Dublin's Terminal 2 is a real improvement on the old lounges. Cabin Crew just first class very friendly and efficient and nothing was too much trouble. With US pre-clearance in Dublin I'm surprised more people aren't using Dublin as a hub for transatlantic flights as the new Terminal is a breeze to get through.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-07-11,DUB-TLS-DUB. Flight out was on time but return delayed by 2 hrs because of technical difficulties on an earlier leg. Both flights were very pleasant and cabin crew friendly and attentive. The problems with recent giant carry-ons seem to have abated but if you are in row 1 you will not have access to the overhead lockers because they are used for flight equipment and crew bags. A bit on the pricey side but all in all a positive experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-07-08,DUB-MAL. Flew to Malaga recently and overall very good service. Plane was an A330 so we had IFE which was good. Plane seemed new and was very clean. The only negative is that they charge €5 for a set of ear phones to use with the IFE. However any normal ones will work so it's fine. I fly Aer Lingus and have always found them safe and reliable.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,7,2011-07-04,BRU-DUB-BRU. Flights were full on both ways and since it is a LCC service on European routes completely uneventful. They exaggerate their selling experience onboard which seems like you are in the middle of a snack- bar/shopping mall: the aisle got too busy with attendants moving about with their trollies. A bit annoying when you want to relax. However I do like the Irishness of the experience with the welcoming words in Gaelic and the green/shamrock colours everywhere. It gave me Ireland before landing in Ireland. And the flight attendants were very courteous and worked hard.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-07-03,Great flights Gatwick-Malaga-Gatwick; no hassle except Aer Lingus check-in has moved from Zone B at LGW but it wasn't reflected on my booking confirmation.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-06-19,Smiling and professional service punctuality comfortable seats with seat allocation  without paying extra like all low costs! I had left my ipod on the plane was recovered by staff and mailed back to me in less than a week. Thanks a lot Aer lingus.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-06-19,DUB-FCO MXP-DUB. Switched from Tues-Mon to avoid the stirke which never took place. No charge for the change which was nice. Both flights good usual professionalism from staff. Got back to find they had finally refunded me for a flight I didn't take because of the snow. They were not obliged to but they did which was nice. Certainly preferable to their main competitor!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,7,2011-06-10,Aer Lingus regional (operated by Aer Arann) Birmingham to Shannon. Outward flight delayed 2 hours due to technical fault - information was very poor and we were just left waiting. ATR-72 appeared old but still presentable. Flight was smooth until the descent which was extremely bumpy. Shannon to Manchester 0700 scheduled was delayed 40 minutes due to cabin crew being delayed on the previous days flight and by law are entitled to 12 hours rest. Aircraft of high standard soft leather seats top class service overall and apologies from pilot and cabin crew for the delays.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-06-07,ORD-DUB. Not the best international flight but cabin crew very friendly. We had an elderly passenger become very ill and they tended her with great professionalism and kindness.

Aer Lingus customer review,,2011-06-01,I booked and paid for LAX-Shannon round-trip. Arriving at LAX on Friday they had screwed up my booking and made me fly standby. Their next flight wasn't until Monday so if I didn't get on the plane my vacation would be severely disrupted. Their counter person said he would try to help. He then vanished from the counter not to be seen again when I (thankfully) was boarding the plane. No word of apology from him or anyone else at Aer Lingus. Completely unprofessional.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,3,2011-05-30,"Malaga to Gatwick. Have flown the route a couple of times with Aer Lingus and I think they compare favourably with Easyjet. The plane was clean crew friendly and legroom was greater. One problem though. I had paid for 2 seats but my partner was unable to fly so I had an empty seat next to me. I was asked to give it up so that a father could sit with his young son. This I agreed to do but pointed out to the stewardess that I had in fact paid for the empty seat. ""No problem"" says she ""I'll organise a refund for the unused seat"". She took all the details but I heard nothing. When I contacted customer service (a feat in itself) to follow up I was offered £5 which after several emails was increased to £27.93 when I had paid over £100. I was told that cabin crew have no authority to offer refunds. Certainly won't be prepared to offer my seat again.",False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-05-28,LHR-BFS-LHR - first time I have flown Aer Lingus since they adopted the low cost model. The only difference between then and now is a lack of business class cabin and food and drink is not free. Still a good experience. Relatively new A320s on this route and a price comparable to EasyJet who serve BFS from LTN. Staff friendly seat pitch adequate and food and drink on sale.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-05-21,Chicago-Dublin-Manchester. New A330 good legroom and decent recline. Friendly check-in staff at Chicago O'Hare and cabin staff decent food. Choice in the entertainment system could have been better. Expected free alcoholic drinks on long haul flights but charged for. Baggage handled well. Dublin airport is good - shopping food space etc and immigration staff very helpful.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-05-19,NOC-LGW with elderly infirm passenger. Friendly service from Aer Lingus at Knock Airport. They arranged a wheelchair there and then for us (normally have to warn them 48 hours prior) and got us to the plane. After nightmare journeys with Ryanair (never again) to Ireland in the past treating their passengers like animals this was much appreciated.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-05-15,Gatwick to Malaga. Excellent flight no delays comfy leather seats 32 inch seat pitch in economy compared to Thomson and Easyjet and it was a cheaper fare. Cabin crew attentive. After inflight sales they advised passengers to use call button if anything was required.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-05-02,Boston-Shannon-Boston. Plenty of leg room entertainment screens wonderful cabin crew helpful and attentive first bag checked is free. All entertainment free and they feed you as well.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,7,2011-04-21,London Gatwick-Dublin-New York Boston-Dublin-London Gatwick. New A330 on US routes excellent entertainment onboard and good food. Very kind cabin staff. We arrived at Boston airport and our flight to Shannon was delayed for 2 hours so we could not catch the flight from Shannon to London. Aer Lingus staff rebooked our flights from Boston to London via Dublin. The US immigration clearance in Dublin instead of the USA airports were also great.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,7,2011-04-12,BOS-SNN return. The outgoing flight was OK. I recently had a knee replacement and paid extra for roomier seats. The first set of seats were against the bulkhead and I found I had less room than if I had been in a regular seat where I could stretch my legs out. I did not get the same seats on the return and sat with my wife and daughter in the middle of the plane. I noticed that there was much more room. The food was good in both directions. Cabin staff were pleasant and attentive.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-03-16,Have flown return from ORK to ACE ORK to BCN and ORK to LHR in the past two months on A320. Ground service in Cork can be inconsistent. I was impressed by cabin crew and service provided with a smile. Aer Lingus provide a far superior experience than Ryanair.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,7,2011-03-15,DUB-AMS. Breezy check-in through new T2 in DUB new plane flight on time and non-eventful.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2011-03-09,DUB-ORD-DUB. Regular traveller on this route and have noticed a steep rise in average fares in the past number of months with no enhancement of service offering. A330s used on USA routes excellent; fantastic personal entertainment systems and comfortable seating however cabin crew are still very inconsistent either helpful and polite or arrogant surly and stroppy. There seems to be no middle ground! Meals and snacks are tasty but very basic and small and there is a charge for alcoholic drinks and newspapers onboard which is very petty on a long- haul flight. Aer Lingus is a quality reliable product and a much better option for transatlantic flights than US-based carriers. The new hub at Dublin Terminal 2 is a fantastic building and represents an excellent transfer/connections facility.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,7,2011-02-25,DUB-FCO and LIN-DUB. LIN-DUB delayed by inconsiderate passengers bringing huge bags on board as carry on luggage and by ineptitude of LINstaff. Aer Lingus needs to get a grip of this. Delayed half an hour as people could not seat themselves as people tried to cram bags that would not fit into overhead cabins.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,5,2011-02-22,DUB-BHX-DUB. Early morning flight to Birmingham using the new T2 fantastic building and a great service from EI ground crew. Outbound crew good but not anywhere near the Aer Lingus standard. Onboard service was standard on UK bound services. Return flight that night a disgrace. Cabin crew varied some friendly some not so friendly. They were however all extremely unprofessional messed about with the announcements joked with each other during the safety demonstration and during the inflight service.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-02-05,JFK-DUB-LGW return. A comfortable seat with adequate legroom appreciated being able to buy an exit row seat for the night flight attentive but professional cabin crew food simple but tasty. Dublin a very compact and easy transfer airport looking forward to the completion of move to the new T2.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-01-16,London Gatwick - Malaga return in economy class. Online booking was simple enough with extras available (seat selection extra baggage lounge access etc) at a reasonable cost after the booking was confirmed. My comments below refer to both the outbound and inbound flights unless otherwise mentioned. Check-in was quick and efficient with friendly staff. Oddly though check-in at Malaga opened just one and a half hours before departure despite their website suggesting that you arrive two and a half hours before. Boarding was pain free and organised with special needs passengers quietly loaded first with assigned seating there was no scrum. Cabin was clean and tidy on an A320 with standard seating and adequate leg room. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive and the in-flight service was relaxed and well performed. A good selection of food and drink was served at an unusually reasonable cost. My bacon baguette was so good I asked for another! Arrived early (by fifteen minutes in Malaga and thirty minutes in London) and was off the plane promptly. I can't comment on baggage arrival times as I had hand baggage only.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,10,2011-01-15,Gatwick- Knock flight very good. Coming home on 17th December after sitting on the plane for two hours the flight was cancelled due to cabin crew working to long because of the heavy snow and the delays. Aer Lingus were fantastic and put us up for two nights in a wonderful Hotel.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-01-11,New York to Amsterdam and back with Aer Lingus and had a great experience. Our flight was a little delayed on the way back from Amsterdam and we were afraid we'd miss our connection in Dublin. But Aer Lingus had someone waiting for us and the gate who escorted us through express security and right to the plane. Staff very friendly and helpful.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,,2011-01-09,DUB-VIE-DUB over New Year. Both flights on time. Both quite full but FA's got up and down the plane quickly with food and drink for sale. Good job all round. Very noisy crying children the only problem!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2011-01-09,LHR-DUB. Excellent flight. Very pleasant staff (becoming a rarity) In all excellent value for money. Reports that they are thinking about going back up market so long as they keep their pricing sane I'll be happy.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,,2011-01-04,Flight got cancelled and still waiting refund from this airline (4 weeks waiting without even a short answer). Customer Care-Center hasn't got a telephone number or E-Mail given on their website -small print out was the only thing we got at the airport no alternative flight or anything like that. You better pray that your flight experiences no problems or you're probably as lost as I am.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,,2010-12-28,Arrived Gatwick at 4am for 0640 flight to Malaga on 23 December only to be told my flight had been cancelled. Having been told by Aer Lingus and other airlines there were no more flights to Malaga until 27th I resigned myself to spending Christmas on my own so went home. At home 2hrs later I received a text informing me there is a special flight out at 11am - so went back to Gatwick and checked myself in. However the rest of my family who were due to fly out later that day weren't so lucky and their flight was cancelled completely with no 'special' flight available - so never made it so Spain for Christmas. My first experience flying with Aer Lingus was chaotic and disappointing and will not be using them again!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,6,2010-12-05,Woke up at 4 am to a crying 21 yr old study abroad daughter who had a flight cancelled from Rome to Dublin - Aer Lingus desk information personnel did not notify my daughter that they would rebook her trip for the next day - she in turn spent an additional $1100.00 to try to get home. She is currently in a hotel (still in Rome) and was told there would be no other compensation. She'll be flying back Alitalia.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,6,2010-11-16,JFK-DUB A330 Economy. Good service everything working properly average food polite attentive crew. I'd suggest to choose seats before flight to get a comfortable place. In general a good average service - nothing special nothing bad.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2010-10-30,DUB-JFK return A330 economy. On time comfy enough nice 3 course meal movie snack and small breakfast before landing. AVOD really good and nice selection of movies. All cabin crew friendly efficient and helpful. Pre-immigration clearance at Dublin Airport was fast and save a lot of queuing in NY. Take advantage from seat selection before you fly so you can get best seats available.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,4,2010-10-23,Gatwick to Malaga return. Was told to be at airport by 3.10am for flight at 6.10am. Gates were not opened until gone 4am by a very surly man. Same thing coming back - told to be at airport 3 hours before flight time but gates were not opened until 1.5 hours before flight. Not impressed. Have not flown Aer Lingus before. I suppose that's what you get for going cheap. Seats were comfortable with plenty of leg room.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,2,2010-10-07,Boston-Dublin A330 with 2-4-2 seating. New plane PTV entertainment friendly helpful staff and crew easy check-in on-time departure and arrival. Just one meal. Charge for all alcoholic beverages. Seats were cramped both width and leg room. Difficult to sleep since cabin lights were left on and crew was making frequent announcements throughout flight. Many were commercial announcements regarding tax-free goods. Dublin-Boston same aircraft type. Same pros and cons with one additional con - cost or change fee to re-schedule was €692. No forgiveness or consideration on non-refundable tickets. US passport control is now at the Dublin US flights departure gates. Easy to get through the passport control gates but the reduced space results in major congestion at the departure gates.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,False,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2010-09-29,ORK-MUC and BCN-ORK Excellent value for money with Aer Lingus. Both flights on-time service friendly and helpful aircraft clean and a good variety of buy onboard options. What I like about Aer Lingus is the fact that the staff aren't constantly trying to sell to you during the flight. It makes the flight a lot more enjoyable and comfortable. Pre-assigned seating also helps to avoid the boarding scrum.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2010-09-27,LHR-BFS. First time on Aer Lingus and I'd be happy to book again. Strikes delayed the aircraft's departure by 90 minutes - I was impressed that self service check-in kiosk itself adjusted the boarding time to reflect this two hours beforehand. Onboard the plane was clean comfortable and I'd picked a fair seat online a few hours before. Cabin Crews clearly more established than Ryanair and ovrall I was impressed with their courtesy and handling of the delays though amused by one lady's charming attempts to sell additional items when people ordered drinks and snacks. Ticket price from Heathrow of £35 is superb value.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,8,2010-09-25,LGW-ORK return. Good service from cabin crew a little late out of LGW but made up time on route. Good seats and value for money.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2010-09-25,BFS-LHR Flight boarded promptly and took off 15 mins early. Smooth flight to LHR crew very good and landed 20 mins early in Heathrow. Usual good service from Aer Lingus however connecting to a BA flight in First to the US and they had no priority luggage tags at Belfast to put onto our bags.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2010-09-10,Belfast Intl to Barcelona and Malaga. Good all round service. Flights on time and efficient. The best point for me was the price. These flights were a better price than budget carriers were charging.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2010-09-07,JFK-DUB-EDI GLA-DUB-JFK. Business class from JFK with a stopover in Dublin and very pleased with the experience. I felt obligated to submit a review since our experience was so positive. Business class seating was very nice as we had the newer aircraft both ways. Seats are angled lie-flat but compared favorably to LH’s Business seats. Fairly decent selection of movies and TV shows although the audio selections weren’t wonderful. Flight Attendants in both directions were very attentive. The food was surprisingly good. We were on the late flight out of JFK so there was supposed to be a light meal service with full breakfast in the morning. We started with tasty canapés followed by an optional cold chicken plate — optional because some people chose to sleep right away. The only disappointment was breakfast as the eggs were overcooked. Dinner on the way back was very good with smoked salmon to start and good beef as a main. Both business class check-ins were very quick and pleasant. The lounge at JFK was very nice and food was actually very good. The only downside was that it was outside of security so we had to make sure to allow enough time after relaxing in the lounge. The lounge at Dublin was very nice although with limited food. We had to deal with two economy class check-ins and flights DUB-EDI and GLA-DUB and both were painless. The agent at GLA checked our bags all the way through to JFK even though the two legs had been booked separately. One bag did not make it to JFK but it was located and delivered the next day. All in all it was a great deal for good business class service. We would definitely do it again on the same routes although we probably wouldn’t want to be in a full economy class plane going from DUB to Athens or Rome.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2010-09-06,BHX-Dublin-Orlando return. Quick check-in at BHX short flight to Dublin. Pleasant airport waiting for connection. Flight to Orlando food quality and quantity very good as was the seat-back inflight entertainment - our 2 children were kept very happy! Return the same food not as good but still acceptable and flights on-time. The cabin crew on all flights were very friendly and helpful. Only downside our cases weren't transferred at Dublin and followed on the next flight and delivered to our home the next day - according to staff at BHX this happens regularly with transfers. Not impressed with airport security at Dublin - wife bought a bottle of water at Orlando departure lounge and a very rude and self-important security woman grabbed it out of her hand and threw it in a bin when we arrived. But then within 10 feet of security you can buy another over-priced bottle - what's that all about? She missed the 2 cups of airline water in our hand luggage though!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
Aer Lingus customer review,9,2010-09-05,LHR-SNN return. Good flights and service. Fairly no-frills but you don't need that much on a short flight. At least you have an assigned seat. Would always use Aer Lingus in preference to Ryanair.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,True,
