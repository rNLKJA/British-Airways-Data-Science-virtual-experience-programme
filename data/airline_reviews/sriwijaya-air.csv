His limited English made it a problem to communicate, but essentially he said the same thing as the stewardesses. When I approached him again to ask if he could at least tell me how to get to Malang, he couldn't help me. Thank goodness for another traveller that was in the same boat as me - he 'took me under his wing' and helped me get on a shuttle to the bus terminal (one hour), then through the madness at the terminal and onto the bus for Malang (2.5 hrs), and then to a taxi to my hotel (20 mins). Meaning that not only did I receive no notification that my flight had been changed, no assistance in reaching my actual destination, but it added almost 4 hours to my already 20 hour long commute from the Philippines.",False,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Jakarta to Malang/Surubaya,December 2015,2,1,,1,1,,False,

"""flights running several hours late""",3,2015-10-15,"In our experience the flights are usually running several hours late. We recently lost half a day of our holiday in Bali because of Sriwijaya Air delays - supposed to arrive early afternoon, but arrived late at night. You might need assistance from staff (eg families with young children, elderly people). We arrived at the (domestic) check-in 35 mins prior to departure, struggling with bags and two toddlers. We eventually got the attention of one of the ground staff, who told us we were too late (official policy is you should arrive 45 mins prior) and had missed the flight. Then he walked off and just left us. No help rescheduling to another flight, etc. Thankfully there is now a lot of competition in the low budget airline industry in Indonesia, so shop around. In this price range, we would recommend Citilink, which in our experience doesn't have the above problems.",False,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bali to Jakarta,October 2015,2,2,,1,2,,False,
"""really disappointing experience""",1,2015-09-23,"A friend and I were due to fly Sriwijaya Air from Jakarta to Makassar. We arrived 2.5 hours before the flight and were told the flight (which was due to leave at 09.20) had been delayed until 10.00. All the information boards said 'departure now at 10.00' and the check-in staff confirmed this and wrote 'Be at gate for 9.25' on our boarding passes. We went for a coffee and turned up at the gate at 09.25 as instructed to be told the flight had left on time in the end. We were then told the check-in staff must be wrong and ""you should never check the information boards"" (which still read delayed until 10.00). The management staff refused to look at the boards and eventually blamed the airport authorities. No announcements were made or efforts to find us despite us sitting in the only cafe inside the terminal. The attitude from the staff was really poor and they were totally unhelpful. Their only suggestion was to book another flight with the airline - which was 12 hours later and we would have to pay again. No refund or further help was offered and the staff would walk away after shouting at us and then return unable to have a sensible conversation. We submitted a complaint since arriving home - I would advise avoiding this airline if possible as there are plenty of other domestic Indonesian airlines that are fair and Sriwijaya really let us down. A really disappointing experience.",False,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Jakarta to Makassar,September 2015,1,1,,1,1,,False,
"""fairly new aircraft and good staff""",6,2015-09-08,"Denpasar to Dili with Sriwijaya Air, and mostly okay. Check-in in Bali was a bit disorganised but once I got to the front of the line, I was dealt with quickly. Inflight staff were generally good and professional, speaking Indonesian and English. The only problem being their aggressive promotion of duty free goods, including leaning across me for long periods while their scarfs fell all over the place. Also offsetting the service was the worst inflight meal I've ever had. I think it was a battered fish fillet but it was so tough it could also have been chicken. It came with cold fries and some tinned vegetables that were the best part of the meal. Doesn't matter, it was a short flight. With fairly new aircraft and good staff, Sriwijaya Air probably one of the best Indonesian regional airlines.",False,Boeing 737-800,Business,Economy Class,Denpasar to Dili,September 2015,3,4,,3,3,,True,

Sriwijaya Air customer review,7,2013-08-22,Flew CGK-SIN with Sriwijaya Air to make a change from the usual Lion Air Air Asia etc. Booked online only 48 hours before for the bargain price of 40 USD one-way. Check-in was fine with no queue and was lucky to get a retro boarding pass from a dot-matrix printer. We left 45 mins late but they apologised profusely Only about 20 passengers on the flight however the cabin crew told me the return flight from SIN was full. Aircraft was a Boeing 737-300 in surprisingly good condition and the captain was Australian. The only disappointment was the food - a strange combination of scrambled egg half frozen French fries and carrots. However it was still edible and at least food is free unlike the LCCs.
