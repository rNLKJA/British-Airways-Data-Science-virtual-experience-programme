"""turned my trip with into a complete nightmare""",1,2022-10-07,"Not Verified |  Delta Airlines turned my trip with My 3 Kids into a complete nightmare. We were flying from Atlanta-GA to New York, then Tel Aviv - Israel. A trip that I had been doing for years with different Airlines. On December, 18th 2021, I got to the Airport 3 hours before the flight, as they requested, but the check-in line was moving extremely slowly. After about 1 hour and a half, I asked an employee to please help us make it in time for our flight. He assured me that we had enough time. Another half hour went by and I saw this person again. I went towards him and said I had one more hour to my flight with my kids and there were still a lot of people in front of me. Again, he was dismissive and said we would be able to make it on time. We finally made it to the check-in desk, got our boarding passes to the NY flight and the connecting flight to Israel and ran to security. I took it upon myself and apologized to all the people we were passing to get through security and get to our gate. Just as we got to the gate, the plane was already moving. We got there late. I was livid and I made it very clear that I was angry. The problem was that they knew we were on our way. We had already checked in, our names were on the list with assigned seats, and we had the boarding passes in our hands. I’m willing to bet that due to extremely bad management, they overbooked the plane; that is why they quickly closed the door and allowed the plane to take off. Eventually, a Delta Employee was able to put my kids and I on another flight to NY.  When we got to the gate, they had just closed it and refused to reopen it. I said to the employee “You knew we were on our way, our names were on the list. Why didn’t you wait for just 2 minutes? She did not answer, but again it’s obvious that they overbooked the plane. By now, I was going to miss our flight to Israel as well. I don’t think there was anyone on that terminal that did not hear my voice when I was yelling and screaming off the top of my lungs that Delta and its management are nothing but screw-ups and they don't care about their clients At this point someone came and told me she could help and would make sure that I would be on the next flight. However, we were going to miss the flight to Israel but there would be another flight in the evening that we would have to wait for (if I’m not mistaken about 6 hours). I did not care. I asked her to do whatever needed to be done. She started transferring our boarding passes from the flights we lost to the new flight to NY and the flight to Israel that same evening. However, she was only able to issue my and two of my kids boarding passes, but was having a problem getting the boarding pass for my other son. Time was getting very close to the flight going to NY, so she asked me to leave and in NY they would get him the boarding pass. When we got to NY, the first thing I wanted to do was to get my son his boarding pass. I went immediately to the Delta desk; the person there was taking forever, then someone else came in and started asking my son for his permit to travel and his Covid test. I told them that we had already been through this and he already had a boarding pass, but because of Delta’s poor management and flawed service, we lost 3 flights. All they needed to do was transfer his boarding pass to the next flight. However, this process was also taking long.

No serious complaints for an airline with which I have rarely had negative experiences over the years - from the perspective of being an actual customer of the airline.

The host organization already had a process in place. We researched the unaccompanied minor rules and regulations. The host organization would have someone waiting to meet with him at the gate in Japan. No problem.

There was a gentleman standing next to us and he said he had a tracker on his luggage and it showed it was still at the plane. People started complaining about our luggage not arriving. Shortly after they announce on the intercom that they had forgot a cart of luggage at the tarmac. Of course it was pouring outside and everything was getting soaked.

Did not hear from them in next 2 hours, while I was waiting at the check-in counter. Conclusion: Delta do not provide any assistance. Operations is the critical component of their business. I would care less if an airline avoids delays and disruptions (except in cases of extreme weather). For an international traveller, it is not east to navigate airports, or make alternative arrangements in a foreign country, that too in a situation where airport staff speaks language other than yours'. While booking the DeltaOne, my agent warned me that delta flights are often delayed. I gave it a shot nevertheless.

And I did not understand where the staff kept disappearing intermittently. For two and a half hours that I was in checkin line (Sky priority is a joke), I noticed staff behind screen varied between 1 and 4. Perhaps Delta is short staffed. When I managed to reach check-in counter, the lady said I cannot check-in luggage as the deadline for baggage checkin is closed. So, either travel next day (which was not feasible for me) or take bag to the gate. Catch is, I had liquids in checkin bag. So, I had to throw them away. Remember, sometimes it is not about stuff but emotions attached to it. I had something special to me in the bag (Hence my resolve to avoid Delta as much as I can). The thing that made me furious is that flight stood at the gate for another 1hour 15 minutes after boarding completed.

"""by far my worst flying experience""",1,2022-06-24,This is by far my worst flying experience in my life and I’ve been flying since the age of 4 which is 40 years ago and I’ve flown with many international airlines across the globe. This airline is a joke doesn’t even qualify to be a budget LLC. I flew with them 4 sectors all in first class including delta one. First leg was SEA-LAX first class in a very old 30+ years old B737 after boarding and take off and the pilot switch off the seat belt sign I asked the notorious cabin crew if I can use the toilet and I was the very first passenger to use what’s supposed to be the first class cabin toilet and it was filthy and floor full of water and when I informed the FA he said yes it’s flooding. Prior to my departure Delta sent me via their app to choose my meals and since I have specific dietary requirements I choose what’s suitable for me. When the FA was offering the meals he came to me and with a very low and unclear tone he offered me what options they have and when I told him I have a special meal request he said we don’t serve that on domestic flights so eventually I took the oat meal with some shea seeds which turned to be an awful non edible option. After landing and waiting for my luggage I found my suitcase was damaged beyond repair I went to Delta luggage service desk I spoke with the employee who was very unhelpful and not interested to be working she just did a form and gave it to me with a tracking number and till today after almost a month still I didn’t hear from their customer service. My 2nd leg was from LAX-JFK supposed to be with B767-400 the newly refurbished delta one. As per Delta email prior to departure we need to be 2 hrs prior to departure at the airport which is 4am I was there on time and they said there is a dedicated lounge for delta one passengers .

We waited till 4:30am one one employee finally showed up and opened the partition and we did our check in finally. The only positive thing was the new delta lounge at LAX . Food options were horrible though. We boarded surprisingly to a very old dirty B767-300 with the old version of Delta one seats. Probably 25+ years old aircraft which was falling apart. Started taxing on time however for almost 1 hr the pilot was taxing around the airport and at 7 am he informed us we are going back to the gate as the plane developed a technical problem which need another hr of repair and we ended up sitting on board for another 2 hrs without even a glass of water or any interaction from the crew we eventually took off at almost 9 am 3 hrs behind our schedule and to my surprise the FA came to me and said you requested for a special meal and it’s ready so they actually serve pre ordered meals on domestic flights.

"""Very disappointed with value for money""",4,2022-06-16,"Not Verified |  Delta's non-international first class is to me, a waste of money. I travelled from Sarasota, FL to Kansas City International return and spent $293 extra for first class over the comfort plus seating. Both trips were via Atlanta. I had never travelled first with Delta, so thought I would give it a try. You get early boarding, but as your seat is designated, that is really unimportant. There are as much booze and hot/cold drinks as you want, but no food, only snacks. The second leg, ATL-KCI, was over 2 hours. Delta should serve at least a sandwich/yoghurt etc for that duration. As the journey is under 900 miles you are stuck with snacks. The seats on the Boeing 757-200 and 737-900 have no lumbar support at all and I found them very uncomfortable. Bring a pillow or inflatable cushion would be my advice. On the 737, I was at the back of first class and my seat had zero recline. It was all that was available when I purchased the ticket. I had 2.5 and 3.5 hour waits at Atlanta for the next plane and was hoping as I paid for first class, a lounge would be available. No such luck. You have to be an international traveller or own a special credit card, like Delta's own or I think, AmEx. On Delta's website, I could not find any info about lounge availability, so emailed them. I'm still waiting for a reply some 3 weeks later. I tried to call, do you really need me to tell you the wait time? It's true you have 21 ins of seat width and 37 inch pitch.

"""staff in ATL need training""",1,2022-06-15,"The first leg of the flight from DFW to Atlanta was nice. My husband and I landed a few minutes early, however, once we stepped off the plane, everything changed. We endured the worst airport experience ever in our combined 109 years. We had 1 hour to deboard and take the train to another terminal to catch our connecting flight to Panama City, FL (ECP). After rushing to get to the other terminal, we were disappointed to see on the screen that our flight to ECP had been canceled. About that same time I received a text from Delta that due to the inconvenience, they would provide us with a complementary hotel room from a list of hotels they provided and a complementary meal. I attempted to reserve a room at one of the hotels provided, only to find that all within 30 miles of the airport were booked. We made our way back to the main terminal and proceeded to stand in a long and winding line at the ticket counter. By this time, it was about 10:30 pm. While waiting in line, I checked the Delta website for the next flights going to ECP. There were no more flights that night, all flights the following day were sold out, and all were sold out two days later except for the late flight that had a few seats remaining. I called Delta Customer Service thinking this may be quicker than waiting in line at the airport, however, the wait time to speak with a CSR was 3+ hours. After waiting in line for over 2 hours and next in line, a Delta staff member walked by the line and asked what we needed. I explained our situation that our connecting flight was canceled, according to website all flights were sold out the next 2 days and none of the complementary hotels had rooms available and was told ""you'll have to wait until next week to get to FL."" About that time, another Delta staff member said they were closing the line down because it was past time for them to go home. We proceeded to the baggage area and waited another hour in line to get our bags and were advised we could not get them that they would be on the 8 am flight to ECP and we could get them whenever we got to ECP, By this time it was 1:30 am. We had to find our own hotel and transportation ($230 + $60 to hotel + $30 from hotel) and planned on renting a car and driving so we didn't lose 2 more days of our vacation. After getting 3 hours of sleep, we returned to the airport and stood in line at Dollar Rental for 2.5 hours before deciding to go back to the airport terminal to see if they had any seat cancellations to ECP or other airports within 2 hours. We waited in line 2 more hours to finally get a Delta staff member who actually was trying to help. She was able to get me on a late afternoon flight and my husband on a flight that evening. I received a $100 credit from Delta for the inconvenience (my husband did not) and $15 voucher for a meal. But, considering we spent $320 on the hotel and transportation to and from hotel, and lost a day of vacation, we are out several hundred. Not to mention I canceled the return flight and rebooked on SW and only received a partial credit. Although I realize there is a shortage in pilots and many flights are being canceled, there needs to be a process set up to ensure those whose flights have been canceled are rescheduled on flights as soon as possible, instead of standing in line after line and not getting anything accomplished.

After enduring the additional 8 hours at the airport it’s finally time to check in and get on the plane.

"""I am feeling very deterred to ride with Delta again""",2,2022-04-06,"Not Verified |  Let me just start by saying, riding with Delta this past Sunday was a major inconvenience. On April 3rd I arrived at the airport around 4am to catch my 6.45am flight that would later connect to another flight in ATL. My first flight of that day went smoothly, and I took note as to how the different groups of passengers were being called as to not overcrowd the area. As I had previously flown into CHI using a connecting flight, I had plans to be back in Austin by 12pm so that I could make it to work later that day. When I arrived in ATL, I walked over to station B28 as to be ready to board the plane. I arrived early and I paid close attention as the passengers were called to board the plane, however the screen never changed from saying “PRORITY”. As the announcer called passengers, she announced 1st class, main cabin 1, main cabin 2 and main cabin 3 but to my confusion she never announced BASIC. As time neared for my flight to leave, my roommate and I walked over to the station to ask when they would announce for “BASIC” to board the plane. I watched as a woman and her daughter were helped to board the plane and I stepped up to be boarded right after her. The lady spoke with me and said “I’ll be right back” before closing the door to the plane in front of me and a group containing at least 5 other passengers. The conversation that commenced after her return was very sad when referring to customer service. Not only was she rude to me as a passenger but she seemingly taunted the fact that my flight left without me on board. As she faced me, there was a lady in a red suit to her left who also claimed she wanted to help but offered a 4.40pm flight as a substitute for my 10am flight, omitting the fact that there was a 12.30am flight that she had access to add us to as standby passengers. Both ladies are a poor excuse for employees at a company that is supposed to pride themselves in customer service. Taking the conversation from 0 to 100, I believe it took more effort to be rude then it did to just help us and apologize for the inconvenience. They argued the fact, saying that I was not at the door when I clearly contacted her before she turned her back on me. Not only were the two ladies rude but they seemingly meant harm in their demeanor, and they wanted my flight to leave me behind. As a customer, I am feeling very deterred to ride with Delta again because if I paid for a flight, I should be able to ride on my flight without complications and poor attitudes from staff. I feel these two ladies were upset with the fact that passengers were slow to accept checking their luggage and they decided to take out their frustrations on the passengers. After getting help at the main Delta help desk, I felt like the employee wanted to be helpful, but the conversation could only be what I feel was “he said she said.” As the lady could do nothing to help me further with submitting a complaint about my previous interaction with the staff at B28 at 10am. The rude behavior from your Delta employees persisted and even as I was placed on standby flight for 12:31am I was still not properly confirmed on my flight. I went to the desk of station B5 and when I asked if he could explain what “standby” meant he rudely told me “Look at the screen” as he continued his conversation with a coworker.

And they are generally rude and unhelpful after I spend hours trying to make contact. I have been cut off several times after being connected. The virtual assistants are terrible, too. How can a computer be so stupid? It has been programmed into it. The virtual assistants keep repeating the same information and questions and do not understand what is input by voice or typed.

"""my first experience on Delta Air Lines and this will be my last""",1,2022-03-25,"I am very unhappy. My plane was set to leave at 7.20pm then only 5 hours prior to the flight the plane was delayed and moved to 10.10pm and then they changed it to 8.40pm takeoff and then after boarding 30 minutes later then the boarding time of 8.0pm we are sitting on the plane for over two and a half hours on the runway. They say we’re about to take off and then we are just waiting around for two hours on the plane completely claustrophobic, not COVID friendly whatsoever and all they tell us is that they have to wait to switch directions. After they said they were able to get an alternative route they say the plane doesn’t have enough fuel to do the alternative route and say we have to go back to the gate. Then we are told that the plane isn’t allowed to take off and that we are 'fortunate' to have a gate to come back to because some planes have to just sit and wait on the runway when their is no available gates. My question is, if you originally had the flight at 7.20 departure and then delayed it to 10.10 why would you then undelay it and then only move it to 8.40? Because we’ve been on the plane for more than the second delay time of 10.10. I am extremely disappointed. This was my first experience on Delta Air Lines and this will be my last! I have flown on 100+ legs, over 10 different countries and I have never experienced an issue like this before. At least on my other airplane experience they kept us informed. Delta is not transparent and clearly is aware of the situation so why move the delay down just to have everyone sit on the plane for 4 hours past the original departure time? This is the time that I should be arriving at my destination. And the only thing they tell us is “sorry” and then offer our headphones to people and say “these are normally $2 but we’re giving them away because of the delay”. Two dollar headphones treating it like they are doing us a huge favor, they should at the very least give us food. I am blown away and shocked by the unprofessionalism of the company. Then they kick everyone off the plane after sitting in it for hours and tell us the staff needs to go home because they’ve been overworked and can’t go over their hours and that we need to just wait to see what will happen and when they will get new staff and they kept reiterating that the flight was not going to be cancelled only delayed, and then boom after waiting from 5.45pm to 12.45am (7 hours) I find out that our 1.42am (delayed 5 times) is now cancelled. They told me the next flight at 6am is fully booked and then next flight will arrive around at 6pm on Friday. I am missing an entire day in my destination zone and my original flight I had picked specifically based off the time to make sure I would not be missing any work and now I am missing an entire day worth of work and who’s going to reimburse me for that? And also let my job know? I think after waiting 7 hours for a flight where the staff decided to disappear and sitting inside an airport breathing in the air of other people who could potentially have COVID during this pandemic. Completely unacceptable whatsoever. Delta can state that the plane was cancelled due to weather but I don’t agree with that, they are using that as an excuse so that they are no liable for my flight and all the people who had to sit around for 7 hours waiting with full hope for a flight that got cancelled when the crew left.

"""staff were pleasant and accommodating""",9,2022-02-05,"First, I don't quite understand the overwhelming number of horrible ratings on United in particular and US carriers in general. I am not sure if I was lucky or I am not demanding, but my experience with the airline was quite fine so far (knock on wood). It is certainly not top notch but not horrible either. I, for sure, have encountered unpleasant experiences, but that happened to me even with the best rated airline. I think US carriers' weak spot is ground operations, with so many short, small flights that are plagued with delays, cancellations and gate changes (Asian full-service carriers use wide-body aircrafts even on one-hour flights). Now, here is my opinion about this particular flight. Ground service at EWR for Premier class was seamless but not exemplary, and that was certainly below the level of Delta One. In-flight hard product was where this flight shined. The 787-10 was shiny and clean. The Polaris seats were comfortable, spacious, and last but not least, provided a great deal of privacy. This was one of, if not the best equipment for a 5-6 hour flight I ever experienced, even when compare with intra-Asia business class from top rated airlines. On board staff were pleasant and accommodating. Food choices were limited, but I can see improvement on the taste. Food service and presentation was not quite at, though were inching back to, pre-pandemic level. The flight departed on-time and arrived early, but we were still late as we had to wait for our arriving gate, a LAX signature. The IFE screen was nice and responsive, though movie selections were not as good as what on Delta.

We are traveling with small children and by law they can not sit by themselves. We found out about the seat changes trying to check in 24hrs in advance. We could not fix our seats together and were told (after holding for 6 hours on the phone) to wait until we reached the gate. We arrived at the airport and there was only one gate attendant with a long line of customers. She was not attending to any of them. Finally someone in line spoke up and she was flustered. She dismissed half of the people in line to go sit down. They were told to deal with their issue at the scanning of boarding passes. We were still seat separated from our children. I finally spoke up and she addressed the situation to get us seated together. Our flight departed a bit late and upon approach into BNA our captain notified us that there was heavy weather and we may have to divert to Memphis. He circled three times and aborted the landing at BNA. We landed in Memphis (1/2 hour from BNA) and are notified that we need to refuel before we can go back and to land at BNA as the storm has now cleared. We now hear from the Captain on the PA that he and his cockpit crew have ""timed out"". We are asked to deplane and wait for alternative cockpit crew.

This was my first and LAST time flying Delta. I had originally booked a roundtrip, direct flight from ONT to ATL months in advance. Then, a few weeks before, the scheduled flight Delta kept changing my return home flight time (3 times). Eventually they had changed it from a departure time of 5pm to 8am, which is a huge difference in time change. Not only did they change the time, but they changed the return airport from ONT to LAX! I was not ok with either of these drastic changes to the flight I originally booked. I called a Delta representative and told him what had happened. He told me he could make the changes and reschedule me to a direct 4:30pm flight. I assumed things were fixed. It wasn’t until the day before my return flight, when I was supposed to check in, did I realize that he still had my flight booked for the wrong airport (LAX). I then had to spent over 3 hrs on hold waiting to speak to a Delta customer service representative, and over a half hour talking to someone to get my flight fixed.

We stood in a very long line with only 2 employees at the counter, and we received a hotel voucher for the Radisson which gave us a $40 discount, we still had to pay $108 for the hotel room which was shocking to us! We were also told that we would use the same tickets we had tomorrow morning at the Atlanta Airport. When we asked an Atlanta Airport employee where the shuttle was for the hotel, he looked at us completely clueless and like he was under hard influence of something, so we kept walking and hoped we would eventually find the shuttle ourselves!

We had booked this trip almost 6 months prior, and I had a choice of seats, and picked out the ones I wanted. However this flight was switched a few months back, and although they specified to check the schedule change, which I did, and there was just a few minutes difference in time. I did not think that I would have to check my seats, as I assumed they would transfer with the flight. They did not! I found this out the day before our flight, and I scrambled to find adjoining seating for the 4 of us, and was successful in locating seating for us, it was in the middle and not window seats like I had originally chosen. I called Delta hoping that I would be able to speak with an agent and get things changed. I was told by a recorded message that the wait time could be up to 3 hrs! which is ridiculous, however, I was determined to speak to someone to get changes made to our seating arrangement. 1 hr went by, and then 2! Still no answer. After waiting until 3 hrs and 3 minutes, I decided i had had enough, and took a screen shot to prove to Delta that I had tried to make changes to my seating arrangements to no avail!. On to Baggage Check. Check-In went reasonably well, and the Baggage Check-In Process went fairly quickly. This was the first time we had flown Delta in a long time. We usually travel using Southwest, and are used to their Baggage Check-In and Boarding Process. Needless to say, I was surprised at the baggage fees we were charged. On Southwest your baggage is free! Not the case with Delta. It cost $30 for the 1st checked bag and $40 for a second. For the 4 of us we had 6 bags, and it cost me $200! I should have done more checking on this prior to purchasing tickets. The only reason for flying Delta in the first place was that they fly larger jets to Hawaii than Southwest, and so we thought we'd be more comfortable, which we later found out not to be the case. Next came the boarding process, and after waiting for everyone else to board, finally it was our turn to go and find our seats that I was forced to endure. Our connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake City was delayed due to an air conditioning issue? In any case it caused enough of a delay that when we landed in Salt Lake City, we were told that they were doing a final boarding call for our flight to Maui. We ran with our carry on luggage down the concourse for about a quarter mile or so, and they were just closing the door on the jetway and informed us that we had just barely made it. We told them that there were a couple of others from our flight also on their way, but they did not seem concerned, and closed the jetway door behind us. Flight to Hawaii was pretty uneventful, but while our beverage requests were taken care of, it was evident that the flight attendants were not happy with their jobs. It seemed like everything that we asked of them was a burden. The snacks are another thing. No variety at all. We were offered the same snacks over and over on each of the 4 legs of our trip. Almonds and Biscoff cookies.  We will be flying Southwest next time.

"""we paid for a first class experience, and did not receive it""",3,2021-05-28,"Not Verified |  May 21st – May 25th 2021, we flew to EYW from PWM with LGA as a stopover. We’d flown to Key West in FLA in October 2020 First Class and Tampa in January Comfort Plus, and loved both trips. What we didn’t realize is that the planes we’d be flying on this time around were smaller. 2 seats on one side, 1 on the other. There was no separation, which eliminated the “exclusive” feel we’d enjoyed with our first trip. Additionally, there were no TV screens. On the December flight, we were able to watch entire feature films. Additionally, each of the four legs of the trip were different in terms of food or drink service. Leg 1 - PWM to LGA we were offered snack boxes in addition to water, drinks, etc. On the shorter LGA to EYW, we were not offered the boxes. On the return trip, no snack boxes were even offered. Added to the substantially downgraded “first class” experience due to the smaller aircraft, this all contributes to an overall sloppy and inconsistent feel, that is to say, “You never know what you’re going to get until you get on board”. On the leg back, we were looking forward to a couple of the new margaritas in the can. They were amazing, having discovered them on the way down. But, they only packed 2 cans for the whole trip for the plane, the attendant says this happens a lot. We’ve had similar experiences where we weren’t able to get water because you’d run out of the little 8 oz bottles. That’s just unacceptable. (As a side note, an 8 oz bottle of water on a 2-3 hour flight offers little in the way of meaningful hydration. I generally ask for two for each of us. Perhaps a more practical size would be more appropriate?) At the Key West airport on the leg back to LGA, we were the last ones to board. Why? Because the young attendant did not call first class. When we asked about it, she said, “well I called Diamond, that’s the same thing.” Well, no, it’s not. This same attendant was very unhelpful when we asked her about boarding passes. On our last trip to KW we had to print boarding passes vs. using our mobile ones. She said she didn’t really know, they prefer printed but that we should be able to use the mobile, well, can we use them or not? Finally, I’m hard of hearing. I understand that there’s not a lot that can be done because of the mask wearing mandates, but you’ve really got to teach your employees how to make clear announcements. How to annunciate properly, speak reasonably slowly and loudly enough. I’ve never felt so discriminated in my life, having to ask people around me if you’d said anything important. (Most of them didn’t hear the announcements either). On the first leg from PWM to LGA there was one young lady who was wonderful. Every other attendant gave us the impression that we were a bother. So all in all, we paid for a first class experience, and did not receive it on several fronts. We found little similarity between our December & January first class trips and this one. We’re seriously disappointed, and will be sure to ascertain what type of plane we’ll be flying on and get clear on boarding and offerings. Additionally, as a direct result of our disappointment, we plan to book our next first class trip with either AA or United.

I live 20 minutes from the airport and I chose Delta because it was a direct flight. These are difficult to get from Scotland as BA does not route a single flight from Scotland to the USA. You have to go via Heathrow. First May email comes saying not only am I now leaving at 6.00am in the morning instead of 10.30 but from Edinburgh to Amsterdam and then Amsterdam to New York - 15.5 hours. Delta fly daily from Edinburgh to JFK and while I understand they might have cancelled some of them due to Covid I did not expect them to cancel every, single flight. Every, single, day. I was quite surprised because when I tried to book by seats quite few were already taken. So many people have been inconvenienced. I had booked on the premise that if Scotland was shafted yet again as the easy option, they would fly me from another airport, one within the UK. They fly from Heathrow on both Delta operated flights and code share with Virgin too. But they routed me backwards via Amsterdam. Nine hours after I left the house for my 20 minute trip to the airport, I would be back over UK airspace again, right back to where I started.  They would not put me any of the Heathrow flights because they would have to pay BA to fly me there from Edinburgh and they do not code share with them.  They would not give me my money back because I am not American. US law means they have to refund American citizens if they cancel flights with no comparable alternative but as they advised me, they can pretty much do what they want with others. No legal requirement to compensate me or route me even from the same country. I could rebook but they would keep my money until I did. For a year. Then they would keep it all.  So, I had to cancel and rebook from Heathrow and pay the cost of getting myself a return flight from Edinburgh to Heathrow. Apart from the totally inconvenient flight times and flight changes from direct to indirect flights and 2 set sets of immigration to queue up for, I had no wish to have to check if 2 countries still had their borders open to UK citizens until 22nd June. If you live in the EU then Book with European airline in these uncertain times.

They announce the flight was overbooked and offered $400 for someone to take a later flight. No one took it. Eventually they landed on $600 and someone gave in. $600? I got a $50 hotel room to wait an entire day. Moving on, we go to board and they gave each of us separate seats.

"""great experience with Delta in a pandemic""",9,2021-03-12,"Delta is normally my backup airline. But it became my primary during the pandemic. I was moving from OKC to Denver, so this was a one way flight. Although there were nonstop flights to Denver I could've taken out of OKC, I chose Delta regardless if I had to take two flights to get to my destination cause they still had social distant seating on all their flights. Which made me feel comfortable since it'd be my first time flying since the pandemic started. Check in at OKC wasn't a hastle. Since I have a Gold Card, they still accepted my bag even though it was a few pounds over the limit. At the gate, I spoke to the agent handling boarding about the precautions. She was very nice and descriptive about their cleanliness and cleaning procedures. She was kind enough to give me a goodie bag filled with cookies, sanitizing wipes and a thank you post card. Flight to SLC from boarding to landing was ontime, smooth and pleasant. Connection at SLC was a little surprising. I learned we'd be deplaning at a remote spot and be bussed to the terminal due to construction I wasn't aware they were doing on some of the terminals. When we deplaned, we had to share two buses with another flight that had just arrived. Both buses ended up being at full capacity. Meaning we weren't able to social distance for the entire bus ride. In this environment, that was dangerous to do. I feel Delta could've done a better job mitigating this issue. Afterwards, the rest of the connection was fine. Boarded, departed and arrived on time. Flight attendants on the flight were nice enough to let me move to an empty row because of my discomfort of sharing a row with another passenger, even though the middle seat was open. Overall, great experience with Delta in a pandemic. If they could just be more cautious about their remote stand connection process, that would be best. I have plans to fly Delta again in a month while they still have their social distant seating arrangement. Looking forward to it and experiencing a different connection process in SLC.

"""I'd rather fly Spirit""",1,2020-07-11,"Thanks Delta, for reminding me that my pockets are not deep enough for you all to care how me or my property is treated. I've been lied to, witnessed a clear violation of how things are supposed to be handled, and I've been ghosted. Some backstory: relocating as a remote worker. I packed my work equipment with multiple layers of bubble wrap and clothing, put them into a box, and sealed it with guerilla tape. I checked my box as an oversized special item to prevent any mishandling. The lady at the counter marked the box as fragile and oversized. She then told me that I could claim the item in a designated area as it would not drop down the conveyor belt. She then asked me to sign away all liability saying that they'll take REASONABLE care of my property but aren't liable for damages. Well, Delta's definition of reasonable care means that they'll stack boxes on top of a box marked fragile, send it over to standard baggage claim tumbling down the conveyor belt, bend the box(how?), Then the coup de grâce, puncture the box and it's content. So I see the box tumbling down the conveyor belt and I'm dmbfounded. This is not what was discussed. Its about to flip over the sides since it tumbled end over end but luckily It caught balance and landed with a thump back onto the belt. I go to the counter to explain to the lady who's clearly annoyed, what happened to my box. She asked me to test if everything in there works. I couldn't find the wires for the monitors and we ended up speaking to LAX. I pointed out every bend and hole on the box saying, this isn't reasonable care. After seeing the box the agent said I can go home to buy wires and test the monitors within 24hrs, email him and then we'll work something out if it's broken. I'm guessing this was to just get me out of the airport because he later ghosted me. The next morning I got some new wires and plugged in my BenQ which worked fine. I then unwrap my dell 27"" ultrasharp ips monitor and see what appears to be a hole that's penetrated the first two layers of the screen. Naive and hopeful, I plug in the monitor thinking that it'll still work and if it's just a scratch then I can live with that. But after plugging it in That scratch started to look more like fractures as the screen begin to illuminate. It was done. I called Delta's help support number, when I finally got through to someone I barely got out half a sentence before being interrupted. The gentleman proceeded to interrupt me a few more times until I finally got my story out and after a final interruption I just hung up. I emailed Scott to update him on the progress I had made, I also sent a message via Facebook messenger to Delta to figure out how to actually put a claim in for the issue. Scott replied back thanking me for keeping him in the loop. I finally got a ticket submitted and within an hour someone had already denied my claim. They offer me $250 travel coupon. I absolutely decline and you can remove it from my account then remove my account. I send another message to the agent , he was friendly so I'm sure he'd be willing to help, nope. He ghosted me.

This is true of business, first and economy tickets I have flown in over 23 different flights. Customer service is useless and seem to always give wrong and incorrect information. Issues have ranged from damage to expensive suitcases, no food with first class tickets on the plane, rude airline staff, rude and stupid supervisors in customer service that cannot do simple math. You name it. So, I have decided never ever to fly Delta or any Sky team airlines again. This applies also to all my staff. I would rather fly a cheap low budget airline and at least get what I pay for than fly Delta. They are a complete joke.

With customer service phone-lines bogged up because of the crisis, we decided to take our chances and head to the airport a day early to see if there was any chance we could return sooner. Luckily, we were met with Dionne at the Delta Check-In (Terminal 2, at LaGuardia airport). Dionne had to deal with a faulty system that forced her to enter our passport credentials manually, but she handled it with grace and humour (which was really needed at that moment). She also did everything she could to find all the options available to us. Thankfully, she was able to get us on a flight later that day, direct to Toronto. Regardless of that, she acted as a professional, very calm and direct, and most importantly as a compassionate human to two Canadians hopped up on little sleep and lots of anxiety and uncertainty.

I am even a Delta SkyMiles member, as I had planned on being a customer of theirs for a very long time. But I am afraid to say that that trust has reached its demise after today. Today, I flew to Dallas for a business trip that included a golf outing. I was particularly excited about this golf outing, as I had just bought a brand new $300 club that I was very eager to try. However, the club did not come in the mail before I had to ship the rest of my clubs out via a 3rd party service. I immediately called Delta to see if bringing a single golf club onto the plane was possible. I was very doubtful that this would be allowed, but I thought it would be worth making a phone call just to make sure. When I called Delta’s baggage support line, the man who answered the phone told me in complete confidence that it would not be an issue. I even made sure to ask if I would have any trouble getting it through security. He assured me that it would be fine and that I could store the club in the planes closet or just hold it with me in my seat. This information made me very happy and reinforced the high quality of service and excellence that I believed Delta Airlines provided to all their passengers. When I arrived at the airport, I went to check in a bag. While I was at the counter, 3 women were standing there as one of them was checking in my bag. Not one of them noticed the golf club I was carrying and recommended that I checked it in. But why would they? They were probably just as clueless of the rules and regulations as the man I spoke with on the phone. I got to the front of security with 30 minutes until my flight was supposed to leave when one of the officers told me that I was not allowed to bring my club through. I assured him that I spoke with Delta and they said it was ok. It turns out that all sporting equipment must be checked in, no matter how small it may be. I sprinted back to the check in desk to try and check the club in, but it was too late to do so. I even tried to go store it, but the crew was switching shifts and would not be open for another 15 minutes. I did not have 15 minutes. Long story short, I was forced to throw away a brand new $300 golf club because of the false information that I was provided by Deltas clueless support team and the lack of awareness of their check-in team.

"""no empathy, no compassion""",2,2020-02-11,"I had a flight from Cancun to Pittsburgh connecting through Atlanta yesterday. On my first flight, a cup of coffee was spilled on my lap after the passenger sitting next to me was bumped by the flight attendant and spilled her coffee. I accept accidents happen and I managed as best I could despite being wet and sticky. I shrugged this off and hurried to immigration/ customs. I have global entry and only had carry-on luggage and saw that there was a 2 hour earlier flight on Delta (15699) that would allow me to get home sooner, out of my sticky clothes and permit me to surprise my 8 year old son by getting to his swim competition in time. From online, it appeared there were over 20 seats open in the main cabin. I stopped at the delta baggage desk right after Customs and asked if this was possible and they said yes but that I had to run up to the gate since it was already boarding. I did just that- I ran! I got myself from the F concourse to the B concourse, Gate 5 and the area was clear, the gate was open for another 5 minutes and was staffed by an agent. I had to rest for 30 seconds just to catch my breath. I explained the agent what the Delta agents had told me to do. His response- was flat and dismissive ""Are you a Delta Platinum member?"" ""Are you A Delta Gold Member?"" I said no to both queries. His next response ""Well then you will have to pay $75 for a ticket change."" I explained that the representatives had indicated this would not be a problem as there were so many seats open- I was already travelling on Delta and normally this flight would not be available to me book as the time between flights is too small to be permitted to book during the initial reservation. I explained how my clothes were now sticky as a result of the coffee being spilled on me. I explained about my 8 year old and wanting to get home. None of this mattered. I was nobody to the agent. My impression after this - Delta only cares about you if you are a Platinum or Gold member. (Ironically I had considered, an hour earlier while in flight, applying for the platinum card as my husband sits on the American Board of Plastic Surgeons and flies often for board meetings. Suffice to say- I will stick with my existing airline credit cards and skip Delta's card as I do not see myself electively travelling on Delta in the future). I begged the agent to call a supervisor - he did but he dawdled and the gate was just 2 minutes from closing. I watched painfully as the door closed and the plane took off and the agent didn't care. There was no empathy, no compassion. Nothing.  I couldn't believe that this Delta agent would let me stand there, bag in hand, knowing he could have been kind and allowed me to see my family earlier, see my son compete and offset my unfortunate 'coffee in the lap' experience. I couldn't believe that he let me sit there knowing how many seats were empty on that flight just to make a point -pay the $75 or wait without reason. The irony is that my scheduled delta flight, 2 hours later, was so full that they had customers waiting in standby. That agent could have freed up my seat if he had let me get on the earlier flight.

As we sat there and eventually watched other passengers board, we finished our meal and headed back over to the gate. When we got there they informed us they had given our seats away. No intercom, no warning, nothing -- just oversold and a whole bunch of people trying to get to their families in time for Christmas. So they bumped us. The next two flights were also oversold and so we had to buy two new tickets to get home late that night. It took us 9 extra hours to get home and had to fly through Seattle instead of on the direct flight we had seats for. We got to SLC late and many passengers were trying to get to connecting flights. One woman, in particular, had a young sleepy girl and was carrying large bags. She had only a few minutes to get to her gate and was going to miss her flight. We picked up her bags and sprinted no less than a half mile to the other terminal and caught them as they were closing the doors. We told her a woman was coming with her baby and to please hold the flight. It was an honor to get this poor woman and her child on her flight and we saved Delta from her missing her plane on Christmas Eve. That would have been 100% their fault. Now - I just spent 2 hours on the phone hoping Delta would show us a courtsey of some kind of credit for having to spend an extra $750 on new tickets to get home. Their customer service talked over me, did not employ good English, was disrespectful and told me it was all my fault. Even if that's true - why would you not do all you can to save a customer or to take care of a customer who has been so loyal? Why be just like so many other airlines? Delta has become too big and is losing what made them special. I can't believe I'm saying this - but I will choose them last from here on out.

It still has some serious problems with the overhead bins being tiny; the pilot and flight attendants entreated us 5 or so separate times to NOT put your small backpack and jacket in the bins, but to place them on the ground to make space for roller bags. I should not be punished for packing light and only having a small backpack, and I refuse to put the blazer i will be wearing the following day in an interview on the ground.

Sat in Comfort+ and the seats were reasonably comfortable with plenty of leg room. We were delayed getting off the ground due to an Air Traffic Control slow down (during the nationwide strikes on December 6th) but the flight crew kept us informed. We had to take a bus to a remote stand so boarding was somewhat slow and disjointed. That was not announced in advance but became obvious when there was no Delta aircraft at the gate. Once on board, the service was excellent. This was our third international trip on Delta this year and the cabin crews are significantly better than most airlines I have flown recently (with the possible exception of some of the Asian airlines). After take off the crew gave out water bottles and amenity kits then followed that with a welcome on board drink. Then meal service with three options (outlined on the printed menu and flight schedule which had been handed out at the start of the flight). During the flight the flight attendants came through four times offering water or juice and I also saw the flight attendants bring drinks to those who requested them.

He also kindly reassured me that everything would be fine and I would be able to get home. I was the last one to board the plane and it departed right away. I am so thankful that they waited for me and that they were so kind as to not charge me again.

When there was damages found on the bags, the ground agents denied liabilities and accuse the fault was on passengers. The same was true to other passengers who experienced the same problem on the same flight when in Singapore from the US via Tokyo. After filing complaint to the customer service, the customer service took more than 14 days to reply (when in their auto reply email stated they would reply within 14 days) and the customer service would defend their mistakes and continue laying blame on the passengers. I have been their top level frequent fliers but I never felt I was treated like one at all. They don't offer any preferential check in, retrieval of luggage bags above their usual sky priority which a simple comfort + would earn the similar treatment while being the top frequent fliers on other alliance group or airlines would have offered 1st class service than Delta offering merely the same like comfort +. Service recovery is bad. The staff are not trained or geared towards high value customers at all. Having a Porsche for tight connection is nothing premium when other airlines offer direct boarding from lounge like Emirates or complimentary limousine airport transfers such as from JL, MH and so on. They appear to prefer paid business class passengers but their products and services completely do NOT match up to any full service airlines that have business class product. Their lounge is always filled with so many people and refreshment are really just plain refreshment (basic snacks NOT food) and very often, their lounges do NOT even have shower facilities. So don't even count on having complimentary spa/massage/sleeping area etc. Their planes are dirty and old yet the ticket fares are expensive. Amenities frequently not working for example IFE doesn't work, USB not charging, food stuck in between seats, chewing gums found in aircraft safety menu, dirty toilets, broken window shades and Delta has a policy where instead of bumping revenue passengers to higher classes when seats are needed, they would instead bump their non revenue employees or families/kins onto business class seats especially on international route. Their complimentary first class upgrade almost hardly happen to any members as it will always be full. Delta will always try not to offer the upgrade until at boarding and by which time, all the first class seats would be taken up already. So don't be fooled by the benefits stated on their website for their frequent fliers programme. Their hidden clause to defend their misrepresentation would be ""whenever available"". To Delta, available for revenue tickets doesn't mean available for upgrade. There is absolutely no incentives being their frequent fliers especially for international travellers. They are just a commuter airline within US or regional at best. So Delta best if ever rated best is best within the US only. In one word to describe Delta and by International Standard, avoid  it.

"never put your faith in this company""",2,2019-10-10,"Portland to Bloomington via Atlanta. My flight landed at 830pm at ATL so I could hit a connecting flight at 9:07. We weren't able to unload because another plane was at the gate we were suppose to pull into. Instead of pulling into a different gate, we sat there for 20 minutes. We finally got to a gate and it wasn't until 9PM that the first person was able to get off the flight. They promised that nobody would miss their connecting flights. Turns out they did not do anything to prevent this. My flight to BMI took off at 9:02PM (suppose to be 9:07PM). I got to the gate at 9:09PM with no plane in sight. There were countless other people who had missed flights due to this airline. The best part was it was a gorgeous day out so it was really just their lack of commitment, maintenance, and planning by the airport. I wish I could create a work environment where I just have to say, ""I'm sorry for not being able to achieve what I said would happen but here are the reasons"". I ended up sleeping at the airport as I imagined I'd get less than 8 hours of sleep if I went to their ""discounted"" hotel (not free), go through security at a big airport, and weave my way around of a mass amount of people to get to my gate. Summary is I missed my grandma's funereal because a company can't uphold it's scheduling. The good news is they got me there eventually, got me a ticket to the next flight, and I was able to see my family. Please never put your faith in this company. Always make sure there's another flight after and if there is, understand that you still might not get onto that flight because it was all already booked.

Our flight returning home from Hawaii was delayed 5 hours by the time we took off. It didn’t leave until after 2am when all was said and done. We had no where to go as everything closes early in Kauai, extra expenses related to rental car late return, had more expenses due to staying longer (food), had to try to make arrangements for kids that were supposed to be dropped off at our house by a certain time, and most importantly wasted my time and caused a lot of unneeded stress. I think of experiences I have had with companies in the past and this one far surpasses any negative experience I have had in the past. I called when we realized it was delayed, which was further delayed once more. I got a CS person that really was not helpful at all. They offered $100 for my troubles. I asked for a manager and he told me that is all they could do. Got the manager and she mentioned they might be able to do a bit more and never recorded the call or offer.

Unfortunately, they were one of two airlines flying from there. Everything was going well and I purchased my ticket with a ""24 Hour Refund Guarantee."" What is very misleading about this is that the airline does not specify which 24 hours these are. You can only get a refund within 24 hours of purchasing the ticket, not before the flight takes place. So with this assumption that the flight could be canceled and refunded as long as there was a 24 hour in advance notice, I booked the ticket.

I then tried to call and get my refund, only to be informed that there is a $200 fee for canceling my flight, and I would only get back what the ticket was worth minus that, a whopping $18 (which can only be used towards another flight). This is at two-plus months away from the flight, there is plenty of time for them to find a replacement for my seat. After sitting on hold for thirty minutes waiting for a representative, I was once again told there would be no refund, so I asked them to reinstate my ticket. There was no way I was going to allow this company to get double the profit off of my seat, I'd rather it stay empty. I then asked them if the ticket could be transferred to another person, so I could get someone to purchase the ticket from me. The answer is no.

"""unable to make our departure flight""",2,2019-08-26,"Denver to Detroit. Our friends always told us we needed to try the nicer airlines out, but we generally couldn’t afford it so we were excited when we found that Delta had a basic economy flight available for a trip home to visit my family. We though “Finally! We get to fly with an airline that treats their customers well!” Boy were we in for a surprise. I guess you only qualify for Deltas better treatment if you have the money to fly in one of their other classes. Just like everything else in this world, it seems Delta has subscribed to the idea that if you don’t have money, you are worthless and don’t deserve to be treated well. Through a course of events, my husband and I were unable to make our departure flight. When we realized we would not make our flight, I called to discuss what could be done. A Delta representative informed me that because I was a basic economy customer, they could not assist me over the phone, so when we arrived at the airport, we spoke with someone at the counter. The representative we spoke with was very condescending and entirely unhelpful. After scolding us for missing our original flight, they informed us that we would need to rebook and that the cost would be over $300 per passenger. Nowhere in that conversation did they indicate that we would need to rebook our entire trip. Not wanting to spend $600+ on top of what we had already spent, we booked a one-way trip with our usual economy airline. We thought our troubles were over. Sure, we were out a couple hundred dollars, but we made it to family vacation and we had a flight home .. or so we thought... We spent a great week with my family and returned to the airport for our flight back home only to find that our entire reservation had been canceled when we missed our first flight. The individual at the desk this time got on the phone to try to sort things out with us. They found that we would be expected to buy new tickets for a flight home. Again it was suggested that we pay over $300 per passenger to secure our flights home. The individual helping me at the desk held my hand and assured me they understood how I was feeling, but they couldn’t convince the person on the other side of the phone to help us. Eventually, the person on the other end of the phone conceded to crediting is with the cost of our original flights home so that we would pay the difference instead of the full charge to rebook. As if this was some sort of favor... we eventually concede to pay out of desperation to get home for work the next day. All in all, we essentially paid for our entire trip twice. Though the hit to my bank account was painful, the biggest sting wasn’t ultimately the cost; it was the loud and proud message that I only mattered to Delta as a customer if I had been willing to pay more money to them on the front end. Well Delta, you win. You have my money, but certainly not my respect, and surely not my business.

And not a few thousand, 100s of thousands! Which brings me to my issue. My fiancé is from Brazil. She comes from a big family with great tradition of family events and putting family first. Her parents are celebrating 50 years of marriage. We can not miss that event. I’ve been working on a trip to take advantage of my rewards from decades of travel. It occurred to me, that if I am to leave my native city (Atlanta) to Sau Paulo. The cost for us to leave Atlanta is outrageous. The points cost us more than double compared to other airports in the vicinity. We’re trying to work through it and be creative but it is a huge waste of time and energy. Not only in trying to source the trip and solve the problem, but also in having to fly to another airport just to preserve my hard earned points. And this email is just another big waste of my time. To make matters worse you’re having us leave an airport (Miami) we don’t even want to depart from, only to come back to Atlanta and do a 10 hour layover.

Though we’ve never flew with Delta airlines before, there were no worries that our honeymoon would be amazing. When we arrived to the Delta check – in , there was an older gentlemen who was kind enough to help get our luggage checked in, he stated that he had just sent us off to Aruba and that some sort of gratuity would be in order, we tipped him and went on our way.

Although boarding to ATL was passed time, the flight made good timing. We arrived in ATL at 9:50 am instead of 9:31am like our boarding passes and check in stated. My husband and I had assigned seats in the back of the plane, separately in rows 35 B and 35 F. It took a total of 20 minutes to get off the Delta flight 1080 from STL. We got off from our flight around 10:10 am, unlike other airlines we have been on, Delta requires you to go see a monitor for further instructions on boarding.

But this is a serious customer service issue. Other airlines still allow you to fly standby on earlier flights for free. Delta decided to be greedy and monetize this. It takes them very little effort and probably makes them more money in the long run to allow standby passengers for free. It make sure the flights are full and provides the airline better flexibility in later flights to change and add passengers. But, Delta decided to go to the dark side on this one, forgo good will to their customers and make that extra $75. I personally will make sure to fly United or Southwest in the future if I have the reasonable option. I'm not swearing off Delta entirely as I care for convenience in my travel first and foremost, but I do guarantee I will purchase at least a couple fewer Delta tickets this year.

"""I will never fly Delta again""",1,2019-08-09,"Not Verified |  Portland to Washington. I hate that I’m wasting more energy on Delta, but people need to know how they treat people, their kids, and their belongings. My kids had an unaccompanied minor reservation. Anytime you make an unaccompanied minor’s reservation, you have to do it over the phone. So when I got to the airport an hour and a half before my kids flight, Delta proceeded to tell me that they could not go through TSA because they had to be two hours early. I begin to explain to them that no one informed me of this very strict rule, and that I had no way of knowing that. They were condescending towards me and said it wasn’t their job to tell me when to be at the airport, and I could read it in the “contract I signed”. I informed them that I clearly haven’t signed anything, because it’s an airline requirement that I book over the phone. I asked if they could get a flight for them that same day, but they could not due to flight times. So I then asked if they could compensate us in someway for the inconvenience because I had to work a double the next day and they said no and I got upset and began to panic because I didn’t know what to do (I have severe anxiety), and she immediately got fed up with me and told me that she would not help me and that she would just document that I got there late (which is a lie). She then told me that I needed to call the unaccompanied minors hotline to change my kids flight if I wanted any help at all. I then called the hotline, and that person helped, and was apologetic. So because of this, I had to wake up at 4:30 a.m to get them to the airport on time and then go straight to work to work a double. But when we got to the airport the next day, and we were checking my daughters suitcase at the desk, the delta employee put her bag on the belt without  tagging it first! I look at her like... is my kids bag going to get lost? She assured me it would arrive to their destination. I didn’t believe them but I wasn’t going to waste time asking for management after the way I’d been treated before. So we finally get to the gate, and when they go to board the delta employee snaps at the parents to say their goodbyes and was just very stern in general, and when I was hugging my kids goodbye she snapped at me and said “you need to stay back” I just looked at her like “I’m just trying to hug them goodbye” and even another mom came up to me and said “they have no sympathy for moms with anxiety, do they?” And if only she knew the half of it. You’d think this review stops here, but it doesn’t. Hours after I send my kids off with these unprofessional people, which I wish I hadn’t, I get a text from my son saying that there was a problem with the gate, and that they got there late and we’re at a completely different airport. Mind you, I am paying a couple hundred dollars for someone to escort them to their gate on time, And to make sure they get to the correct destination and airport.

"""luggage was missing from her flight""",1,2019-07-07,"Not Verified |  New York to Paris. I purchased three tickets for my mother and my daughters to travel to Paris together for the month of July since I was already in the city for my Master's program. My children checked-in with my brother who was going to Paris for the week since they arrived at the same time. When my mother arrived at check-in, she wasn't able to because the Delta agents in New York had put her name on my brother's luggage. My brother and daughters checked in around 6:30 PM and my mother didn't get to the airport until almost 8:00 PM to check-in for the same flight. The only thing they have in common is the same last name. The solution proposed by Delta was that she pay $100 to check-in her 1 bag as a second piece of luggage or have my brother come back out from the terminal so they could ""try to fix it"". Once you go through security, you can't come back out to the check-in counter. How do you ask someone to pay extra for your own incompetence and negligence? When you issue a baggage label you are looking at the passport, the boarding pass and the person in front of you. That's an extra level of incompetence on the part of Delta which makes me question their level of security. After their mistake, they gave my mother the run-around for over 30-minutes, then they told her that she wasn't able to check-in anymore because check-in stops one hour before boarding. There were a ton of agents just hanging around at the counters and no other customers. While they are saying this, my children and brother are texting me that the flight has been delayed and they are waiting at the terminal for an update. Then, Delta proposed that the only thing she could do was either re-book with them for a different flight on a different day and she would have to pay for the re-booking. Then they stated that they couldn't do anything because the ticket was purchased with a travel agency. After speaking to different Delta representatives and supervisors, through some ""miracle"", one of them rebooked her for a direct flight with Air France. She arrived in Paris 8 hours before my children and brother which was a major inconvenience. When all was done, my mother's luggage was missing from her flight with Air France as well as my brothers' from his flight. My children' pieces of luggage arrived one after the other on the conveyer belt. It's suspect that the two pieces of luggage missing happen to be the ones with my mother's name on them. So far, my brother's luggage was delivered the day after they arrived, but my mothers' has not yet been delivered. As of today July 6th (4 days after arrival), we were informed by Air France that they never received a marked bag for her from Delta and that her luggage is likely still in New York. They think that the baggage tag was ""probably removed"" from the suitcase which is why it never made it on the next direct flight. She's suffering from severe chronic asthma and diabetes because her extra medication was in her luggage. Now we're in Paris, she struggled to get around the past few days and had to be taken to the emergency room by ambulance today.

"""was absolutely horrific""",1,2019-06-26,"My experience with Delta Airlines was absolutely horrific and will be something I remember from my most recent trip for the rest of my life. My flight schedule was as follows, DFW->DTW->ORD (with Delta) -> BCN (Norwegian) My flight out of DFW was scheduled to depart to DTW at 7:15 AM. Due to ""technical difficulties,"" we sat boarded for two hours in the terminal. Finally, the airline crew then decided to restart the plane -literally turned it off, and turned it back on- and the issue resolved itself. This was not reassuring, as the pilot seemed to have a legitimate safety concern with the plane. It was also frustrating that it took them two hours to come to this solution. It goes without saying, I missed my connection from DTW to ORD due to this delay. The next flight out of DTW to ORD was at 3:55 which made it extremely close to missing the check-in deadline for my international flight with Norwegian at 6:30. Nevertheless, I was determined to make it work, so I got in the Delta Customer Service queue to make the arrangements. To preface this, the woman behind me in line had the exact same flight itinerary as me, so we were in the same dispositions. When I reached the counter they told me that there were no available seats at this time and that I would have to fly standby for the 3:55 flight and gave me a ticket for the 5:07 flight out of DTW - which would most definitely make me miss my international flight. I pleaded, nearly in tears, for her to do anything to help me as my flight with Norwegian was non-refundable. Unempathetically, she explained there was nothing she could do. After the line, I went to the restroom to catch my breath and met back up with the lady behind me to see what she was going to do. To my disgust and surprise, the same staff gave her a flight on the 3:55 PM seconds after she told me there was nothing she could do.  After I heard this, I got back in line and she conveniently found me a spot on the 3:55 PM flight. Once again, the flight was delayed for various reasons- one time they said technical and the other was the weather. I approached a different help desk, as now I 100% was going to miss my flight, and I was serviced by a different Delta employee (I did not catch her name but I wish I did). She proceeded to yell at me to the point I had to ask her to, ""Please, stop yelling at me."" She responded in a yelling voice, ""I am not yelling at you, just give me your ticket!"" This reduced me to tears of frustration and humiliation. When I boarded the plane, which was a full flight, I was looking for a space to put my carry-on in an overhead bin. The flight attendant, quite rudely said, ""Can you not see that these are closed? It means they are full."" Rather than offering help to a visibly upset individual she made me feel stupid and unwelcome.

"""exhausting difficult flight experience""",2,2019-04-28,"Not Verified |  What a nightmare! Wish I would have read the reviews prior to my flight because from what I've read my experience appears to be the norm. I would have saved myself from an exhausting and difficult flight experience. This was the worst flight experience by far and I've come to the conclusion from reading the other reviews and my personal experience that customer fairness and customer satisfaction just isn't a priority for Delta Airlines. Had a flight from Baltimore to Boston with a layover in New York. There was severe weather and understandably there were delays. First flight was delayed, 56 mins, 1.5 hours, 5 hours to being cancelled and then diverted to Atlanta instead of New York. I had booked a day in advance for possible problems because I had a special event that I needed to attend the following day, with that being said I was traveling with two other relatives and they split us up by putting me on a flight that departed the same day (late night) which ended up being delayed. The little light in this is the Boarding Agent, she was very helpful in getting my 2 family members on the same flight and had to work alone in resolving multiple ticket issues because Delta had changed peoples flights without their knowledge. Thought we were good, but it gets better, we get off this flight and make it to the gate of the connecting flight and the agent was nowhere to be found. We can see our connecting flight, the agent finally comes to the front and we watch the plane taxiing back and he says ""that plane was boarded 7 minutes ago the doors are closed. They knew you were coming."" So if they knew we were coming on a delayed flight by minutes why were they allowed to leave? He wasn't concerned about our dilemma in the least bit. At this point it was 10:49pm after starting this nightmare at 1:30pm. I asked him to direct us to front reservations. The only other glimmer of light was the Reservation Agent who could only give us a next morning flight, by giving us a hotel voucher because I wasn't trying to spend the night in the airport. Collateral damage seems to be a part of Delta's protocol. It is my intention to never fly this airline again.

"""extremely unprofessional and rude""",1,2019-04-26,"I booked a flight with Delta to leave on 4/19/19 at 9 am, from Chicago to Phoenix. It was a connecting flight with a 30 minute layover in Detroit. Before getting on the plane, I informed the flight attendant of my short layover. I also found out 9 other passengers were going to Phoenix too. I asked politely if she could make an announcement at the end of the flight, so all 10 of us can get up before everyone else stands up.Her response “You better run”! During the duration of the flight, I asked multiple times if they can make the announcement, which they didn’t! Once we landed, we were waiting for about 10 minutes until we got off the plane because of Deltas incompetent flight attendants! Our flight arrived at gate 22 and our flight to Phoenix was departing from gate 74! I and 9 other passengers ran 50 gates down. Once we got to the gate, our plane was still there. I might mention they were still finishing up putting the luggage in. Flight attendant at the desk was there to inform us that they won’t open the door for us, even though they knew we were coming. All of us just stood there out of breath and watched our plane leave. Without being apologetic, she told us the next flight departs at 4:20pm. She was very informed though and mentioned to us that they were having problems due to weather conditions in the east coast. And Delta I must applaud you for how accurate your flight attendants are! Just like she warned us, our flight got delayed to 5:30, 6:30, 7:30 and then 8:30! All 10 of us ended up leaving Detroit at 8:50 and getting to Phoenix at 10:30! If it wasn’t for the flight attendants on the plane, all 10 of us would make it on time and be in Phoenix at 1pm! That 10 minutes (if the flight attendant would just make an announcement) when we were waiting for everyone to get off the plane, would’ve saved us from being stranded at the airport for 8 hours! I guess an announcement is way too much to ask Delta! Our plane left with 10 seats empty when they knew all other flights were getting cancelled. Some passengers from our flight got vouchers and some didn’t! I went to talk to someone at the Deltas help desk and got a privilege of once again speaking to another Deltas courteous flight attendant. She informed me and I’m quoting “you don’t deserve a voucher because it was your fault you didn’t make the flight,” You should’ve ran faster”. Ive asked to speak to the manager and she replied “good luck”. She also refused to give me any badge number, last name and refused to call the manager! After asking random flight attendants at the airport, I finally spoke to a supervisor and someone else that was above him. Both of them told me that I should call Delta. The only problem is that days after I still never got a call back! Delta, how are you allowed to sell connecting flights with 30 min layover when they’re 50 gates apart! Yes, I’ve heard from again very professional Delta flight attendants that I was the one who booked the flight. The problem is, you don’t inform anyone that you have to run 50 gates down while we re booking it. And you definitely don’t inform your costumers of flight attendants that instead of helping passengers, they’re extremely unprofessional and rude!

We had checked in online the night before and just had one suitcase to check but due to the parking debacle we were told it was now too late to check in and we were sent to the Delta special services desk. We waited in line there and were eventually told that she couldn’t help us either, that it was too late to check in and since we had booked thru Expedia we were told we had to call them. We found chairs at the entrance to the airport and started calling to see if we could get bumped to the next flight. After time spent on hold, Expedia told us we had to call Aeromexico, which we did but were told that their computers were down and so they would have to call us back. We were continuing to make calls to see if anyone at Delta, Expedia or Aeromexico could help when someone I knew entered the airport thru the entrance we were seated at. We came up with a ‘Hail Mary’ idea of consolidating our luggage into our carry-ons and sent our one big (now empty) suitcase home with her husband, who had just dropped her off at the airport. This allowed us to race thru security (having to dump a couple items we had neglected to remove in the haste of re-packing) and ran thru the airport to our gate, only to have missed the boarding cut-off by 10 minutes. We were sent to the Delta customer service desk and she too said she couldn’t help us because we had booked thru Expedia. So we spent the next three hours on the phone attempting to get on either the next flight out or the same flight the following day. Initially Aeromexico told us that they could rebook us and that we would have to pay an extra $215 per ticket, but no one at Aeromexico seemed capable of completing that task. While my husband was on the phone with them, I was on the phone with Expedia and eventually was connected with a manager who tried to help by speaking with Aeromexico. In the two hours we were on the phone the news kept getting worse. In the end, Aeromexico refused to rebook our flights because even though we called them before we had officially missed the flight, they said that since we “no-showed” they had since forfeited our return flights (which were actually thru Delta) and now, hours later, if they rebooked our flight to Mexico, there weren’t any available flights to get us home. To add insult to injury, they refused to refund any of our $2900 for the flights that they had refused to re-book and wouldn’t give any vouchers or credit for future travel either. Since we were canceling so late, we also had to pay for two of the three hotel nights too. I would not recommend flying with Aeromexico but I’m also disappointed in the service (or lack there of) provided by Delta.

Also the ear plugs do not do what they should do. I have not tested the headphones as they have no ANC in economy so i used my own. The food on Comfort plus was exactly the same like standard economy so not worth spending additional money on Comfort.. I still give 5 out of 10 as the rest was okay.

"""treat passengers with contempt""",1,2019-01-06,"New York JFK to London. Delta Air Lines are supposed to be an American flag carrier, and they promote their Delta One business class product as a premier class. First, the Delta Lounge at JFK is nothing short of disgusting. The lounge itself is shabby, and the queue to the bar was massive. Upon finally getting to the bar, the staff try to charge you for the drinks. The food, (help yourself), is truly of such poor quality you would not feed to your dog. Served on paper bowls, from school meal-esque vats, of some kind of watery curry on boiled rice. The flight itself was dreadful, onboard some ancient, Airbus 330-200, presumably inherited from USAir. Terrible crew, who merely served the meal as quickly as possible, and then disappeared to the galley. The meal, per se, was ghastly. I have flown American Airlines, British Airways, and Virgin Atlantic trans-Atlantic, and Delta Airlines set the new low standard; not Business Class, but no class whatsoever.

Delta Air Lines customer review,1,2019-01-06,"London to Salt Lake City. I had not flown Delta for over 20 years, and only did so due to the Virgin Atlantic code share. I was intrigued to try their much vaunted Delta One business class. The aircraft was an old B-767-300, which was in awful shape. The so-called business class was atrocious, and must be at least 20 years out of date. I thought British Airways Club Class was bad, but this was worse. The food onboard was inedible, and the wine selection poor. The ONLY good thing about Delta Airlines, was the use of the Virgin Atlantic Upper Class lounge at Heathrow. Other than that, there was nothing to commend about this flight, or indeed this airline.

"""Delta is the worst""",1,2019-01-04,"Pittsburgh to Atlanta via Key West. I have had a terrible experience flying with this airline. I have traveled all over and Delta is the worst! Where do I start? Purchased tickets with customer service by phone asked for 2 seats right beside each other and specifically asked how many pieces of luggage each passenger can check in? The sales agent responded 2 bags each for first class! The next day we went to the Delta counter to board our flight and the counter agent only said that we were aloud 1 bag to Key West. Had to leave a piece of luggage the airport! Boarded the plane to find out that our seats were not together! Landed at Atlanta airport to eventually find out that our connecting flight was cancelled! Had to get a taxi to a hotel that was discounted and not paid and only having the clothes that we were wearing and nothing else! We left at 3:00am to catch our flight for 5:30am! The Delta agents advised us that we will not receive new boarding passes and that we will have to use our existing boarding passes from the day before, needless to say I had a terrible experience with security because our boarding passes were for yesterday. I finally boarded the plane to find out that the piolets did not receive to necessary paperwork to fly to Key West! We waited 1 hour for someone to hand deliver the paperwork while on the runway. Finally landed in Key West to find out that my luggage and clothing was soaked! Still having issues with baggage claims. They rejected my claim stating that the verbal claim was put in Dec 2nd 2018 when I purchased my tickets December 19th and actually did not land in Key West till Dec 21st when I called about my luggage.

"""Air steward conduct was mixed""",5,2019-01-03,"Guatemala to Baltimore Washington via Atlanta. Check in staff at all airports were excellent, professional and helpful (including Dulles where we started from). Boarding was done in an organized way. We bought our tickets online and it was not clear that we had to pay extra for each bag. Two flights (Dulles to Atlanta and Atlanta to Guatemala just before Christmas) were seriously overbooked and that contributed to significant delays. Air steward conduct was mixed. On the way there, all the stewards were friendly and courteous. On the way back from Guatemala city, the male steward in economy was grumpy and unhelpful. The final straw was near and of flight when he trapped me in a by now dirty bathroom with urine on floor by not moving his beverage-snacks cart and continuing to unload his trays. When he continued unloading, I insisted he move his cart and let me out. Customers should not have to demand to be allowed out of dirty bathrooms. There was no apology. The other airline stewards were not polite or friendly when we disembarked at Atlanta. One Asian stewardess was kind to our daughter though and gave her extra cookies as she was hungry. However, on the next flight from Atlanta to Baltimore all the stewards in both first class and economy were very gracious to economy passengers as well. Food was terrible on all flights. I have never experienced international flights with such poor food options (poor quality cookies and snacks). We could only buy a box of decent snacks on one flight. Food options definitely need to be vastly improved especially on international flights.

"""Service is very low standard""",1,2019-01-03,"We booked a Virgin Premium Economy Flight from Los Angles to Sydney. When we boarded to our surprise it was a Delta Air Lines Plane and we were given seating grade equivalent to Virgin`s Economy X. Not what we paid for. The Service is very low standard compered to Virgin`s Premium Economy. Firstly the pillow had dirty marks and hair all over it, but they were able to find me a clean one. The seats are narrower than Virgin`s Premium Economy. The hostess admitted she did not know the difference between the food packages and was handing out different ones to what passengers asked for. She rips them open to see & check if she got the right one. I got a ripped open one, no bother complaining. The bread rolls they brought around were literally rock cakes. Coffee served was cold and to get anything extra to drink was very difficult. When the hostess finally brought some water around she split it over me.  Every seat is supposed to have a travel pack and mine missed out, no big deal but just part of the low grade service and care. The pocket that holds the instructions etc, still had the previous passengers rubbish. No Do Not Wake Signs as other Airlines have, so when you take off at 10.45 pm you do not really want to be disturbed 4-5 hours later, but Delta does. I suggest Delta Airlines stick to domestic travel in USA & Canada what they do good at, But with International Travel their service including Staff, Seating, Passenger Comforts, Quality of Food is flat out getting 1 Star.

"""disdain and arrogance""",1,2019-01-02,"Flew Delta Comfort+ from Springfield to Greenville via Atlanta. Flight delayed in Springfield 7 times. First explanation was a weather issue then changed to a maintenance issue then to a crew timed out issue at which point it became obvious it was nothing more than a lying issue. Connecting flight in Atlanta leaves on time at 10:29 pm, unfortunately we do not arrive until 11:30 pm. Directed to 3 different agent locations then to Baggage Claim area. Approximately 150 people standing in line at midnight after being stranded by Delta. After 2 hrs of standing we are close enough to make out the Delta employee stating that Delta will rebook your flight and nothing more. Someone asked about overnight accommodations and was told there were plenty of chairs in the terminal. Another person asked for a meal voucher and was told Delta does not provide meal vouchers. It was suggested that if anyone got a hotel room they could try to apply for up to $100 in reimbursement after the first of the year. After watching the Delta agents treatment of the customers in front of them and twice hearing an agent tell a customer they did not like their attitude and would have them arrested we exited the line. I am not adept at kissing someone's butt while they treat me like an animal and it had become apparent that Delta's agents were fully aware that passengers have no legal recourse against Delta and they did not hesitate to pass that along with a heaping serving of disdain and arrogance. During this fine example of ""Special Services"" Delta continued to be consistent with the emails telling me how sorry they were for the delay and how they care about their customers. New flight leaving 8:55 am next day. Delayed twice because the Flight attendants were reported by the gate attendant at 8:45 am as being in the airport but did not show up at the gate until after 9:30.
