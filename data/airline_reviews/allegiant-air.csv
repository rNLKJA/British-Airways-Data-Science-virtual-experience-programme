"""There is really no one you can talk to""",1,2022-03-24,"I had booked my brothers a flight from Nashville to McAllen on 2/25/22 for travel dates 3/24-3/27/22. While I was booking the flight the website kept glitching and trying to refresh. I finally got their tickets booked. So yesterday on 3/23/22 I pull up their itinerary to check them in and print their boarding passes, I get an error message saying it is not within the 24 hour time frame to check in. So, I immediately look at the departure date and time and realized that the departure date was incorrect. I then checked the return date and it was the same exact day 3/27/22. So the flight ""I supposedly booked"" was supposed to depart at 8.52am to land in McAllen at 10.55am then to get off that plane and board the next plane since it departs at 11.38am and come right back home. I tried to modify the flight to correct it. They were wanting to charge me $652 to change the date. I looked up the correct flight and realized that there were not many passengers on that flight. I called the (702) 505-8888 and waited for 5 hours and 25 minutes with no response. My phone died. I ended driving to the airport and of course there was not anyone at the desk. I sat down and tried the ""chat with a live agent"" option before leaving the airport. The website told me it would be a 25 minute wait. I waited for those 25 minutes and more and I got a ""Null Response"" whatever that meant and the screen never changed. So at this point the only chance I had to modify the itinerary was to go to the airport the morning of. We show up this morning, I immediately politely ask to speak to a manager. They said it was only a supervisor present. I explained the situation and told her I would mind to pay the difference of the tickets of what they cost today. The whole trip came out to be $338 for 4 passengers. The ""supervisor"" stated that she could not make any changes on her computer, that she would have to call CS. She then reiterated everything I told her. She said to make the changes they are going to charge you $780 and that's waiving the $75 modification fee. I told her I was not going to pay the $780. I was willing to pay half of $780. Why could not they catch the error, I booked the dates correctly. Had their system had not glitched we probably would not have this problem. The flight was empty! Less than 30 had booked that flight. I asked to speak to the guy on customer service, but they said I could not talk to him. I would have to call that 702 area code number. They came back and said the best they could do was for me to pay $554 after tax Which I ended up paying. There is really no one you can talk to.

My grandma unexpectedly passed away and my sister and I needed to fly down from Anchorage, AK to Harlingen, TX for my grandma's cremation. We bought our tickets through Kayak.com; we were supposed to leave from Anchorage and fly straight to LAX (Los Angeles, CA) with Alaska Airlines and then from LAX straight to McAllen, TX with Allegiant. We already had to worry about the hassle of getting off of our Alaska Airlines flight, getting our luggage, bringing it to the Allegiant counter to re-check the baggage, and then going back through security in LAX to get to our gate with Allegiant, and we had less than an hour to get it all done! By some miracle, the plane leaving LAX was delayed, but even with the delay and us running our butts off through the terminals we just made it to the gate .... only to find out 20 mins later that the flight was completely cancelled due to crew. Allegiant refused to give my sister and me any kind of assistance out if a situation they put is in. We were 100% stranded in LA; since this trip was last minute and sudden, we had used all of our money plus help friends to get down to TX in the first place. When the flight to McAllen was cancelled, the only thing Allegiant offered was a refund plus compensation OR a rebooking on the next flight to McAllen which wasn't until Saturday morning. Mind you, the cancelled flight was supposed to fly out at 8 AM Wednesday morning, and the next flight out was Saturday morning. There were no hotel vouchers offered to help with the two day wait time, which left my sister and me stranded in the airport. Allegiant didn't bother to help with finding any type of connecting flights. Even if you had elected the refund, there was a 5 - 10 business day wait on actually receiving the refund, so we couldn't exactly go back to the counters to buy another ticket to McAllen, which was THE only other solution Allegiant offered; which was even more money out of my pocket that I didn't have. When I asked them if there were ANY other options they could help with, all I was told was that I could elect to receive the refund and compensation OR wait for the next flight. Those were my only two options, with no other assistance at all out of the airport. They said those were my only two options: refund and compensation or wait for Saturday morning. With no where to wait. I've never had such a horrible experience flying. Ever. When we started trying to call around to see if there was any other airline that could get us out, the other airline's response was ""well at least they can go wait at the hotel while we figure this out"" and when we told them Allegiant hadn't even offered any type of hotel vouchers or anything, even THEY were shocked. Like I said, this was my first experience flying with Allegiant and it was horrible enough that I will avoid them at all costs and will tell everyone I know to do the same.

"""extremely unnerving, stressful and unsatisfactory""",1,2021-07-18,"We had an extremely unnerving, stressful and unsatisfactory experience with Allegiant. We have flown with many airlines, and when a situation arises for someone to give up their seat for monetary compensation, there is never an issue. We were to fly out July 9, from Stewart International Airport on flight 2278 to Sanford, FL. The flight was overbooked. Therefore, the gate agent started by requesting 3 volunteers to be bumped for $200 cash and a rebooked flight. No one offered including us. After a few minutes the gate agent announced the offer was now $400 and a rebooking. Again we did not offer nor did anyone else. A short time after, the gate agent announced an offer of $800 and a rebooking. This offer piqued our interest and the 3 members of our party volunteered. As we walked to the gate agent, other passengers commented to us they wish they could volunteer, but couldn’t  - comments were overheard exclaiming “$800 dollars cash, that would be nice”. We arrived to the gate agent, who we later came to know was the station manager. She was overwhelmed with the amount of people trying to get on the plane and asked us to hold tight and wait to “take care of us”. When the flight was all boarded with the gate doors closed and the plane pulling away, she commenced the process of arranging our compensation. To our shock and extreme disappointment, we soon received emails containing a link to only flight credits, and not the monetary compensation we were expecting. She simply shrugged us off and said we misunderstood her and the only option was the $200 cash or the flight credits. We insisted that she call again and tell them we were told $800 and not flight credit, however after getting off the phone, she told us take it or leave it, $200 in monetary compensation or the Flight credits, even telling us that no airline would give that much as compensation. This we know for a fact not to be true, as we have had previous experiences with other airlines (American, Delta, United, Jet blue) which have offered $400, $600 even up to $1200 for giving up a seat. At this point, apparently the state trooper was called, however we were at no time violent, not swearing, not being belligerent or yelling. We were strongly defending our position for what we and all the other passengers around the gate clearly understood was offered, $800 per passenger for the 3 seats that were needed. We insisted that the manager call again and tell the office we were not satisfied with the $200, she again stated we were wrong, and that we would never get more than the $200. We told her to call again and speak to a manager, which she finally did. The result was a $400 offer which we reluctantly accepted. There was an email that was supposed to come through, and she informed us just to leave and we would receive it within 15 minutes. Our trust in the airline had been clearly damaged, so we did not wish to leave until we received the email. She left us there telling us it would come through and that she was done. She walked away and left us with the state trooper to escort us out. This is how Allegiant repays their passengers who inconvenience themselves to allow the airline to carry on with the scheduled flight, give us less money and call the police to escort us away.

There was never any opportunity given to us to request to be seated in a row that complied with social distance guidelines.

I might remind you that New York subways had high death rates when train were crowded with passengers. There were a number of children who were crying almost the entire flight. The flight attendant did give a bottle of water to one of the infants, and that seem to calm that child down. What other measures might have been taken like giving some candy? Upon boarding your plane, we were given a package containing a mask, gloves and Sani wipes but there was no requirement to use them.

The 40lb. weight limit on bags is laughable and purely designed to get customers to pony up an additional $50 per bag for even the slightest overage. The check-in agents were rude ... one of them even caused a scene that led to the line being slowed for nearly 10 minutes. The planes are crammed with no room to place your carry-on under the seat. We were traveling with our small emotional support dog (which they charged us for despite documentation). He was in a carrier that fit the airline's prescribed parameters, but we couldn't get him far enough under the seat because of the limited space. The flight attendant told us he needed to go further under the seat, but that was impossible. We finally convinced her we couldn't get him any further under the seat without hurting him, but she didn't make it easy. The plane took forever to take off as we sat for quite sometime before we even began to taxi. All in all, it was a pretty awful experience. As one commenter mentioned, you shouldn't waste your money.

Ticket counter agents seemed to take longer to process people than other airlines. While waiting at the gate, the time became close to boarding time, but nothing happened, no announcements, etc. The time eventually even passed takeoff time with everyone still waiting to board and no announcements regarding the delay. Finally, we boarded the plane an hour after scheduled takeoff time and the captain on board the plane explained over the intercom that something happened earlier in the day to throw off the schedule and ""they hoped to make it up to us in the future"" (an odd statement, given that it is impossible to make up a time delay). So we are an hour behind our takeoff time and the ticket agent (now on board the plane) begins to call out particular passenger names to see if these people are on board. I'm wondering, wouldn't they already know who's onboard from the tickets being scanned at the gate? Then the same agent begins going down the rows, one by one, saying the first name of each passenger that is supposed to be in that seat and wanting those passengers to confirm their identity. I had never seen this before in all my years of flying (I'm 58 years old). I'm thinking, there must be an easier way! I took some Benadryl prior to the flight for allergies, hoping that it would knock me out and I would have a blissful nap en route but, lo and behold, the seats don't recline, even the slightest bit (no button on the armrests, etc.).

Well, I'm not paying $3 for a 12 cent soda! Apparently I'm not the only fussy passenger - there is a baby behind me that starts crying which inspires other babies to start crying. Unfortunately, they are healthy babies with lots of energy and they don't stop crying for most of the remainder of the flight. I'm thinking, ""Oh please, God, just let it be over soon"".

Traffic was backed up and horrendous. There was a very bad accident on the freeway, and we made it to the airport at 8:45am. The plane was to leave at 9:00am. My daughter and I had no bags to check and I was already prechecked in and ready to go. We knew it was a longshot, but we went straight to the gate just to see if I can make it.

We remained calm and went to the ticket counter to see what could be done. As time passed and the lady continued to attempt to help us, she let us know we would be charged 75 dollars as a comp fee for a flight on Saturday. We immediately felt upset and I had a panic attack. People behind us had also missed their flight and began to complain. The woman and another woman behind the counter began to become upset with those of us that missed our flight stating that we should have been there two hours prior. We asked to speak to a manager. The second woman kept saying “well many others were here on time, they were two hours early as you should have been, we can’t hold the plane for you”.  We kept saying “we know you can’t hold the plane that’s not what we’re asking we don’t understand why we have to pay again when it’s not our fault that we missed“. We explained to the lady that we did not want to compare ourselves to others that were not on the road when we were on the road that were not affected by the accident like we were affected. She appeared to have no remorse. As they began to get a manager they asked those of us that missed the flight to step aside to another side and that we would be served once he came to the counter. A family came up and got in line and it had been maybe two minutes before a gentleman came to the counter, one of the people who missed their flight was a little old woman who went up to him thinking he must be the manager. However they told her that she needed to wait her turn that those behind her were actually in line, and had been waiting an hour to check in for their flight. Although maybe their perception of an hour is different or maybe it was the stress, but those people had just gotten there and those of us that were waiting for figuration of our missed flight and the cost of a second flight since it was not our fault that we missed our plane, we had only been waiting maybe 30 minutes if not less. What seemed like an eternity during the situation was really not that long, and those of us that had missed our flight were the only ones standing in line until they moved us aside and a family came up right behind us. Overall it was a very stressful situation with customers just wanting some clarification and understanding from the company and workers of the company just not having remorse and probably feeling stressed themselves as well. Overall the manager came and comped to all the flights for free for those of us who were involved in the freeway of the accident that had occurred and we were not able to make it to the airport.

"""Everything went without a hitch""",9,2019-07-17,"I have seen a lot of negative reviews about Allegiant and I have to admit that it was with some trepidation that I decided to take a trip with them. I don't normally submit a review but I wanted to share my experience. The fee-happy structure is intimidating and your experience can be different than what you are used to on another airline. At the Airport, plan for more time at the ticket counter. Individual flights seem to have their own line. Don't get in the wrong line. Plan on more time with the ticket counter agent. If you are checking a bag or carrying on a bag, they will review this information with you. You will receive a tag for your carry on. Your carry on luggage may well be considered ""too large"" and will need to be checked. Similarly, your checked bag can only be 40 lbs (most airlines give you 50 lbs). Make sure your luggage conforms to their published dimensions and weight. What is considered carry-on size for Delta may need to be checked on Allegiant. There is a lot of homework to do or you could end up with an unpleasant surprise. What I found that WAS a very pleasant surprise is that if you are a veteran and can prove it - you can check up to 3 bags and a carry on for FREE! It is the most generous offering in the industry. There are other perks for veterans too, so check their website for a full,detailed list. The flight was on time, the flight crew was pleasant. They made it quite clear that nothing on that beverage and snack cart was free and they went through the cabin very quickly. It was easy to move around since the the carts swept through the cabin much quicker than airlines which give complimentary snacks and beverages. The chairs (I won't call them seats) were narrow, hard and did not recline. For the hour flight we had, it was fine. For the price, I did not mind at all. For my destination, they make only two flights per week. Its a little scary to think about a cancelled flight, so that is a risk you must be willing to take.

However they recently started a route that flies directly to his parents hometown so we thought how do we pass that up? I’m a nurse so the best way I can write this review and explain would be in military time. Day one 0800 - get an alert on our phone that our 0900 flight will be delayed about an hour. We were instructed to wait in the gate area. Announced that for weather reasons the flight may take off at 1000, they will keep up posted. Boarded flight and take off around 1030 to Sarasota destination. 1200 get an announcement on the plane that we are about 50min our from our destination and are beginning our descent. 1230, updated that a plane ahead of us encountered bad weather and we are being rerouted to Destin, Florida so we can refuel and then take off once the storm has passed. Water and Chex mix were passed out. Taxied around Destin on the plane until about 1340 and then are given the option to get off the plane at Destin. Three other Allegiant flights had also been detoured. The tiny Destin airport was completely overwhelmed with an hour long Quiznos line and a handful of outlets that were being guarded for dear life. 1530 got an announcement all flights to Sarasota should reboard. Boarded, watched the seatbelt demonstration etc and were taxing for about 45min assuming that we were just waiting our turn to take off. 1630 announced that our plane didn’t pass one of the maintenance checks and that they needed to have some people come out and work on the plane. 1700 from the captain “well the bad news just keeps on coming” now our crew was reaching their maximum work time and they would need to find a new crew. 1710 - deboarded for a second time. Announced overhead the flight would be leaving around 1800. 1755 - announced our flight was canceled and would be rescheduled for the following day at 0700. All chaos then ensued.

Three employees were yelling names over each other and sometimes just using first names, not very helpful.

I know that and do not expect bigger better seats - still I pay more). In all of the previous flights, prior to today, I have traveled with the same luggage that I carried on today.

They have lost many customers (myself, my family and friends) from this situation & their lack of help/response. We were at the airport & a very light snow flurry started that lasted less than 10 min. They tell us that there has to be a over ¼ of a mile visibility for the plane to land. Within a few minutes of the storm hitting we could see to the lake which is about 1 mile away. They then told us that the “plane does not have enough gas to circle while waiting for weather” They said that the plane had to fly back to Mesa (over an hr flight) to fuel up. We find this upsetting & hard to believe as the FAA has very specific rules and guidelines about how much gas a plane has to have. They should have had enough to circle & wait for the short flurry to pass. I have been on planes before that circled for 30 or more minutes before turning to go somewhere else. Even had a plane turn back around and land where we were supposed to after circling and waiting. So this is completely unacceptable! We are then told it will be a 2 hr delay (in the worst, most uncomfortable and claustrophobic airport I’ve been in) so they can go fill up the plane. This is upsetting & frustrating but we can handle a 2 hr delay. Shortly after this we are told that it would be even more delayed further into the evening causing a 10 hour delay. They said that they did not have snow removal equipment at the airport so the plane can’t come back. How does an airport in Utah not have snow removal equipment? It snows there half the year but they don’t have the equipment!! But then we see a snow plow in the parking lot.. All of this is completely uncalled for, unnecessary and ridiculous. If we had been in the Salt Lake airport we would have taken off and been in our destination on time. We had to pay for an uber to get us to and from the airport which cost us even more money. Thankfully we live within 30 min of the airport. When we got back to the airport there is another delay! The incoming plane doesn’t land until it is almost time for our flight to take off. They finally load the plane and we sit on the tarmac for an extended period of time waiting without any reason, they never told us why we weren’t taking off. Once we land we then sit on the tarmac again, once again with no explanation. When we were on the plane we were not offered anything as an apology, no free snacks or drinks from the over priced selection. Staff did not seem apologetic for the issues or problems with the flights! Our entire first day of the trip was completely gone and ruined!

This scared many people on the plane, but that's not the worst part. Many people on the plane had family members on the ground who were waiting for their arrival. We were told since our pilot couldn't land us, Allegiant instructed him to return to Sanford. Everyone was disappointed by that decision, considering there were dozens of closer airports to divert to. On our way back to Sanford, we were told we would stop in Savannah to refuel. While we were stretching our legs on the jet bridge, we were told we would attempt Concord again. A few moments later, we were told the jetbridge hit the door of the plane and we would be grounded until further notice. Remember those people sitting at the airport in Concord waiting for their loved ones? At this point, most of them finally had a chance to talk to their loved ones. While they were at the airport, Allegiant refused to give them any answers about what happened to the plane and why it didn't land. They hid from the terrified people who wondered why their loved ones' plane didn't land.

Flight attendants friendly and I appreciated their diversity in age, look, size, etc. I chose to save money by not selecting seats in advance because I knew that our kids wouldn't be seated alone. It worked out great that my husband was seated near the kids and I got a break by sitting across the aisle or, even better, two rows behind on the flight back! I thought the seats were the most comfortable I've ever experienced, and I've been flying for almost 50 years, both domestic and internationally. I must admit that I'm 5'2"", not overweight, and prefer firm straight-back chairs which probably doesn't characterize most folks, but I loved the seating. There was enough wiggle room in the seat and in front for legs/feet. The guy next to me stretched his arms behind his head and there was enough room that I didn't get elbowed in the temple. The center aisle felt really spacious to me which is funny because I know it's not that wide but there was enough room to walk with bags and not bang into armrests or passengers knees. Customer service before the flight was totally lacking. Tried calling in July and no one ever answered. Emailed instead on July 20 and got a reply 3 weeks later on Aug 8 which said my concern about rental car timing was handled, only to find out the day before our trip that it wasn't fixed.

Finally, at around 5 pm we boarded the flight. Once loaded, the flight attendants and gate agents came through the plane at least 7 times by could not agree on a passenger count.

But this last trip took the cake and apart from returning home on my existing ticket, I will never, ever fly Allegiant again.

The problem was the plane coming to Fort Lauderdale (FTL) had equipment problems. The fact that the waiting area was clogged with folks on an earlier (10:30) flight one lady said, was a bad sign. Then we got an announcement they were sending a ""rescue plane"", yay, but it was smaller and they needed 4 volunteers and we had to get new seat assignments. Finally we boarded at 5:30 and left, only to land at Sanford, normally a half hour flight, an hour later where we deplaned. We left Sanford on yet another third plane with the same crew. The pilot apologized for the lack of info but said on the prior flight they had lost navigation and instrumentation and so had ""been pretty busy"".

Modification of existing reservations: I was unable to modify an existing reservation online. As a result, I placed a call to the call center. It took 1 hour, 23 minutes before I was connected to a call agent. Because of the type of ticket purchased (""standard ticket""), there are ""stiff penalties"" to make changes. Those penalties are $75 per person, per flight. All the call agent could offer was to waive half of the $300 cancellation fees (total of $150) and my pre-booked bag fee, but would not waive the other half. I was informed it would not be ""fair"" to the other passengers who paid for the flexible type reservation. Our request to change dates was made 11 days after the original reservations were placed and 2 weeks prior to our trip. Allegiant Airlines will be able to sell the seats we are unable to use and keep all proceeds from the sale of those seats. After adding the penalties for reservation changes to the original ticket prices, we could have flown on a first class carrier for less.

The way this airline does business is deceiving and they knowingly try to take advantage over their customers with add on nickle and dime fees, and poor customer service.

We ended up needing 2 checked bags and no longer had use for the 1 overhead carry on. I tried to remove this carry on via their website and app but they don't allow you to do it. You can add bags no problem, but if you want to remove a bag they literally will not let you! I asked the customer service agent at the airport if they could remove the $43.00 bag charge as they could plainly see we did not have an overhead carry on with us. They told me no. I had to call their 1-800 number in order to get reimbursed.  On our way back home I actually asked another customer service agent again if they could help be take off the bag and they told me the same thing: call the 1-800 number. The flight was actually pleasant and the everyone was friendly on-board. A few hours after I got home from the return flight I called the 1-800 number. I was literally on hold for 1 hr and 25 minutes. I finally spoke with Kelly and told her what happened.

I told her my situation again, assuring her I did not bring on the overhead bag and that I notified both customer service people at the airport that I was not bringing a carry on bag onto the airplane. You would think the right thing to do would be to refund me $43.00 to keep the customer happy and move on? Do they think I'm lying and trying to sneak on a carry on bag for free to save $43.00 when I spent over $1,200 total on this trip? It makes no sense once so ever. I asked to speak with her manager directly and she would not let me. I asked her if $43.00 was worth losing a family of 4 for life? Her response was: ""Since we do not have proof you didn't bring the bag on the airplane we can only offer you a voucher"" So, because Allegiant makes it impossible to remove a bag once it is added and because you do not have the option to take this bag off either online or at the actual airport before your flight, they basically swindle you into yet another ""hidden charge"". I told her to keep the voucher and that me and my family will never be flying with this joke of an airline ever again. If you book a flight with Allegiant buyer be ware.

The first notification of delay came at 11:20am saying that the flight was delayed until 5:40pm. The second notification of delay came at 1:08pm saying that the flight was delayed until 7:00pm. The third notification of delay came at 5:04pm saying that the flight was delayed until 11:45pm. The fourth notification of delay came at 7:57pm saying that the flight was delayed until 12:45am. The aircraft did not arrive in PIE until 2:00am. The flight did not leave until about 3:00am on March 17th, 2018. We finally arrived at IND around 5:00am, but could not get off the plane until 5:30am because the crew at IND was not ready for us. We arrived 11 hours late. The crew at PIE said they were giving out meal vouchers to everyone on the plane, which is fine except the only thing available to eat at PIE includes: a small coffee shop, a limited bar, and a gift shop, which all closed around 8pm. Realizing their mistake, the crew at PIE orders pizza for the passengers. They did not account for people which dietary restrictions, like myself. I could not eat the pizza, otherwise I would get severely sick. So I sat in the PIE airport/airplane for about 11 hours, only having water. I was physically ill once I arrived in IND because I had no access to food for such a long period of time. I would've purchased some snacks on the plane, except the flight attendants did not serve everyone. I was one of those individuals that was not served. One would think that after 11 hours of delay, someone, just one person, would show some kind of customer service, but nope. I did not eat for 12.5 hours that day, because I did not have access to food, even on the airplane. One might ask, ""Why didn't you just leave the airport and go buy something at a restaurant?"" and then answer is ""because we physically could not leave."" TSA closed around 12:30am. Nobody could leave or enter the airport. Nobody. We were legitimately trapped inside the gate area. The option to cancel my flight or reschedule the flight was given. Except once you cancelled or rescheduled your flight, you couldn't leave the airport. You were still trapped inside the airport with those waiting for the aircraft to arrive. I was faced with two options in reality: 1) Wait for the plane to finally show up at 2am, with the possibility of it being cancelled (as explained in the next paragraph), or 2) Cancel/Reschedule my flight, but not being able to leave the airport until TSA opened the next morning so that they can open the exit doors. That would have left me in the airport, which i was told, until 5am. Physically being trapped in the airport, I decided to stick it out because at least I would be out of PIE by 5am. There was very little communication from anyone from Allegiant. I called customer service on 3/16/18 to ask why the flight was so delayed and what they were going to do for us, the passengers. After 58 minutes of being on hold, the agent raised her voice at me 3 times.  She said something along the lines of ""if the plane arrives at PIE at around midnight, they could cancel the flight.""

"""not a single enjoyable moment""",1,2017-12-23,"Booked a flight to Las Vegas out of Bellingham for this past Sunday, December 17th, we had to select a 2:45 departure losing half our day. Once boarded our flight 1812 we were met with mechanical issues. We were left sitting on the Tarmac for a while before they started de-boarding. Once inside we had to wait for further updates. Once they finally updated us they offered free pop and water. The  pilot was speaking to a passenger as she was exiting the airport, explaining she left her number and was going to the hotel. This was after 2 hours of sitting in the boarding area. Maybe an hour after the pilot left they finally made an announcement saying that we will be delayed until 9PM! At first they said no one could leave and return because TSA would be leaving. When asked if they could at least give the smokers a designated area on the Tarmac they hadn't even considered we have been at the airport since 12PM and would be landing in Las Vegas if your planes were taken care of and were reliable. Regular maintenance and planes on standby for these situations is part of the customer experience. They finally offered a 8$ voucher for Scotty Browns Social House where the going rate for anything is 15$ - some people had children and once at the restaurant I heard an older couple talking about their finances and ultimately went the entire day without food. When another plane arrived coming from Las Vegas the seating was different and those who paid for select seating we're told to expect a refund as we were now sitting in cramped conditions on hard flight chairs next to strangers. Even though they sat my friend alone where one of us could have sat with her and when asked if one of us could move to the empty chair they told us no. Once boarded it still took us an hour to get moving, making our departure for 10:30PM meaning we won't arrive in Las Vegas until well into 12:00 AM. They didn't even offer free snacks and beverages aboard your plane. We were told we would receive a $50 voucher towards our next flight and a refund on assigned seating on December 17th and it is currently December 21st and have yet to receive any further correspondence. As it stands I won't be flying Allegiant anymore.  The worst part of this is the fact that I lost show tickets and had to still pay for the hotel I didn't arrive at until 1 am. I understand things happen and they ensured we got to our destination safely. I also understand that some things are out of the airline control and there is a lot that goes on behind closed doors that the passengers may not be aware of.

"""lack the most minimum comforts""",3,2017-06-29,"✅ Verified Review | I was very disappointed at Allegiant and Austin-Bergstrom Airport after taking flight 1337 from Austin to Cincinnati Sunday night. There was no mention by Allegiant, warning passengers that the airline was now flying out of the 'South Terminal'. The terminal was a long drive from the main terminal, and anyone not arriving in plenty of time could have easily missed the shuttle from the main terminal to the 'south 40' where Allegiant now departs and arrives. This terminal is primitive at best. There are no jetways; you walk out on the tarmac to the aircraft, then climb a long set of incline ramps to get into the plane. Not fun in Texas 90-100 degree heat; I can only imagine what that would be like in a rainstorm! Any passenger flying Allegiant out of Austin should be warned in advance via your website, email or text message that the airline is now using a remote terminal with very limited facilities. I have taken three flights on Allegiant. On all three flights, the seats do not recline. They barely have padding. Allegiant should warn their potential passengers that their aircraft lack even the most minimum comforts. There is no free beverage service; not even a glass of water.

Some people had to rebook flights as they were connecting out of Vegas and were missing those connections. Well, we figured this could happen to any airline. However, on the way back the exact same thing happened! That was preceded by an announced gate change from Gate B-6 to Gate A-16, except there is no gate A-16 and we were left to scramble with other passengers trying to figure out where in the heck we were supposed to be, although our electronic boarding passes did eventually get properly updated. That was the third gate change they announced for different flights in the three hours we waited. I've never experienced that with any other airline. When it was time to board, the loud speaker did not work so those of us who paid for priority boarding heard nothing unless you were standing next to the guy speaking. And boarding was a full hour before the flight was supposed to be able to take off. Without word-of-mouth few priority boarders would have made it. But there was no rush because we were delayed once again due to ""computer malfunction"" and another reinspection checklist. We sat on the tarmac for an hour and 40 minutes. Once the plane started it was very slow getting moving, we lost the A/C - 110 in Vegas! - and the exhaust smell was overwhelming because they left the doors open too long. The upshot was the crew was very pleasant to us but they looked harried and exhausted themselves. I'm sure they must be sick of this as I now know delays are normal with Allegiant.

We booked a trip with Allegiant to fly from Ogdensburg NY (near our home town of Ottawa, Ontario) to Orlando but it's actually Sanford which is about 45 minutes from the Orlando International Airport and north of the city. Our departure flight was late due to heavy air traffic in the Orlando area; delay of 90 minutes. There is no car rental agency at all in Ogdensburg, so if you happen to get stuck there, you're out of luck! On June 10, we arrived back at the Sanford Airport, having dropped off our rental, and entered Terminal B to check in for our return flight on June 11. It was a clear day. We were greeted by an airport person that advised up before even entering the check-in line that our flight had been cancelled, and we would need to go to Terminal A (?). Once we walked all the way over there, we were in a line with all the other passengers from the flight. Two employees were at the counter. It took us over an hour to reach the front only to be told the flight was not rescheduled and we could fly home on Wednesday! No offers of anything other than a voucher to fly again with Allegiant for the missed flight; not the total. All this resulted in us having to book another car; drive to Orlando; book a JetBlue flight at $1000 to Syracuse; rent another car in Syracuse; drive to Ogdensburg to pick up our car, then back to Watertown to drop off the 3rd rental of that day and drive home; arriving in Ottawa at 6:00 a.m. the following day!

We weren't able to fly home with Allegiant because they're flight between TYS & EWR on a Sunday is a 9am flight (like I said, very specific) and 9am on Sunday morning didn't leave us enough time to enjoy our last day away. So here's the scoop, the seats don't recline, food and drinks are for a fee (nothing is complimentary), and there's a fee to pick specific seats on the plane so your party can all sit together.

Our flight attendant was more than rude and unprofessional. We were seated in the first row on the plane. We had bought our 15 month old her own seat so my husband, our daughter and myself had our own space. Our daughter was having trouble adapting to a confined space and was having a meltdown. My husband and I were trying everything we could to help soothe her during our initial taxi. The FA was on a huge power trip. Traveling with a toddler is stressful and not pleasant for anyone. She was lecturing us and talking down to us the entire flight was unnecessary and in poor taste. I was on the verge of tears by the time we landed because she wouldn't stop meddling in our situation. On our way home, we flew from Las Vegas to Rapid City, SD on 12/27. The universe must've been working against us since the same FA was on our return flight. This time my husband was seated in the exit row and my daughter and I were seated catty-corner behind him to his left. During initial prep, the FA had asked the exit row customers the routine ""incase of an emergency"" questions. My husband answered yes, he was willing and able. Half way through our flight my husband and I had traded spots as we switched off entertaining our daughter. One FA stopped at the exit row and told me I would need to pay for the seat if I was going to sit there. I explained to her we had already purchased the seat and were switching for a few minutes. The FA proceeded to make her way back to plane a few minutes after my conversation with the first flight attendant. She told me I wasn't allowed to sit there as she didn't initially brief me. I told her I understood and that I would switch seats with my husband. She returned 2 minutes later and had asked me if we had paid for the seat my daughter was sitting in. I said ""yes."" I'm upset because as a lead flight attendant, it's her job to know which seats are vacant and half way through a flight she was questioning us. 3 minutes pass and she approaches my husband who is now back in the exit row. She explains to him that she didn't brief him during the initial briefing and that he would need to be reseated.

I'm a very frequent flier on several airlines, and the value for money with Allegiant is excellent. I prefer a la carte pricing.

I skipped to the front of the line while checking my bag (the $6 I paid for priority boarding includes priority check-in / bag check), and had enormous legroom in my seat. Frequent flier hack: I found that I could get a cheaper international ticket on a mainline airline out of Washington DC than I could via anywhere in Ohio so I took Allegiant to BWI, then continued on from there to England.

On our way from a small town outside of a Wichita (an hour away)when returning to Las Vegas, we didn't know until we got to the airport (2 hours prior as told to do) we found out our flight was delayed 2 hours. That's ok, like I said, we had time to wait. The gate representative told us they had food vouchers for us, which we used. Then they made an announcement that the flight had been canceled due to problems with our plane and they had no other planes to come get us. They offered us a hotel voucher for the night and a shuttle to get us there. All staff was apologetic and understanding, which made it easier to stomach. We knew within an hour when our flight would be going out, which was the next day (a Tuesday when they don't even fly out on Tuesdays) at the same time. We got to the airport and checked our bag and they price our boarding passes since we couldn't access them online. They gave us more.food vouchers, gave us vouchers for another flight discount within the year, remembered me from the day before and moved us along expeditiously AND the costly snacks and beverages on the plane were free to all!

At 1:15, passengers who had the mobile app received text messages stating that the flight was delayed until 4:40. Passengers who did not have the app were confused because the screens at the gate and the mobile app itself did not reflect the delay. There was no Allegiant Air representative at the gate to provide clarification, so after 2:11 came and went, it was obvious that the delay was legit. At 3:30, an Allegiant air rep arrived at the gate and announced that our plane was due to land at 4:30, and that everybody needed to hurry up and board the plane after the passengers were released. At 4:00 the Allegiant attendant announced for everyone to ""be quiet and listen up"" because the plane was going to be a little later because of ""storms"" - and suggested that we look at weather radar to confirm the weather patterns. The plane landed at 5:00, and we were told that they needed to clean the plane before boarding. At 5:20 they started boarding special needs and priority passengers and told every one else not to get in line until their zone was called. Once they called for zone two, where people had already started lining up, an attendant again reminded us to ""be quiet and listen up"" and then said that we needed to hurry up and start boarding or else the flight would be canceled(?). They also told passengers for the flight to Orlando that was currently posted at our gate, that they needed to go to an alternate gate. A few of us brought it to representatives attention that the posted flight and time for Orlando on the screens were showing that it was departing from our gate, we were told that they didn't have anyone to change the information - so of course people who arrived at the gate after the announcement boarded the plane (oddly, not discovered at the gate by the attendants), and further delayed our take off as they were removed after everyone else was seated. Then at 5:45, the captain apologized for the delay, citing that they had some mechanical problems in Myrtle Beach (weren't the delays caused by ""storms""? The Allegiant rep even emphasized that we validate the presence of storms on the radar, guess that was a little white lie). Then the captain started yapping something about the fact that if we weren't airborne in exactly 15 minutes, the legal flight hours for the pilots would be exceeded and they would have to cancel the flight.

This made us lose 300$ car rental and hotel reservations. So, since the pilots were ""timed out"" they told us to get a hotel if we were more than 15 miles away, because they did not have a certain time for us to come back the next day and said they ""would email us"".

These seats don’t recline at all, the tray tables are smaller than they used to be and you can’t put anything in the seat back other than papers. You used to be able to put a water bottle or other items in the seat pocket, but no more. This airline charges you for everything, so I’m not sure you are really saving much money on Allegiant. Refreshments cost a minimum of $2 for a can of pop. I normally barely pay that for a 12 pack of pop. Their schedule to Ft Wayne is very limited, making it harder to schedule your stay. And they don’t even fly to Ft Wayne at ALL from 8/13 to 11/15.  Either you are providing service to the city or not. When the pilots gave announcements, we could not hear what he was saying because he talked so softly. I asked the people sitting in my row if they heard what he said, and they could not hear him either. On the return flight, the cabin temperature became very warm inside. I did ask the flight attendant if she could lower the temp, and apparently she did because it became slightly cooler in the cabin. Also on the return flight, after a short while the pilot turned on the seat belt sign and kept it on the entire way back. There were a few bumpy periods during this time, but not the whole way back.

My boyfriend lives in Florida and I live in Ohio, so the price that Allegiant offers is very competitive compared to other airlines. I've never been thrilled by my flights with Allegiant (inconvenient times, not a lot of flexibility, fees for bags and reservation changes that add up), but it does have its perks (affordable, small airlines so less security hassle, nonstop flights). However, the past couple of flights we have experienced multiple delays. It seems almost as if this is becoming a signature of Allegiant flights. This past flight was already inconveniently timed to fly out at 8pm and arrive at 10pm (this would be fine if there was a choice, but this was the only time available from LCK). That afternoon, the flight was delayed by 40 minutes. Annoying, but no big deal (I should mention that the airport is an hour away from my final destination, so each delay made the drive to Sarasota more and more inconvenient). Once I was at the airport (arrived early at 5:30, figured I could work on homework or read), I received a text message that the flight was delayed until 9:16pm (there was not an announcement at the airport for a while - only text messages at first). Around 9pm, we received another missive that informed us that the flight would leave at 10:56pm. The workers at the airport were not at the gate for most of this, maybe avoiding angry passengers? There were sporadic announcements to the gates. Long story short, we left at 11:30pm and arrived around 1:30am; I arrived in Sarasota around 2:45am, almost 4 hours later than I had planned. Allegiant never explained to us the reason for such a drastic delay (only made worse by the lateness of the original flight). Was it weather? The flight was flying out of Myrtle Beach and into Ohio. Was it computer issues (they seem to encounter these a lot - which only freaks me out more about the safety of the flights)? Something else? The pilot and flight attendants were all very kind on the flight, and all of the passengers were pretty complacent (no annoying irate passengers to deal with - which I appreciated). However, an explanation would have been nice. Maybe even some free food on the flight to make up for the 3 hour delay! I'm not sure if I'll be flying Allegiant again. Probably I will, because I can't afford to fly anyone else. While there are some good things about Allegiant, I still have many major issues with them.

I paid extra for priority seating and carrying my bag on the plane. I printed my boarding pass off at home and then downloaded the app so I had it in my phone as well. This way I never had to deal with the counter. I always have snacks on me so the fact that you had to pay for Snacks/drinks (water too) didn't bother me. I also didn't think the seats were uncomfortable or there was a leg room issue. If you fly a lot most planes these days have decreased their legroom so for 3 hours it wasn't a big deal. My only ""complaint"" is that departure time seems to be a suggestion. We left about 45 minutes late. The boarding process was slow so be prepared for that. I would suggest paying the $15ish fee and get priority boarding and a seat at the front of the plane. I thought the staff were friendly and I would fly them again.

Both times the flight was cancelled we stood in line for over an hour to receive a $100 voucher for a future flight. Allegiant has no extra planes to send in so you just have to stay overnight and since our flight was supposed to be at 7.15 am that means hanging out at the hotel all day unless you want to pay to rent a car. Allegiant counter staff were fairly rude and matter of fact - the man behind us had a wife graduating from college that night and was going to have to miss it.
