Firstly I love travelling with them due to the airport they are based in which is near Kuala Lumpur city centre at Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport, Subang. The airport is small, which makes the experience that much better. An early morning flight means leaving 30-40 mins before the flight as long as I have checked in online. ALso love the fact if I haven't checked in I can also check in the return flight on the outbound sector, saves so much time. Boarding is usually 5-10 mins before stated departure time, which can make some new flyers with them a little jittery. One of the things that strikes me with Firefly is that I have yet to see a male flight attendant and I have to admit being surprised at the number of female pilots flying for this airline, kudos to them. The plane is a small ATR plane and a drink and snack is provided on the short flight. The seat and toilets are very clean. Flight Attendants speak very good english and are very professional.

Firefly customer review,4,2010-04-26,Penang to Subang (KL) and back to Penang. Flight was around 20 MYR (5USD) more expensive than MAS or Air Asia however since Subang is so much closer to the city I felt it was well worth it. Subang airport has been refurbished and is very modern in comparison to my first visit when FireFly was founded. New ATR 72-500 are also much nicer planes to fly than the old Fokker 50. Check-in was efficient and flights were slightly late boarding but made up time in the air and arrived on time. The crew was friendly and efficient however not as welcoming as the MH crew. (FireFly is a subsidiary of MH). They served fruit juice and a small piece of cake for this 35min trip. Not bad and good value for money.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Firefly customer review,5,2010-03-29,SIN-KUA-SIN with family + 1 child + 1 infant. Infant seat belts were offered unlike Tiger and Air Asia. ATR72-500 were new (capacity 72 pax). Drinks (OJ or apple juice) peanuts and muffins served with 2 FAs. Drinks were done 2 rounds in the 1 hr flight. FAs were friendly and customer service orientated. Air sick bags and inflight mag were avail in each seat. Flight to Kuantan about 98% full while flight to Singapore was about 90% full. Seats were arranged 2x2. There was 1 toilet available. We paid for S$70 for the promotion return airfares! Overall we enjoyed the flights and will not hesitate to fly with them again.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Firefly customer review,5,2010-02-07,Penang-Langkawi. New and clean ATR friendly FAs cold drink free service air fare including taxes about £10 each would thoroughly recommend this airline.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Firefly customer review,5,2009-07-15,Singapore to Kuala Lumpur Subang. Took several round trip flights between Singapore - Budget Terminal and Kuala Lumpur - Subang in July. On time flights new aircraft. Low fares with no extra charges for seating checked baggage or refreshments unlike on budget airlines. In particular departing and arriving at Kuala Lumpur Subang is very quick and much closer to Petaling Jaya and downtown Kuala Lumpur. Only quibbles are that the ATR72 can be bumpy in turbulent weather and that the food (muffin) & drink (juice) onboard are uninspiring. Try to get a seat at the rear of the aircraft as ATR72s only have one door at the rear.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Firefly customer review,1,2009-07-14,"I had the worst experience flying Firefly. Flew to Koh Samui on 8th July with my family for a five day vacation. Was suppose to leave on Sunday (12th July) at 1100 hrs. Flight was delayed to 1530 hours due to bad weather. Was informed later that there was a further delay. My husband called up the Firefly customer service and was informed that the flight was cancelled. Imagine we were all still sitting at the departure hall at 5.00 p.m. and there was no announcement that the flight was cancelled. We were all fuming mad and finally we told the airport officials to check with KL office. They finally called and confirmed that the flight was cancelled and we were told to return the next day. I am truly disappointed with the service. To top it all our ordeal was not over yet the next day we were informed that our flight would be at 6.00p.m instead of 11.20 a.m. as we have not ""checked out"" yet. We did not understand what the Thai officers were trying to tell us. Wasn't all this technical arrangement suppose to be done automatically for the passengers? We had to wait for another two hours before we finally got our seats! Talk about providing great service!",False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Firefly customer review,4,2009-05-11,Kerteh - Subang evening flight departed on time and arrived roughly 5 minutes earlier than expected. Ground service efficient. Check in and boarding without hassle. Plane interior very clean. FAs friendly and service fairly good. Light snacks (biscuits) and drink served promptly after departure. In-flight announcement was a bit hard to understand especially the one made in English seemed like FA in a hurry. Other than that nothing to complain about. For the price they are offering will use them again,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Firefly customer review,5,2009-04-19,I have just returned from a trip to Alor star (AOR) from subang (SZB) and it was a very pleasant flight with FY. Flights took off on time and the crew were friendly and genuine. Overall excellent trip with FY. I wish they flew into KUL as well for easier connections to other points.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Firefly customer review,3,2009-03-11,Kuala Lumpur to Pekanbaru Indonesia about a one-hour flight. Our plane was scheduled to depart at noon but we arrived to find that the flight had been delayed until 2:30 as one of their airplanes had technical problems and was removed from their fleet of 5 planes. Although we had supplied contact information and they acknowledged that they should have called us to let us know about the delay we received no information. When we did board the flight was nerve-wracking due to turbulence most of the way.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Firefly customer review,5,2009-02-16,Langkawi to Penang. Bargain price of £24 for 2 pax one way. Excellent service took of on time and landed 5 minutes early. (flight time was only 25 mins) check in was simple and no hassle about baggage allowance (we were a tad over but they didn't charge us) Plane looked brand new leather seats very comfortable. Would use again and they can teach some of the British budget airlines a thing or two!,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Firefly customer review,5,2009-02-16,Penang-Langkawi on ATR Flight was on time crew worked excellent together and the flight attendants were cheerfully serving orange juice and water during this 20 minute flight. A very good experience.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Firefly customer review,4,2008-11-06,PEN-LGK. A 90 minute delay to a flight of barely 30 mins is not a good start and a load factor of less than 20% doesn't bode well either. Booked last minute and got a bargain fare which made the trip cost only slightly more than the ferry which takes nearly 3 hours. A BOB trolley service came round once but on such a short flight no-one was interested. I had collected my luggage and was in a taxi less than 5 mins after landing. If there had been no delay this would have been a 5 star journey.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Firefly customer review,5,2008-07-04,Penang-Subang-Penang. Cabin crew helpful and friendly. Starting last month FireFly increase its baggage allowance for check-in baggage from 15kg to 20kg.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Firefly customer review,4,2008-03-04,Penang - Langkawi. Quick hop over btw the islands. Price very good thru the net. Be careful if you come from a Malaysia Airlines flight to Firefly as baggage allowance is only 15 Kgs. Cost more for 8 Kgs of baggage than the flight. Buy on Board prices good though didn't bother due to it being a short flight. Left 15 mins early landed 30 mins early!,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
Firefly customer review,5,2008-02-25,SZB - Lankawi return and SZB - Penang return. Subang airport is peaceful quiet efficient and close to Kuala Lumpur. Check in swift and boarding seamless as seat numbers assigned and the planes are small Fokker 50's. The flights were very comfortable (former MAS seating not budget) with friendly flight attendants. Proper assignation of seat numbers makes such a difference compared to the shambolic scrum at LCC terminal. I hope they expand and operate many more routes from SZB.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,False,
