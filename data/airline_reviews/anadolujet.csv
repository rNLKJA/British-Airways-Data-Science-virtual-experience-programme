"""seats are really tight and bad""",1,2022-11-05,"Worst trip ever. For each extra kg you pay 12 euros, if you don't have pre-ordered luggage then a 25kg will cost around 300 euros. The seats are really tight and bad, I cant even fit regularly there (190cm height). Don't recommend to anyone at all, fly with other companies",True,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Tel Aviv,November 2022,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,1,False

"""no free luggage to check-in""",1,2022-08-20,Not Verified |  Very bad experience. We booked on Turkish Airline t0 find ourselves flying on AnadoluJet with no free luggage to check-in. So we had to pay to check-in our luggage. The staff were not helpful and not professional in dealing with customers especially the staff at the gate. The plane has no entertainment whatsoever. Not even outlet to charge mobiles.,False,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Riyadh,August 2022,2,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,1,False
"""the worst airline I’ve used""",2,2022-08-03,"This was a very quiet flight with lots of spare seats. However I was shocked how bad the staff where towards passengers. This was by far the worst airline I’ve used and made the customer feel really uncomfortable. Staff asleep across seats and the others had no interest and  looked disinterested. This was the easy stuff to get right. Early in the flight we were given a cheese roll and a drink, but after that not even offered a drink to buy, Tea, coffee, cold drinks nothing. For a 4.5hr flight this can’t be right or even allowed.",True,Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Antalya to Stansted,August 2022,3,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",2,1,,,False
"""this was my worst flight ever""",1,2022-01-14,"My departure time was on 23.15 from SAW airport. I went to the check-in counter at around 20.30. As the counter was assigned to literally all of the AnadoluJet flights, I had to wait in the line for more than an hour and a half. When I finally reached the counter, I noticed that the staff cannot speak English effectively. In fact, they pronounced ""kg"" as ""Kee Zhee"". On top of that great experience so far, there still was a surprise awaiting me. Right at the counter, I realized that the baggage allowance for this flight is 20 Kg, not 25 Kg, and not 30 Kg. That, of course, was my own fault. My baggage was 7 Kg overweight and I was willing to pay for that extra weight. You may not believe it, but that simple process took almost an hour because it was so hard for them to accept USD instead of YTL or EUROs. Finally, after a long wait in the final passport control gate, I ran from there to the flight gate and reached there at around 23.05. But, it was not the end of that terrible experience. When I got onboard, I realized that the passengers are arranged as if there has never been a COVID 19 pandemic. Everyone was sitting in the closest possible distance from the next person and meanwhile there was no passenger in almost 1/5 of the plane. In addition to that, when I found my seat, I noticed that there is no room for my hand bag in the compartment above my head. When I asked the flight attendant for help, he, again with the most possibly basic English, responded that he cannot do anything because he does not know whose belongings are occupying the compartment. Finally, I should add that, I am from Iran and my country is not known for its high quality airlines, but even so, this was my worst flight ever.",True,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Tehran,January 2022,2,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",1,1,,1,False
"""The seat was the worst part of the flight!""",2,2021-11-25,"I bought this flight under Turkish Airlines name and I was totally disappointed when I saw the Anadolujet sign at the check-in desk. First of all, a delay without any updates: I had to check FR24 for updates. The seat was the worst part of the flight! I had a back pain right after the flight. Catering was awful. Lots and lots of unnecessary announcements made the flight even worse! They were not letting the passengers sleep at 5am due to their long and annoying announcements. Not recommended at all.",True,Boeing 737-900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tehran to İzmir,November 2021,1,3,,2,3,,,False

Flight left and arrived on time with regular pilot updates.

"""service provided by the staff was friendly""",7,2021-06-14,"A low cost sister company of Turkish airlines offering domestic and international flights in the European area. The flight wasn't bad at all, service provided by the staff was friendly, attentive and correct. We received a lunch package consisting of a bottle of water, fruit juice, chocolate cake and cheese sandwich. Not bad for a budget airline. Seat pitch was incredibly tight and anyone over 1.85m won't fit in. There's no in-flight entertainment or Wi-Fi whatsoever.

"""more than 5 months to get my money back""",1,2019-08-03,Istanbul to Diyarbakir. Anadolujet canceled my flight with no reason. It took more than 5 months to get my money back.

"""Definitely recommended""",9,2019-04-19,Ankara to Antalya. The plane was relatively new with a nice interior. Coffee/tea and a sandwich/cake were coplimentary on a 50m domestic flight.

"""plane was really old!",1,2017-08-13,"✅ Verified Review | I have flown from Diyarbakır to Çanakkale via Ankara with one day delay because Ankara flight delayed one hour. Ground service staff was bad in giving correct information, really slow in handling passengers with transfer flights. No guidance at the airport. Accomodation was acceptable but really short (10 hours) for one day delay. One meal ticket they have provided for waiting at the airport for 12 hour was not enough. Plane was really old. Seats dirty with past eaten food crumbs. My height is 1.76 meters. Area between seats were too small for me. Sandwich and tea they gave at the flight was ok.

AnadoluJet customer review,1,2014-04-21,Antalya-Ankara direct flights of Turkish Airlines are operated by Anadolu Jet that is a trademark of Turkish Airlines. Anadolu Jet has no Business Class Service and you are obligated to a low profile service as long as you don't transfer through Istanbul. For the CIP Lounge you have to pay an additional fee that doesn't fit with Gold Card holders. No options is a severe pain.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,2,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,1,,,False
AnadoluJet customer review,7,2014-03-06,TK7087 16th Feb. Flew VAN to Ankara on 737. Flight delayed due to bad weather in VAN and because 2 passengers wanted to disembark after the final door was closed (which then meant everyone had to grab their hand luggage and the overhead bins had to be checked). The flight itself was pleasant with a small snack on the short flight. The crew were very friendly too.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,,,,True

AnadoluJet customer review,9,2010-11-24,Istanbul-Stansted return by Anadolu Jet- low cost carrier of Turkish Airlines. Both flights were on time. Plane was a tired 738 but for the money I paid for ( 250 Euros) during Eid it really didn't matter. Leg space is narrow but if you get front seats you could get a few extra inches. Complimentary food and snacks were served during the flight which is a plus since low cost carriers hardly do that anymore. Crew were friendly and pilots kept us informed. No inflight entertainment but again for the value of the ticket it didn't matter that much.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
