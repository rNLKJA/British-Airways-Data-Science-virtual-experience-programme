"""extremely friendly and quick""",10,2016-01-25,We flew the wonderful StarFlyer aircraft from Kansai to Tokyo Haneda. The check-in staff was extremely friendly and quick and their security line had nobody in it. The boarding was speedy we timed it and we got on and took off within 25 minutes. We were dissatisfied by the fact that we could not redeem United miles as the airline is partly owned by ANA. overall the flight was above and beyond.,False,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,KIX to HND,July 2015,5,5,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",5,5,,5,True

StarFlyer customer review,5,2008-07-25,Tokyo-Osaka-Tokyo. Starflyer has the best cost/performance ratio of the market: very comfortable leather seat in A320. Easy to get emergency exit at check in when requested but still at least 34 inch legroom. Drink service PTV footrest for 1 hour flight and professional attendants. At a unbeatable rate when booking a bit in advance (even less than the Shinkansen). The only drawbacks are the lack of frequency for Osaka comparing to JL or NH still OK with 6 flights per day.,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,False
