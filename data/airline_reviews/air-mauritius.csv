In addition, the Kenya Airways / Qatar Airways flights to Nairobi and Doha / Manchester were all cancelled due to the Coronavirus, as the airlines were not flying on these routes, with no availability to travel until at least mid-April (this now appears unlikely as the Mauritius authorities have imposed restrictions). We were informed this was the last commercial flights to UK from Mauritius, so there was no option but to book and look to recoup costs back from Credit Card company give the crisis situation. This was reflected in the cost of the one way ticket to London Heathrow. Never have I seen Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport so deserted and quiet. However check in was easy. Boarding was a little chaotic, as this flight was full (this was a concern as it was impossible to evidence concepts of social distancing in the flight as would be expected given the impact of Coronavirus, though I wore a face mask for majority of the flight). Cabin crew themselves were dressed with appropriate Protective Equipment (PPE) for the 12 hour flight to reduce risks of infection. The flight itself represents an improvement from the last time I travelled with Air Mauritius some 25 years ago !. Cabin crew were kind, friendly and attentive and service has improved. The meals sadly are of poor quality. Lukewarm, with little in the way of decent portion size (though they provided my Vegetarian Special meal). Bread was stale unfortunately, and the dessert was an odd combination of rice and sugary milk ?? Menus were not provided, which is a shame. The inflight entertainment is ok, and the flight map and routing was good. Unfortunately could not connect to the complimentary WIFI online, as it would not recognise my booking details. In summary, definite improvements noted with Air Mauritius which was welcome. The new Airbus A330neo is a lovely aircraft. Pilot gave timely announcements. Sadly the toilets were not being attended to (perhaps more due to some of the ignorant passengers onboard whom have no empathy for the airline or the crew).The only deficits as mentioned was the meal quality, otherwise it was good. A great shame I could not get a connection back to Manchester (due to the Coronavirus, but good a rental car for a quick 3 hour drive to Manchester Airport from Heathrow to collect my car and get back home). I would travel with Air Mauritius again if need be - most likely from Mauritius to destinations such as India, Malaysia and local regional areas such as Reunion Island, Rodrigues and Seychelles.

Air Mauritius customer review,1,2015-08-20,A truly awful experience and one as a family we have no wish to repeat by flying again. It was a daytime flight and all the cabin window shutters were kept down and the lights kept down so we flew in darkness - we asked the purser to put up the lights and blinds and we were told he could not do this. There was obviously bright sunshine outside but we were subjected to flying in darkness. The food was truly awful - I am not expecting haute cuisine on an economy flight but we were served pap. We have eaten good food in Mauritius but no attempt was made to serve reasonable food - no fresh fruit - it is a tropical island and I believe an attempt to serve a slice of pineapple is possible even on a tight budget but the salad that was presented was ghastly. The bread rolls were as stale as bricks on all three meals presented - watch your costs but don't bother presenting it to customers as a meal. Just because they have a tray to fill with their little boxes for a 3 course meal doesn't mean the customer should be treated as a fool! The whole experience was a shambles and can reflect on the island of Mauritius as a destination.

We found the airline to be no frills and got us from A to B efficiently. My complaints are the economy class seats on the older Airbus A340-300s operating from London and Paris to Mauritius were worn uncomfortable and had a terrible entertainment system I struggled to sleep the whole 12 hours. The newer Airbus A330-200s operating the Mauritius to Perth route was more comfortable and had a better newer entertainment system though the particular flight we were on was packed full and quite uncomfortable for an 8 hour flight. The cabin crew did their job but did not go out of their way to offer any additional service. The food service onboard depended on which route you fly on the Parisian route we got a decent curry dinner and a refreshing French breakfast but on the Perth flight we only received a bland meal at about midnight and a horrible hot (vegetable substance) in a bread roll for arrival when all we felt like having something refreshing I noticed a large majority of people did not eat it.

Air Mauritius customer review,,2014-01-14,Recently travelled to India on an Air Mauritius flight back and fro on MK748 and MK 749 respectively. However I am very disappointed by the services offered on board. I travelled together with my spouse and infant of less than 2 years old. On departure on 27th December we requested a baby cot (ticket booked on 11th November 2013 - more than a month before) and on check-in same was requested again and approval obtained. However to our disappointment we did not get one on board. The reason given was that the baby was too big for the cot and the weight was too heavy. The infant weighs: 10.3 kg and his height is 73 centimetres. The crew did not even bother to check if the infant fits the cot or not but bluntly refused. We had to hold a crying baby whole night which not only disturbed us but we had an earful from other passengers. On our return (10th Jan 2014) same scenario. Despite request no infant cot and even worse we did not have a front seat to handle a baby. Instead we were put on a seat with other seats in front which was really uncomfortable. I and my spouse had to carry the infant whole night. There was another couple who benefited from a cot and we tried it on my infant and he fits perfectly well. In fact we had more rooms than expected. When I told the cabin crew they told me that you are not in a front seat and hence cannot give you one now. (The irony is that a cot was requested and approved at Check-in in Mumbai). We did not even get an infant meal on both trips. The service we got on the flight was very disappointing and frustrating.

The staff appeared so uninterested - I would suggest Air Mauritius employ some staff from a country where people want to work. On return I noted that Air Mauritius did have some staff apparently not Mauritian perhaps in an attempt to lift the service standard. Two cups of tea only in a long flight one with UHT milk and one with that chemical called ""Creamer"" so I had coffee instead of tea to hide the revolting taste. Return flight about 90% full.

Never again.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,4,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,2,,,False
Air Mauritius customer review,2,2013-03-22,Fly Air Mauritius once a year and the service keeps going down. Leg room is very poor seat material is old and dirty entertainment equipment is old. On our last flight my wife pressed the service button after 10 mins no one came. She had to go to the back of the plane where all the attendants were too busy having a chat to ask for a bottle of water.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,,False
Air Mauritius customer review,5,2013-03-15,PER-MRU-PER August 2012 - A330-200. Plane is fairly new on PER-MRU legs. Travelling with toddler (under 2) and 2 adults. Economy pretty standard config and seats small but relatively comfortable. Outbound at PER not allowed to use QF lounge even though I was QP. Plane quite empty. Had to wait for 1.5 hrs for Virgin arrival from Melbourne which had 40+pax on. Even with them the flight was about 70% loading. Gave us a row of 4 to us so we were able to lay the child down for a nap. Outbound was daytime flight and quite easy - IFE very basic. Food was ok (poor entree). Not a lot of drinks (hot cabin too) and service was too quick with them wanting to get everything out the way ASAP. Toddler given an infant meal (as she was on an infant ticket) and we were not allowed to get anything else as there was no other food loaded. Return - slightly more full but this time we were given a bulkhead. Pointless with a toddler but we did have a row of 4. Word of warning the bulkhead rows the arm rests do not lift up. Overnight flight but bulkhead was near toilet which was going all night - so impossible to get sleep. Also some annoying little blue light sits right above you so its not dark either. On SSR/MRU Airport second comments from Philip Loveder below. Airport cant cope with 3 x 747 and A330 leaving at the same time. Place was packed. No chairs nowhere to sit even on the floor. If you are on your own fine but with kids its hard work! Poor timing of scheduling of the flights left a bad feeling to what was an amazing holiday.,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,3,,,True
Air Mauritius customer review,,2013-01-07,The customer service was non existent. We were sat at the back of the plane near the toilets so the 12 hour flight we had no peace with people going back and forward. Couldn't even draw the curtain to block out the light from the area of the toilet and where the cabin crew sat. The leg room in economy was the worst we have experienced. Bad enough for me who is 5 ft 5 awful for my husband who is 6ft 2. We didn't even realise we would travel Air Mauritius for this long flight we had booked with Air France. Awful experience.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,1,,,False
Air Mauritius customer review,2,2012-12-21,Flight MK 034 from MRU to CDG on 12-12-08. The most uncomfortable trip in business-class we have had. The seats are not only no lie-flat when you try to find a position to sleep it is not possible as you always slip downwards. The cabin-crew were unfriendly and unenthusiastic.

Air Mauritius customer review,7,2012-12-10,Flew SIN-MRU-KUL-SIN. Have flown several times before and I have received the same consistent good service every time. Check in was uneventful and normal. Boarding was quic the crew were smiling and friendly. The interior of the A330-200 is fresh and new. The seat though wasn't something to smile about. It was pretty cramped and I couldn't sleep a wink throughout the night flight. IFE was good decent selection of films and games. Food was also good really enjoyed it however there was no cabin presence throughout the night flight. Overall it was quite a good flight and I would recommend Air Mauritius.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,3,"<span class=""star fill"">4</span>",,4,,,True
Air Mauritius customer review,,2012-11-28,On 26/09/12 my family travelled to Mauritius (11 people). We embarked on our journey from Melbourne on Virgin to Perth then boarded Air Mauritius. The first thing I noticed was how old the plane was leg room was non existent and felt really boxed in. The onboard entertainment was not working - made it hard to entertain 6 teenagers on an 8 hour flight. I felt the staff were annoyed with any request made. Upon our return to Australia the experience seemed worse. The cabin temperature was really hot which made it uncomfortable. Refreshments were only served twice. The crew were unresponsive - no politeness customer interaction no smiles - almost robotic. Service is an integral part of customer satisfaction.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,2,,,False
Air Mauritius customer review,6,2012-11-08,Pleasantly surprised by the service. I found the seats were just too small and quite hard but overall you get what you pay for.

Air Mauritius customer review,7,2012-11-03,Perth to Mauritius return. Allowed to use Qantas club lounge at Perth which was good as usual. Lounge at Mauritius less impressive and completely full due to number of departing flights. IFE terrible (about 10 films with only one option suitable for children) but otherwise reasonable. Lie flat seats were at quite an angle but reasonably comfortable for short night flight on return leg. Food was better than anticipated. In flight service was reasonable and friendly. Make sure you stick on your 'do not disturb' sticker on a night flight otherwise the staff wake you for breakfast even if you're fast asleep; if you have pre-assigned seats make sure you ensure they've given you those seats at check in; pre-load your own IFE on an ipad or laptop!,False,,,Business Class,,,3,4,"<span class=""star fill"">2</span>",,4,,,True
Air Mauritius customer review,1,2012-10-29,London and back in Oct 2012. I wish now I had read the reviews here first otherwise we would not have flow Air Mauritius.

Air Mauritius customer review,8,2012-10-24,LHR-MRU-LHR 12 -17 Oct Economy class in extra legroom seats in both directions. Cabin crew were friendly with many drink rounds and smiles all round. I have to say that without the extra legroom seats I could not sit in a normal seat due to the tight space and entertainment box's under the seats. Best thing to do would be to take a few rows out and remove the entertainment equipment as its very outdated.,False,,,Economy Class,,,4,4,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,4,,,True
Air Mauritius customer review,6,2012-10-14,A340 Mauritius to Heathrow overnight flight generally good reasonable comfort and good service - but why did the aircon have to be at full cold for the whole 12 hour flight making it almost impossible sleep.

Air Mauritius customer review,5,2012-10-07,PER-MRU-PER. We flew Air Mauritius as a codeshare with Air Austral. All-in-all a fairly reasonable flight experience for the price although we did suffer a quite long delay on the return flight due to technical issues with the aircraft that needed to be sorted out. The cabin attendants were friendly and responsive both ways however there was insufficient water provided during the return flight which in a warmer than usual cabin was disappointing. The food was only fair to be honest but the wine pretty reasonable. My main issue was the ground staff and boarding process at MRU. A lack of updates on the delay and a temporary breakdown of the boarding card readers slowed things down even further. The SSR (Plaissance) airport in Mauritius is okay but fills to bursting when you have 3 flights leaving at once which was the case on the evening we flew. Chaos!,False,,,Economy Class,,,3,3,"<span class=""star fill"">3</span>",,4,,,True
Air Mauritius customer review,7,2012-09-09,We flew from Mauritius to Anantanrivo and back recently. We were impressed by the efficiency of check in and the punctuality of the flights. Though not expecting any food on this short haul flight we were surprised to receive a quick small lunch with a complimentary drinks run which was most welcome and refreshing. The FAs were pleasant and efficient. The aircraft A340 was clean and leg room was satisfactory for short haul sector.

AT CDG there were no ground staff to guide I just managed to catch my flight. Got to my seat found the fellow passenger sitting next to me was intoxicated and immediately started being a real nuisance by interfering with my entertainment system and changing his postured endlessly. I reported this fact to the chief cabin crew. I was given another seat.

Air Mauritius customer review,6,2012-07-09,Flew to Mauritius from Edinburgh via CDG. My wife and I could not fault the service from the staff on board although an attempt by a flight steward to fix both our TV monitors failed on the way out. Food and wine was in plentiful supply both ways.

Air Mauritius customer review,2,2012-05-28,LHR-MRU-LHR. Poor seating told we had bulkhead seats during check-in but found this was not the case upon boarding. On outbound and return flight we had specifically selected the vegetarian option yet no veg meal was available on the return flight.

Air Mauritius customer review,1,2012-04-25,LHR-MRU-LHR. Very disappointed with inflight service. The quality of the food was very poor. Entertainment choice was limited and outdated. Staff service was bad. Travelled with children but unfortunately did not specifically request kids meals which meant they were served the adults over spiced food. Travelled in the middle 4 seats (2-4-2) which had the added discomfort that only 2 of the 3 arm rests lifted making it difficult to sleep on the overnight to MRU.,False,,,Economy Class,,,1,1,"<span class=""star fill"">1</span>",,3,,,False

Air Mauritius customer review,2,2012-03-02,Very disappointed with the inflight service. Flight from Mauritius to Heathrow is 12.5 hrs.

Flight staff on the ground and cabin crew helpful. Food quality generally ok. You could have as many drinks as you required. However that's where the positives end the seating was cramped and no way is the seat pitch 33/34 inch as stated.

Air Mauritius customer review,1,2011-12-29,Worst airline ever. Business class ticket they lost our luggage and did nothing to find them. We spent 8 days in Mauritius with a 15 months old baby and without any luggage a nightmare. Our luggage were lost in Nairobi. It's not the first time it happens but with other airlines they usually find them and deliver them in a couple of days. Service in the flight is bad.

Air Mauritius customer review,3,2011-12-21,I was delayed more than 48 hrs in Shanghai Pudong Airport! The whole ordeal started when we boarded the plane we were told there was a technical problem and take off would be delayed. The crew had to open the middle doors for us as it was getting too hot inside. During the 4 hr wait we did not get any food or drinks! We were driven finally after 5 hours on the tarmac back to the terminal to be dumped in the airport hotel without food or information. For the next 2 days we were left without any info on the flight! We had to fight with airport staff to get our luggage back after more than 24hrs.

Air Mauritius customer review,7,2011-10-16,Melbourne-Mauritius-Nairobi return pleasantly surprised by the level of service we received. For both long haul services requested and received exit rows - which can be quite difficult to do with other airlines. I found the seats comfortable food was fine and there was never any issue about heading down to the back galley to get a drink when you felt like one. The staff on the whole were very friendly.

Air Mauritius customer review,,2011-10-13,Horrific flight out managed to sleep a little on the way back but only because I probably could have slept standing. The seats were horribly uncomfortable (comparable to a short haul easy jet flight possibly worse) and any room for your feet is taken-up by the inflight entertainment box. Inflight entertainment had poor screens and an even poorer selection of films. Seats badly damaged with wire from the document holder (which had somehow reversed its spring) forcing into my knees for the whole way out. Flight staff polite but seemed to be very pleased with themselves which added to the depression of the whole experience. Booked through Kuoni so expected the flight to be fine I won’t be so trusting in future. I find it hard to believe given the cost of everything on Mauritius that their airline has to be so poor.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Air Mauritius customer review,8,2011-09-13,London Heathrow to Mauritius return. I'm 5'10 and average build and found I had sufficient room to recline and doze a bit for the 12 hr flight. The inflight entertainment was good with a large touchscreen offering recent movies tv documentaries and games - all on-demand. The only drawback is that the screen is sometimes too touch sensitive or not at all which can be frustrating at times. Going out mine froze all together once but the stewardess reset it within minutes. The food was tasty and service not intrusive. However there was no announcement that drinks were always available in the galley - I only knew this from previous reviews. Flight out was just 1 hr delayed due to late inbound arrival but return flight taxied dead on time and arrived 30 mins early.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Air Mauritius customer review,8,2011-09-05,Paris to Mauritius return on Business with a promotional fare. Warm welcome from staff served a choice of pre- flights drinks with a local tropical touch. Starters main courses and desserts tasty and again with a creole twist that was memorable. The lie-flat seat is comfortable with relax and massage options. Plenty of space for storage and water bottles provided before going to sleep. Only 2 things to improve - the IFE is not on-demand and the choice of movies is limited there are no snacks/drinks buffet on overnight flights which last about 11 hrs. Otherwise a satisfying trip where I managed to get 7 hrs sleep.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Air Mauritius customer review,3,2011-09-04,Mauritius to London Heathrow. The service was below average. Food was satisfactory although served chicken for every meal. The television did not work I told a cabin crew member 3 times and she simply said 'ok I'll come back to you' she didn't for 12 hours. As for the other points they were satisfactory. Not much leg space and variety of films and shows.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False

Air Mauritius customer review,1,2011-07-18,Paris-Mauritius-Paris Economy on A340's. Poor service on both flights. Seats very uncomfortable they seem to tilt forward and have limited space. Food OK but drinks service appalling. 1 trolley service and 1 round of soft drinks for 11 hr flight! If you wanted more drinks you had to go to the galley at the back to help yourself where the flight attendants were sitting chatting/reading or putting on their makeup!

Air Mauritius customer review,7,2011-07-03,MRU-MEL-SYD - A340. Service on board was very good however a couple of announcements could have been made by staff prior to boarding in Mauritius warning Sydney passengers in transit that their duty free spirits purchased in Mauritius would be confiscated by security staff upon arrival at Melbourne airport. The onus is on the Airline to warn its passengers that only a limited amount of liquid would pass security requirements at the second check point. This problem occurs quite often and results in quite an unnecessary loss of revenue to passengers unaware of this legal requirement.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,False

Air Mauritius customer review,,2011-04-04,Flew back with my husband and 2 children from Mauritius last night in business class and was appalled at level of service onboard. No child meals in fact no child friendly food whatsoever. Considering it's such a long flight they should be more prepared for children travelling.

The seats were very uncomfortable seat pitch the smallest I have experienced on a long haul flight. The food was fine.

No chance of getting sleep in these seats. IFE didn't work properly and there are very few films or music to listen to - certainly not enough selection for a 12hr flight. Flight attendants friendly and polite and food was fine. Toilets don't appear to be cleaned during the flight so quite disgusting on a 12 hr flight. MRU-LHR in economy was similar. Boarding at MRU a mess. The queue from the gate weaved its way across most of the tiny terminal and was being processed very slowly. A lot of passengers getting angry.

Air Mauritius customer review,7,2011-03-14,CPT-MRU A319 Business Class. Fixed cabin of 16 seats (2-2) but 3-3 with the centre seat as a table. Good leg room for a regional flight although 5 hrs is a long time in a economy seat which it appears to be. It has an IFE box under the centre seat. Cabin service was good and food excellent - a 4 course lunch with a choice of 3 mains. Aircraft - one of only two of this type operate mainly MRU to South Africa. Overall good but a poor seat.

Could not read as an alternative to the non-on demand video because the light switch was incorrectly wired to illuminate the seat next to mine. Flight attendants nice enough but take a water bottle on board - they make no effort to carry water or juice along the aisles when the cabin lights are down. If you aren't in an aisle seat presumably you are just expected to dehydrate unless you climb over your sleeping fellow travellers to get to the galley. Food ordinary.

Air Mauritius customer review,1,2011-02-17,Seats on the Heathrow to Mauritius flight were hard provided no lumbar support and very uncomfortable. Some members of staff somewhat patronising and not very helpful. Headphone did not work and the food was awful. They do not serve the small bottles of wine and we were served tiny amounts of wine in plastic glasses I felt we were treated like children. When asked for two small glasses we were very patronisingly told that we have to wait for the next trolley - which was going to be a long time after the meal. My partner and I ordered vegetarian food and were served very small portions of very unappetising food and a fruit salad with acidic and unripe fruits. The next morning we were offered two small cold soft and doughy buns with margarine and jam. Not a pleasant trip.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Air Mauritius customer review,1,2011-02-04,Heathrow to Mauritius seats are very tight spaced. Staff quite unhelpful. In such a long haul flight they did not distribute water or juice after meal times nor did they advise passengers to help themselves with drinks in the catering area. I travelled with 18 month old twins - staff unhelpful and gave our kids meals with adults meals whilst distributing other kids meals earlier. Mauritius to Heathrow staff rude and spoke over our heads literally bitching about kids playing on the floor between passenger seats. They lack manners and customer service.

Things work so well from the Durban side but I have flown DUR-MRU-HKG return and JNB-MRU-LHR and by comparison the cabin crew this time barely managed a smile unless you grovelled. I don't expect to be glared at for asking for more bread. The return leg was pretty similar as far as staff went. Clearly nicer staff get to fly the longer routes. The most severe criticism I would make is the boarding leaving Mauritius. It is unjustifiable to leave long lines of passengers waiting for over an hour with no info nor telling us to all go sit down again. They knew perfectly well that they were running a full hour late as they later came up with the excuse that the plane was running late from Rodrigues! They pay lip service to priority boarding of business class passengers. Suddenly they announced a gate change so everyone had to scramble to change gates. Kept us waiting on the tarmac for the bus. What is the most appalling is that they kept 5 medical patients who were flying on the flight in wheelchairs waiting too in the line with no explanation to them.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,False
Air Mauritius customer review,,2010-12-23,LHR-MRU-LHR. LHR-MRU poor leg room most uncomfortable seats ever the entertainment system didn't work properly and staff were miserable. The MRU-LHR leg was a different story. We left MRU 3.5hours late due to the bad weather at LHR (snow). 3 hours from LHR captain announces the airport was shut so we were diverting to Milan-Malpensa. We landed and were shipped to a hotel. The following day our plane departed Milan for Paris without telling the passengers any information. Air Mauritius had one rep in Milan airport who ignored us another rep wouldn't speak with us. Very little information given to us we had to chase Air Mauritius at all times. They pretty much just abandoned us in Milan once we got off the plane. After 4 days of little information they left us to find our own way home. I certainly wouldn't recommend using Air Mauritius. The worst customer service I have ever experienced.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Air Mauritius customer review,6,2010-12-20,Mauritius-Singapore return Economy new A330 both legs. Seats quite hard but 7 hours flight is sustainable. I no longer rely on the IFE and always bring my IPAD. Flight was quite full but had no one seating to me on both legs and that is a major relief. Crew was performing basic service and not very friendly. The male staffs were more interested in female passengers. Come on MK you can do better!,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Air Mauritius customer review,,2010-11-30,Cape Town to Mauritius Mauritius to Heathrow. The most uncomfortable seats ever IFE box takes 25% of already limited legroom. Disinterested staff poor food - old planes with bits missing or not working.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Air Mauritius customer review,9,2010-09-21,"LON-MRU-LON in Business Class travelling with our baby daughter. I have to say the experience was very good indeed particularly on LON-MRU. The cabin crew in biz cabin were excellent attentive and polite. The food was of a good standard the sleeper beds (although not fully flat recline to an angle of 170 degrees) were comfortable - I am 6'3"" tall and could almost fully stretch out. Flights were on time outbound hours delay inbound. AVOD inflight entertainment system in biz class was good decent large screen in your armrest moderate selection of films to choose from. As a leisure airline Air Mauritius offered excellent value for money on this route compared to their only direct competitor (BA). Hold bags were priority tagged and did come off first at both ends. Our babies pushchair was also waiting at the aircraft door in both directions when we landed. Only slight let down is the Air Mauritius Lounge in MRU which is pretty poor and in need of a major makeover but a minor point in the overall travel experience.",False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Air Mauritius customer review,5,2010-09-19,LHR to MRU return in September 2010 (both night time flights). Found the seats cramped and uncomfortable not all of the headset jacks worked. The Flambouant aircraft appears to be less tired than The Chamarel one both Airbus 340's. Staff were helpful and polite we also appreciated the cabin lights being turned off after dinner however due to the severe lack of padding in the seats my legs and posterior spent more time asleep than I did. We do recommend flying with Air Mauritius but not for such a long journey.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Air Mauritius customer review,9,2010-09-18,Business Class (which was cheaper than I thought) in early September. No problems on the ground (though immigration at Mauritius a bit long winded) or in the air. Food wine and staff very good. Would have no hesitation in using them again.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Air Mauritius customer review,2,2010-09-17,Heathrow - Mauritius return. Outbound flight was appalling. The legroom in economy is the worst we've experienced. As already mentioned in other reviews the IFE box is situated under the seats so severely eats into the already cramped conditions. Cabin staff were generally surly and rude. One stewardess rammed the beverage trolley into my husband twice and poured hot tea in his lap without acknowledgement let alone an apology. Headphones didn't work. Toilets where dirty. Inbound was a slight improvement. The cabin staff where pleasant.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Air Mauritius customer review,8,2010-09-05,I travelled with my family from London Heathrow. We found the seats reasonably comfortable our 4 year old slept like a baby the whole flight out. The food was just fine with my wife and I enjoying our meals and our son was very happy with his. For the return flight my son fell asleep at takeoff so missed the normal meal time. When he woke up midflight the Flight Attendents had kept his meal and were quickly able to provide it resulting in a happy child who went straight back to sleep. Thank you for a good flight at a good price.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Air Mauritius customer review,8,2010-09-05,MRU-LHR return A340. The flight could have been brilliant if not for one stewardess on the first leg. Chief Purser and other crew more than helpful and caring. Food excellent on both legs compared to a recent previous trip. Some issues with toilets. Recurrent issues with the seats. IFE the same old story but beyond control of crew brought my Ipad and enjoyed my own movies.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Air Mauritius customer review,7,2010-08-30,MRU-HKG return - A330 on first leg ok with quite new plane. A340 on return a different story the plane is old. Outbound food was not to standard. Overall the service was quite ok respect the staff and they should provide good service. Return leg service much better as well as the food. The seats in Business are quite of a kind the fabric and the sloppy position pull you downwards.,False,,,Business Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Air Mauritius customer review,,2010-08-04,We flew from LHR in May and were appalled by the rude staff (preferential treatment to Mauritians) cramped seats with the IFE box taking up much of the legroom. The food was mediocre and toilets filthy. I have already complained to my travel agent (Sovereign) who to their credit managed to get a long response from Air Mauritius - sadly they didn't really pay much attention to my points and said how pleased they were that I'd been moved to a seat with more legroom (I wasn't). The staff spent the flight chatting at the back of the plane and passengers were expected to walk up to the galley and help themselves to drinks. I enjoyed the IFE - saw a few films which I enjoyed. We will go back to Mauritius as it is an amazing country but we will be flying a different airline next time no matter what the cost.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Air Mauritius customer review,2,2010-07-28,Heathrow to Mauritius. Staff friendly however we paid £100 premium for 2 seats with extra legroom. Neither of the entertainment screens worked - in fact one was not even attached properly to the cable which had been previously taped on by an amateur. 11 hours is a long time without music or a film. Also for some unknown reason a passenger was allowed to sit in the jumpseat seat throughout the whole journey. This was unacceptable as she was right in our vision and took up the extra leg space we had paid extra for. The flight steward apologised and gave us name of the vice president of Air Mauritius customer services. When we attempted to contact him  we were told that customer services would contact us via e mail. We are still waiting. This airline is not doing us a favour. We paid a large sum of money for the flights plus the extra leg room premium. Not happy at all.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Air Mauritius customer review,6,2010-07-24,Mauritius to Delhi. I found the quality of seats very average in the aircraft. In fact even in business class one of the seats couldn't move back. Worst of all the main attendant was rude and unfriendly. She didn't let me see my elderly parents travelling separately in business class the whole flight knowing that they may need my help / assistance in spite of repeated requests. Very disappointed.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,1,,,False
Air Mauritius customer review,7,2010-07-09,PER-MRU-LHR MRU-PER. Not too bad an airline. A340 aircraft are reliable however Air Mauritius need to review their seats which are quite hard for long haul flights and worn in some cases. Food is average but cabin staff friendly and efficient. In flight entertainment could be upgraded. Checkin and boarding very efficient.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
Air Mauritius customer review,7,2010-07-02,LHR-MRU-LHR. Air Mauritius use their most modern A340's on the London route which are quiet and smooth. Sat in economy and was surprised at how tight the legroom is and I'm only 5ft 9in. That was the only real negative about the flight. IFE boxes are also under each seat which limits your ability to stretch out your legs. I'm used to BA and Virgin's economy cabins which are more spacious. IFE was ok but not enough choice for a 12hr flight. Food was pretty good and tasty. Staff were pleasant and happy to help with requests.,False,,,Economy Class,,,,,,,4,,,True
