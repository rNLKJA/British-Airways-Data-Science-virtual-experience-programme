## Background

British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive to and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. Whether it’s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.

As a data scientist at BA, it will be your job to apply your analytical skills to influence real life multi-million-pound decisions from day one, making a tangible impact on the business as your recommendations, tools and models drive key business decisions, reduce costs and increase revenue.

Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.

This first task is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights you may uncover.

## Tasks

The first thing to do will be to scrape review data from the web. For this, you should use a website called Skytrax.

The team leader wants you to focus on reviews specifically about the airline itself. You should collect as much data as you can in order to improve the output of your analysis. To get started with the data collection, you can use the “Jupyter Notebook” in the Resources section below to run some Python code that will help to collect some data.

**Analyse data**

    Once you have your dataset, you need to prepare it. The data will be very messy and contain purely text. You will need to perform data cleaning in order to prepare the data for analysis. When the data is clean, you should perform your own analysis to uncover some insights. As a starting point, you could look at topic modelling, sentiment analysis or wordclouds to provide some insight into the content of the reviews. It is recommended to complete this task using Python, however, you can use any tool that you wish. You can use some of the documentation websites provided in the Resources section below to analyse the data.

Please ensure that you have created a folder called "data" and mapped your file path.

**Present insights**

    Your manager would like you to summarise your findings within a single PowerPoint slide, so that they can present the results at the next board meeting. You should create visualisations and metrics to include within this slide, as well as clear and concise explanations in order to quickly provide the key points from your analysis. Use the “PowerPoint Template” provided to complete the slide.
